    <h1 id="phase-iib">Phase IIB</h1>
<p>Supplemental funding opportunity applicable for SBIR and STTR Phase II awardees.</p>

<p>The objective of Phase IIB funding is to provide additional R&amp;D funds to further accelerate commercialization of the Phase II project, when a qualifying third party financial investment/commitment has been received as a direct consequence of the NSF funded Phase I/Phase II research outcomes. The third party funding should serve to accelerate commercialization activity of the NSF funded Phase II Program.</p>

<h2 id="overall-submission-and-review-process">Overall submission and review process</h2>

<h3 id="request-timing">Request timing</h3>
<p>Phase II grantees are encouraged to start discussing any Phase IIB requests as early as possible with the Program Director on the Grant. The grantee may be invited to submit a formal Financial Package after initial review by the Program Director. The Financial Package must be submitted to the Program Director for review at least a month in advance of the expiry date of the grant to initiate formal NSF review. The Program Director may recommend that the Grantee request approval for a no-cost extension (to extend the grant expiry date by up to 6 months) to allow NSF time to review the Phase IIB supplement request.</p>

<h3 id="process-overview">Process overview</h3>
<p>For companies requesting <strong>$250,000 or less</strong> of NSF Phase IIB matching funds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PI is invited by the Program Director to submit a formal Phase IIB Financial Package along with an outline of what R&amp;D will be done with a potential NSF Phase IIB match.</li>
  <li>The Financial Package is internally reviewed by NSF, and the PI receives feedback from the Program Director on what third party funds would qualify for the Phase IIB match.</li>
  <li>The PI receives permission from the Program Director to submit the Phase IIB proposal after NSF review of the Financial Package.</li>
  <li>The Phase IIB proposal is reviewed by NSF.</li>
  <li>The award may typically extend the expiry date of the grant by 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p>For companies <strong>requesting over $250,000</strong> (not to exceed $500,000) of NSF Phase IIB matching funds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PI is invited by the Program Director to submit a formal Phase IIB Financial Package along with an outline of what R&amp;D will be done with a potential NSF Phase IIB match.</li>
  <li>The Financial Package is internally reviewed by NSF and the PI receives feedback from the Program Director on what third party funds would qualify for the Phase IIB match.</li>
  <li>The Program Director invites the company to make an on-site presentation at NSF for review of the proposed Phase IIB R&amp;D program and the company’s commercialization plans. The company is provided details on what should be covered in the on-site presentation.</li>
  <li>The grantee company (including a minimum of the PI and CEO) presents in person at NSF to an audience of NSF staff. A representative of the third party must be available at the meeting (in person or on the phone).</li>
  <li>The Program Director may have further discussions with the grantee after the on-site meeting.</li>
  <li>The PI receives permission from the Program Director to submit the Phase IIB proposal after NSF review of the Financial Package.</li>
  <li>The Phase IIB proposal is reviewed by NSF.</li>
  <li>The award may typically extend the expiry date of the grant by 24 months.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="review-criteria">Review criteria</h3>
<p>All Phase IIB proposals will be reviewed in-house by a minimum of two NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officers. Each proposal will be reviewed based on the review criteria below.</p>

<p>Criterion: What is the <strong>intellectual merit</strong> of the proposed activity? Potential considerations: Will the completion of the proposed activity lead to a solid foundation of the scientific and engineering knowledge and understanding base? Has the firm progressed satisfactorily in the Phase II activity to justify a Phase IIB activity? Is the proposed plan a sound approach for establishing technical feasibility that could lead to commercialization?</p>

<p>Criterion: What are the <strong>broader impacts</strong> of the proposed activity? Potential considerations: Does the commercialization plan summary in the proposed activity show a clear path to commercial and societal benefits? Does the proposed activity reflect changes to the Phase II commercialization plan that further improves the chances of conversion of research in order to provide societal benefits? What are the expectations of the third party, and how effective will the third party funded activity lead to commercial and societal benefit? Evaluate the competitive advantages of this technology vs. alternate technologies that can meet similar market needs.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-funding-qualifications-and-use">Third Party Funding Qualifications and Use</h2>

<h3 id="qualifying-third-party-funds">Qualifying Third Party Funds</h3>
<p>Qualifying third party funds should meet these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The company and the documentation provided (henceforth referred to as the “Financial Package”) will need to clearly establish that the third party is making investments/financial commitments as a direct consequence of the outcomes of NSF funded Phase I and/or Phase II Grant activity and it is not contingent on the company receiving the Phase IIB grant.</li>
  <li>The Financial Package will need to include executed legal agreements signed by both the grantee company and the third party. The Financial Package must clearly specify the amount of the investments/financial commitments being made. The third party funding must be cash, but not in-kind or other “intangible assets”. Loans and any forms of debt obligations, will not qualify.</li>
  <li>The Financial Package should involve money legally obligated to the grantee company with no attached contingencies or conditions that will result in the return of any funds back to the third party.</li>
  <li>The transfer of funds to the grantee could occur up-front or, over a clearly defined contracted date-certain payment schedule, and proof of receipt of the third party money will need to be provided to NSF to receive matching Phase IIB funds.</li>
  <li>The legal agreements in the Financial Package need to have been executed prior to formal NSF review of eligibility for Phase IIB supplemental funding.</li>
  <li>Funds from multiple unrelated third parties may be presented in a combined Financial Package. This may be particularly the case where the third party money is the result of sales, licensing, etc.</li>
  <li>Any third-party investment funds in excess of $500,000 must come from private-sector (non-governmental) sources. <strong>Definition of a Third party investor:</strong> <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/fastlane/definitions/#third-party-investor">https://seedfund.nsf.gov/fastlane/definitions/#third-party-investor</a></li>
  <li>Amount of third party funds</li>
  <li>The Financial Package must include a minimum of $100,000 of qualifying funds. NSF will match up to 50% of qualifying funds received. Phase IIB supplemental awards will be made for a minimum of $50,000 and a maximum of $500,000.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-of-third-party-funds">Use of third party funds</h3>
<p>NSF does not place restrictions on how the grantee spends the third party funds. R&amp;D, market research, advertising, intellectual property development, capital investment, business development, human resource development are some examples of typical uses for the third-party funds, with the overall goal of accelerating commercialization of the NSF funded technology being developed in the Phase II grant.</p>

<h3 id="use-of-nsf-phase-iib-funds">Use of NSF Phase IIB funds</h3>
<p>NSF match funds shall only be used for research &amp; development activities that further build on the Phase II program and catalyze acceleration towards commercialization.</p>

<h2 id="phase-iib-proposal-preparation">Phase IIB Proposal Preparation</h2>
<p>Phase IIB proposals MUST be submitted using FastLane. The Phase IIB proposal shall not exceed 15 pages. The additional work proposed should be an expansion of the technical work being performed in the Phase II project and must fall within the scope of the present Phase II project. The proposal will contain the following:</p>

<h3 id="the-phase-iib-match-will-typically-be-released-under-the-following-schedule">The Phase IIB match will typically be released under the following schedule:</h3>

<p>For Phase IIB supplements up to $250,000 (12 month extension) 50% will be released as the advance payment and 50% with an approved 6-month interim report.</p>

<p>For Phase IIB supplements greater than $250,000 (24 month extension) 25% will be released as the advance payment; 25% with an approved 6-month interim report; 25% with an approved 12-month interim report and 25% with an approved 18-month interim report.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payments will be released upon receipt of proof that the funds have been transferred from the third party to the NSF grantee, typically in the form of a bank statement. Therefore, the payment schedules above may be modified according to the details of the release schedule of the third party money if these funds are not provided up-front. That is, NSF funds (50% match) will only be disbursed at any given time according to the amount of third party funds for which NSF has been provided proof of receipt.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reporting-requirements">Reporting Requirements</h2>

<p>In updating the milestone chart, the reports due during the Phase IIB supplement period should reflect the progress of both the Phase II and IIB programs using the standard progress report format. Upon completion of the Phase IIB, complete documentation, including initial Phase II as well as Phase IIB supplemental activities must be reported.</p>
