"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II Project aims to tackle the two greatest barriers to technology adoption associated with metal additive manufacturing (AM) - cost and quantities. Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable Fortify to provide U.S. manufacturers with a disruptive manufacturing technology to create low-volume tooling parts with order of magnitude reductions in lead times and part price. U.S. manufacturers rely on prototype and low-volume production parts that are currently produced using aluminum soft tooling that need to be precision machined. Prices for these small run parts can reach USD $10,000 or more per tool, depending on complexity, with lead times extending weeks or months. This results in high unit costs when parts are produced in low volumes. Industry data suggests the market for outsourced prototype and low volume injection molded parts with physical dimensions serviceable by Fortify technology may be as large as USD $2.7 Billion.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable Fortify to create a thermal competitive advantage to enable customer discovery in the field of low-volume injection molding tooling. Despite the noise in the field of 3D printing, disrupting the injection molding tooling industry has remained elusive due to the lasting need for high strength, thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and smooth mold finish in 3D printed molds. Fortify is uniquely positioned to address these technical challenges by leveraging novel materials, patented manufacturing hardware, and proprietary manufacturing software. Fortify prints ceramic-filled, high-temperature resins that are locally textured by magnetic fields in customized magnetic printers to produce optimum ceramic microstructures designed by Fortify's INFORM software to maximize the thermomechanical performance of the printed parts.

"abstractText": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer
(STTR) Phase I project is to empower providers with the unprecedented ability to treat patients
with chronic inflammatory skin disease effectively and at a lower cost. Today, primary care
physicians often refer patients with these conditions to dermatologists for the initial diagnosis
and multiple follow-up appointments, especially when patients are prescribed high cost, high
touch therapies like biologics or procedures, such as phototherapy. By introducing this
automated severity scoring system, these providers will have the expertise of dermatologists at
their fingertips, giving them the ability to assess disease severity and provide systemic
treatments previously available only through specialists. It will also establish more objective
assessments, evaluating patient progress to adjust dosage and treatments as necessary. For
pharmaceutical companies, the ability to have non-specialists make these severity assessments
during clinical trials reduces expensive and restrictive staffing requirements. Less expensive trials can
help expedite new drugs to market. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological
understanding by applying known machine learning techniques in a novel manner to solve a
difficult visual problem.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will prototype a clinical tool
that can assess images of a chronic skin inflammation, determine its severity, and suggest
treatment. This system will be able to guide users with minimal training through the image
collection process, determine if the information is sufficient, and request additional information if
required via novel machine learning techniques. Currently, clinicians trying to assess the
severity of chronic inflammatory skin diseases rely on a series of estimations and manual
weighted averages, a time consuming and biased process. This Phase I research will explore
what information is necessary for an algorithm to determine the severity of a psoriasis case. It
will determine if it is possible for a machine to guide an imager through imaging regions of
interest at higher detail, rather than the entire body at large. It will also explore how quickly and
practically such a calculation can be performed. The end goal of the project is a working
prototype that can consistently score a few psoriasis cases and serve as a proof of concept for
expansion of the prototype in future work.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project builds a new query engine for K12 that addresses four major shortcomings in existing automated question-answering systems. The shortcomings prevent both students and teachers from fully leveraging the power of such systems. Existing systems 1) cannot handle raw student queries like - Ten Ford Fiestas cost $146,000. How much does each Ford Fiesta cost?, 2) do not take into account students' skill-levels to return results that is within the scope of their understanding, 3) do not have a community vetting and feedback mechanism that allows systems to learn the quality of their automated answers, and 4) discard valuable insights obtainable from students' queries that can be used to inform future classroom instruction. The query engine, which is free to use, addresses all four shortcomings, improves classroom instruction and closes the achievement gap. It empowers students of all abilities and from all communities to obtain automated answers from the AI technology and regular answers from the community of users. The community of users on the platform range from students to teachers to experts from the industry fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities. The platform is compliant with federal and state privacy regulations and is projected to earn significant Annual Recurring Revenue from corporations and EdTech companies seeking to build their brand among the K12 community. 


This project develops new skill-aware AI technology that automatically maps student's raw queries into topics, sub-topics and intent. The technology considers the user skill-levels and automatically constructs an answer extracted from the most relevant educational resources, with highest preference given to teachers' own resources. The technology does something more if the detected topic falls under Algebra and the intent of the query is 'How do I solve this?' It generates, on-the-fly, additional scaffolding instructions for solving the problem. This approach extends to disciplines beyond Algebra. In addition, Phase I research leverages the latest advancements in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Topic Detection to extract and track skill-levels, as well as strengths and weaknesses of students for teacher's benefit. Finally, the project will also demonstrate the efficacy of the technology in terms of queries made, relevant responses generated and its impact in terms of Algebra math outcomes.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide software service to correct Earth observation satellite (EOS) data to at-ground reflectance. EOS must look through the Earth?s atmosphere that induces systematic error in measuring the actual reflectance of ground targets through scatter and attenuation of light. Atmospherically-induced error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity, dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications for global monitoring, defense and agriculture. The value of data could make this a significant and growing market opportunity if the specifications are met successfully.        

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to correct aerosol-induced error in EOS data by reversing the effect, found empirically to be structured, independent of aerosol type and potentially predictable through measurement of dark target-reflectance ? water bodies clear of aquatic vegetation, entrained sediment and specular reflectance from windblown waves. The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated with dark targets. Once developed and proofed, the algorithm will be brought to the Landsat 8 Cal/Val team for validation.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be safer and more secure IoT platforms that will contribute to the growth of the IoT market. Current security technologies in the IoT arena are either weak or expensive (usually both). The weakness in conventional approaches lies in their impractical goal of finding and fixing all security vulnerabilities. Modern systems have complexity that vastly outstrips the capabilities of any human or verification tool to find all the security vulnerabilities. The only way to somewhat mitigate this weakness is to throw significant resources at the problem, which is very expensive and still yields an imperfect result. The proposed technology developed in this SBIR Phase I project will provide practical and strong security. It gains these important properties by assuming that all systems are riddled with vulnerabilities, so it builds in security by making IoT computing devices that are unsolvable puzzles to attackers. In addition, it doesn't rely on IoT developers to deploy hand-crafted defenses; instead, developers simply build their applications on the proposed platform, and they receive all of its security benefits.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new direction in IoT security. Unlike the world of IoT security today, where developers and tools are attempting to find and fix every last security vulnerability (and always failing), the technology being developed is a hardware-based secure IoT technology that is impractically difficult to penetrate. It achieves this by engaging ensembles of moving target defenses (EMTDs) on the runtime information that attackers need to build their attacks. To overcome EMTDs, attackers must extensively probe the system to acquire the run-time information obscured by moving target defenses. To stop these probes, the technology utilizes a technology called churn to re-key moving target defenses while the system is in operation. Once the churn mechanism is engaged, attackers will have to start their attack over again from scratch. With churn cycles of 50ms (or less), the proposed secure IoT platform becomes impractically difficult to breach, across a broad array of attack classes. The work proposed in this SBIR Phase I project will advance the technology from simulation to a real hardware implementation, which will allow the technology to be deployed into the IoT marketplace.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over 10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job, while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings to the healthcare system may also be obtained. 

The proposed project will develop a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration should ensue."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) computing in conjunction with silicon nanoelectronics. The value of nanoelectronics utilizing silicon integrated with CNT has been shown to have immense potential through various academic studies. However, the transition of this technology from academia to industry has been stymied by lack of CNT material that meets the manufacturing requirements particularly in terms of alignment, purity, and compatibility to be properly explored. Monolithic 3D integration will enable game-changing levels of improvement to computing speed and power efficiency, creating better computing for all. Providing a material which accelerates research and development for improved computing will create a game changing impact on the $500B integrated circuit market and potentially create billions of dollars in revenue. This project is focused on the needs of the nanoelectronics industry because of the impact possible in that market, but other markets such as biosensing or flexible electronics would benefit from the same materials and often at relaxed specifications.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will greatly expand the utilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in nanoelectronics by making industrially relevant material available. This will allow application oriented nanoelectronics teams to move forward with R&D projects. Further, the project's work on the fundamentals of aligned CNT growth and purification will benefit the CNT materials community by the extension of the material into commercial manufacturing. The research objectives are on two fronts: 1) growth of CMOS compatible aligned CNTs and 2) purification of aligned CNTs. Growth of highly aligned CNT populations has typically utilized catalysts which are not compatible with front end of line CMOS fabrication, hindering the use of material in conjunction with Si integrated circuits. Current methods of CNT purification to remove metallic CNTs suffer from either destroying the critical CNT alignment, utilization of non-CMOS compatible materials, or the need of extensive post-processing. This project will develop a growth process and a purification process that preserves alignment while maintaining CMOS compatibility and utilizes wafer scale batch processes that allow high throughput manufacturing. The purification scheme is a proprietary method which must be characterized and refined to meet the exacting purification standards of 99.99% semiconducting CNTs or better.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a shift towards both accuracy and affordability within the world of energy sub-metering.  This metering system will have a dramatic impact on the market for submetering commercial real estate. By drastically reducing the cost and knowledge hurdles associated with accurate submetering and bringing the costs of submetering in line with value, this technology opens the door for a mass-market approach to circuit-level energy use data. The market for this commercial submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies. Additionally, it is estimated that access to metering data alone can reduce energy consumption within a building between 5% and 15%, meaning a wide deployment of these technologies could have wide-reaching environmental and energy security benefits.  

The proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in true power metering by providing revenue quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting, as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit design, embedded software architecture and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested. Specific key technical objectives include creating a daisy-chain framework through which individual nodes within a metering system can share energy and data, improving accuracy in the myriad of potential field conditions, and creating a system of runtime-diagnostics to identify, and fix, human error in real time. Study and pursuit of these objectives will take place both in the lab, as well is in the field, where installation and accuracy can be benchmarked against conventional hardwired metering solutions.

The proposed multi-bit non-volatile memory (NVM) based Deep Neural Networks (DNN) IP is based on the standard CMOS logic processes. Existing solution for the DNN hardware typically requires off-chip access to retrieve neural network parameters from external memories, incurring additional communication latency and power consumption. Additionally, when critical neural network parameters are transmitted off-chip, security or privacy concern may arise, which is unacceptable especially for the applications such as personalized AI devices. Alternative approach integrating the DNN engine in a special NVM process requires as much as 10 additional masks beyond the conventional logic CMOS process which is not cost-effective for medium density DNN engine in cost-sensitive edge devices. With this proposed IP, any existing or new system on chip requiring persistent AI functionality can be built quickly and cost effectively.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a cost-effective non-volatile neural network accelerator IP for edge devices. To solve the security, latency, power consumption, and cost issues associated with the traditional approaches, a single-poly based low cost, non-volatile, multi-bit eFlash cell is proposed. Multi-bit cell operation however presents significant challenges due to inherent reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. Key technical hurdles include solving disturbances of unselected cells, improving sensing margin, and overcoming reliability issues associated with high voltage operation in readout circuits as well as developing robust neural network cell arrays. To address these challenges, several new ideas related to multi-bit cell, high-voltage circuits, and cell programming methods have been proposed. Once verified successfully in this project, the multi-bit cell IP can then be integrated as logic compatible non-volatile memory to store neural network parameters on-chip, or as logic compatible non-volatile neural network IP to execute entire neural network operation.

This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation.

The technology developed in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources. Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently inaccessible to the chemical industry. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable production of the target chemicals."

More importantly, the lessons learned during this project could, if successful, bring about the emergence of breakthrough energy-autonomous real-time tracking technologies that would significantly increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of worldwide container shipping as well as provide a direct value that could bring about the adoption of the smart container. The container shipping industry stands as one of the unsung heroes of the modern world which, from its birth in the 1960s, cut the cost of shipping goods across the globe by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling global trade on a massive scale and catalyzing the world?s economic development. Nevertheless, this industry has remained largely unmoved by the advent of big data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This innovation could empower the general introduction and leveraging of such tools, further lower the costs and increase the accessibility of worldwide shipping, and significantly benefit the world and the United States? economies.

The proposed project will require, on the road towards commercialization, the exploration of the properties of backscatter mm-wave localization approaches and channels in complex highly cluttered environments such as that of metallic-parts-crowded repair facilities and terminals covered with container stacks. While significant research efforts are currently invested in the characterization and mapping of mm-wave transmission channels necessary to the planning and rolling out of upcoming cellular 5G networks, no such work has yet been reported for their backscatter counterparts, nor for localization purposes. In addition, although the influence of channels for standard Radio Frequency IDentification-based localization systems has benefited from decades of investigation, that of its higher-frequency correspondent is virtually unexplored and should display different properties and present novel challenges and opportunities, due to major differences in clutter diffraction and absorption. The work will start with the finalization of tag and reader hardware in view of the gathering of detection data in the aforementioned environments, followed by the formulation of the high-performance signal processing schemes used to retrieve tag positions and identities, developed hand in hand with optimized communications modulation schemes for the tags. Finally, a tuning of the devised numerical processing schemes for high-speed embedded processing will take place.

Our company would solve this through the implementation of a closed loop sensor system which would remotely determine the efficiency of sprayer machines and the spray pattern of the material continuously and in real time. Farmers will benefit through reduced costs of wasted materials resulting from over-spraying, while feeling safe against pest and fungus infestation resulting from under-spraying. The initial intended customers are large orchards, vineyards and tree farms. Those farmers generally use airblast sprayers which are highly inefficient and waste about 45% of the material. Those chemicals either hit the ground and contaminate it or pollute the air.  An owner of a large farm that implements our proposed device will save a significant amount on chemical costs and also avoids the consequences due to drift of chemicals onto neighboring farms, public roads, or non-agricultural areas. 

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to introduce a new technology to the agricultural sector. This technology has been previously built for complex and sophisticated applications in mostly academia and government sectors. We look to provide a new functionality while reducing the size and cost of the technology. It would be used as a new and improved method of calibration, replacing a tedious and often ignored current process. Furthermore, the sensor would be integrated as a closed loop system for autonomous sprayer adjustments. A complete software solution would accompany the hardware in order to make it approachable to the non-scientific community. This project will prove the potential of our technology as a competitive player in the rapidly growing ag-tech field.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of quantum computers that will impact many technologies by enabling, for example, molecular simulations for drug design and catalyst development for energy applications, quantum machine learning, and solving optimization problems such as scheduling. Scalable, universal quantum computing promises to be one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era. The range of applications are broad and will only expand with the development of new quantum algorithms, with one of the biggest opportunities being molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For example, despite being a multi-billion dollar industry, computational drug discovery is limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, qubit numbers must be increased several orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The proposed innovation of trapping and individual control of neutral atoms will, if successful, enable quantum computers to scale to the thousands of qubits needed for error-corrected, universal quantum computing.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology for scalable trapping and addressing of neutral atom qubits through dynamic, parallelized optical trapping and individual addressing of alkaline earth qubits. Neutral atoms are an emerging platform for quantum computing and the majority of work thus far has been directed towards alkali atoms (i.e., those with a single valence electron). Alkaline earth atoms have two valence electrons and correspondingly a richer energy level structure, which has demonstrated very long trapped coherence times.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable broad market adoption of rooftop and other methods for local wind energy generation through reduction in costs. This is achieved through development of technology designed to lower the cost of wind turbine drive trains and associated power electronics, high cost items which are often left without innovation in new wind turbine designs. Prohibitively high costs are currently the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of distributed wind turbines, and power electronics can be as much as 50% of these costs. Significant cost reduction has the potential to increase worldwide distributed wind power adoption. The innovative power train technology developed in this project is specifically designed to couple with a proprietary technology for wind capture at rooftop edges. When combined with this technology, costs estimates are competitive with rooftop solar energy, enabling wind energy to become a common addition to rooftop solar installations. Successful deployment of this technology will contribute to society by decreasing the carbon footprint of energy production, increasing energy resiliency, and creating new jobs associated with manufacturing and deployment. Significant manufacturing efforts are likely to remain in the US, creating local job opportunities and economic growth. 


This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to use a novel drive train architecture to reduce small wind turbine power train costs. In this architecture, costs are lowered by temporarily storing the energy coming out of the wind turbine rotor in a flywheel before passing it on to the generator. This allows for the power train to include a generator and inverter that are sized for average rather than peak power outputs, enables removal of diversion load, and allows for the use of a faster spinning, and therefore lower cost generator. The Phase I project seeks to prove the feasibility of developing a low-cost flywheel which meets the needs of the overall drive train (including efficiency and reliability), a powertrain control system which maintains high efficiency, and a powertrain system configuration which maintains the reduced cost projections required for market traction. Research efforts include development of a bench-scale drive train to test the controls of the flywheel, powertrain simulation to test alternative generator and converter topologies, and benchmarking of generator candidates to determine efficiency and power density.

HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials."

Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale."

"abstractText": "This STTR Phase I project will develop a transformative platform for inexpensive screening for pancreatic cancer detection, based on profiling of cancer-related proteins from a small blood draw.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, killing over 50,000 each year in the US, and with a five-year survival rate below 7%.  However, currently there are no reliable diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, and the great majority of cases are detected at a late stage, with bleak mortality rates as a result.  As cancer is driven fundamentally by a dysregulation of key protein networks, directly measuring the activity of key proteins provides a robust bio-signature for cancer detection. The project will develop a scientifically novel diagnostic technology based on broad protein profiling for the accurate and low cost detection of pancreatic cancer, and thereby shift the therapeutic field of battle to an earlier stage of the disease, where the current treatments can be more effectively harnessed to improve patient outcomes and save lives, avoid unnecessary and ineffective procedures, and generate health system cost savings across the US and elsewhere. Commercialization of this diagnostic platform is expected to drive creation of a substantial enterprise, and related employment and tax-revenues.

The major innovation of this project is the breakthrough technology for monitoring the state of dozens of cancer-related proteins in biological samples and its application for diagnosing pancreatic cancer from a minute sample of a patient?s blood. The innovative platform has superior levels of sensitivity and accuracy compared to existing technologies, and also offers substantially lower costs, which are critical advantages for the diagnostic application. A further innovation in this project is the development of the analytic engine and the bio-signature knowledge base, that will be used for analysis of the patient?s protein profile.  In this project, the Company will focus on several key technical challenges to develop and validate a 1.0 version of its diagnostic platform for pancreatic cancer detection:  i. identifying a robust, differentiated multi-target, bio-signature for pancreatic cancer; and ii. doing so with an accuracy and at a sufficiently early stage in the cancer emergence and progression to be medically useful. This project will extensively profile biobank samples from various stages of pancreatic cancer and normal patients to generate the differentiated bio-signatures, develop a diagnosis prediction engine to match the bio-signatures and inform diagnoses, and validate those results using additional samples.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly lower the cost and expand the number of addressable markets for ice thermal energy storage. Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.

Prior to their internships in Poland, students will spend the academic year working in research laboratory at Adelphi University developing essential technical skills relevant to the proposed research. This early-career research experience will enhance the professional training and education of the US undergraduate students by exposing them to modern instrumentation, advanced nanotechnology research, and its practical application. IRES students will develop global competencies through experiential education in an international environment motivating and inspiring young US researchers to invest in future research careers and become agents of change in today?s world. 

Research efforts will focus on fabrication and characterization of nanohybrids combining CdX (X=S, Se) thin films with conducting polymers and wide-bandgap semiconducting metal oxides for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Detailed studies of the nanohybrids formation process and their characterization will help to identify the key parameters influencing the semiconductor heterojunction quality, such as: materials? choice, their synthesis and processing, in order to correlate their composition, structure and performance. The experiments proposed in this project will test this hypothesis.

This technology will enable the ability to provide personalized treatment for patients, and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market more rapidly.  The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups, a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently, 70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development costs while simultaneously improving patient care by selecting the correct treatment for each patient. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents vs. non-respondents) and/or subtypes of disease (aggressive vs. non-aggressive). The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This Phase II project proposes to extend this technology to integrate genomic and clinical data.

Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is  the development of an improved methane sensor module that can enables new drone sensing and sensor network applications in the energy, agricultural, and waste management sectors. Methane, the third largest energy source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power, weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural, waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor product line. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising sensor technology from a small business research and development project into the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. 


This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to create a self-contained methane sensor system, smaller in size than a quarter, with the sensitivity of advanced laser spectrometers. Current methods of detection do not meet the needs of industry. They are either cheap, high power and low sensitivity, such as catalyst-based systems, or they are large, expensive, high power optical systems. There is a market need for methane sensors that improve upon size, weight and power, while still maintaining useful sensitivity and selectivity. The system consists of 3 primary modules: the replaceable or consumable sensor package, the sense electronics, and the data storage and communication system. Due to the extremely low power requirements of the sensor, clever design of the data and communications system is critical if the low power benefits of the sensor are to be realized in a product. Ultimately, the system will include wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Zigbee) for cloud and IoT data management. This design will be prototyped and will undergo performance measurements. Materials for methane sensing will be identified  The objective of SBIR Phase 1 is to produce an initial prototype sensor for methane-sensing that will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the global challenge of pollution abatement and air purification which have a profound impact on the environment, health, and economy. Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on emission control activities, yet air pollution costs the global economy over five trillion of dollars annually in welfare costs and is attributed to one in every eight deaths. The design and performance of current industrial catalytic air purification technologies is insufficient to treat the growing number of airborne pollutants. Finding sustainable, cost-effective solutions to this problem, and is becoming increasingly important in view of tightening regulations. The technology we propose has a high commercialization potential due to the fact that it is cost-effective, shows excellent long-term performance and potential for scalable fabrication within an existing manufacturing framework within the United States.  Further, the founders of the company are inventors of the technology and have exclusive licensing of the core IP. Significantly, our demonstration of operating temperature reductions has been well-received by industry as evidenced by findings from our customer discovery effort through programs such as NSF I-Corps.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses outstanding challenges in catalytic converters, notably technical challenges associated with cold start, durability, and high cost, which can be attributed to the use of substantial amounts of platinum group metals, and reliance on the limited reserves of these metals. Through highly controlled composition and nano-, micro-, and macro- structuration, we have previously demonstrated dramatically reduced precious metal content in a catalytic decomposition of known pollutants. The research objectives of this SBIR project are to develop a scalable deposition method of these advanced catalytic materials onto industrially relevant substrates, to promote and accelerate their integration into commercial products to tackle the growing problem of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The technical work will involve the synthesis of these materials and modifications to the synthetic schemes in a way that will be compatible with such large-scale deposition processes, as well as longevity, robustness, and catalytic testing. It will require building equipment for the deposition. Overcoming the technological challenges that are the subject of this SBIR Project will facilitate translation of the nanostructured materials to a broad range of catalytic applications related to pollution abatement and air purification.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project develops chemical tools and platforms to produce valuable chemical building blocks that can be used to produce synthetically challenging compounds on large scales. These compounds belong to the class of polypropionates which is known for its diverse and powerful biological activities across multiple indications within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and veterinary industries. The high impact of the polypropionate class is hampered by the inefficiencies of current chemical processes to fully tackle their complex structures. Importantly, the lack of scalability adds another severe complication to the development process. To fully unlock the potential of this class, improved chemistries with greater efficiencies are required to successfully identify high impact candidates for further development. Moreover, the new tools are excellent substrates for polyketide?{enhanced drug discovery. This project is a prelude to the development of a novel class of compounds against rare and unmet needs in cancer in collaboration with the NCI/NIH. Such cancers pose a huge burden on the healthcare system and the economy in general. Inspired by the NSF mission, this project describes an innovative chemical process that can deliver highly valuable compounds. Such an approach will enable accelerated discoveries across multiple medicinal and agrochemical needs.

This project aims to provide all sixteen possible stereotetrad building blocks (in the form of chiral lactones) for construction of polypropionates on practical scales. Those chiral building blocks can serve as common precursors for synthesis of polypropionates, as tools for rational design and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, or as entries for more diverse and complex library of analogs. The chemistry platform used to produce those building blocks is referred to as the Chiral Carbon Catalog (CCC). The CCC platform is a synthetic tool box that allows stereoselective large scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate building blocks from simple starting materials. The unified process has been carefully designed to employ highly diastereoselective substrate directed transformations while avoiding expensive and impractical chiral auxiliary overheads or expensive catalysts. The high efficiencies of transformations allow the elimination of tedious and expensive purifications such as column chromatography. The crystalline natures of key intermediates enable facile production on scale and allow the synthetic routes used by the platform to be easily adopted by the industry for large scale production. This ensures adequate supply of those building blocks for development of complex chiral products within several industries (e.g. pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields)."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales."

Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project targets the fabrication of devices capable of focusing X-rays with high energy (from 10 keV to above 100 keV) to spot sizes as small as 7 nanometers.  This capability is critical for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses of materials and will permit imaging in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable today. These devices will enable scientists to better image the interplay of structure and functionality for a wide variety of applications, including the development of life-saving drugs, the creation of materials for high-tech devices, and for a number of important basic scientific purposes. The devices? primary use will be in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with in specialized industrial and research environments. These devices form a special class of high-value consumables, addressing a global market segment worth about $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the near future. 

The intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently, polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third, the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.

Americans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in
minutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase
in the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A
miniaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more
available and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The
strategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders
with this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when
in proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in
first response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.
Through this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a
regulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes
researching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical
medical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized

Smartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching
electronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the
required energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)

a user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to
locate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that
demonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of

The commercial impact from this innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials, such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost, efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills, oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded, successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex, multi-component materials.    

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.

It is noteworthy that there are more than 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% of greenhouse gases and 70% of emissions come from the transportation sector, and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of fuel: petroleum. Mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is essential if the U.S. is to gain energy security and substantially reduce carbon emissions. The electric car industry has passed its tipping point; however, electric vehicles are still in the very early stages of development. Like early computers, the pieces that make up an electric car are large, heavy, costly and unable to efficiently communicate amongst themselves. The proposed technology not only reduces the volume, cost, and weight of onboard chargers for electric vehicles, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation to support future Smart Grid functionalities. This project will lead to creating jobs once the technology matures toward commercialization.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to design and development of an innovative integrated and bidirectional onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. These converters are heavy, bulky, costly and need to communicate over a variety of controller area networks. The intellectual merit of this project is in the innovative topology, design, control, development, packaging, and validation of the first charger which integrates an onboard charger and an auxiliary power module. This SBIR Phase I project involves the design of the converter, investigation and design of the controller, design and implementation of the electromagnetic interference filter stage, creating the schematics and layout, thermal management, reliability analyses, enclosure design, and final alpha prototype assembly and verification. This important work will (1) lead to theoretical advancements in the design, control, and integration of power electronic converters, (2) involve interdisciplinary research in power electronics, control, packaging, and thermal management, and (3) lead to commercialization of the first integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.

The global water scarcity, including some parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently, there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water, and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies. To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs. The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water reuse. 

The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology; and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine its cost-effectiveness."

Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen >23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available.

The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 > 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria."

Energy use in buildings represents roughly 40% of total U.S. energy demand. It is projected that over half the buildings that will be in use in 2050 are already built. Retrofitting existing buildings with smart windows that regulate/monitor sunlight transmission could reduce building energy consumption by 10 - 40% and represents a $64B total addressable market, but is presently prohibitively complex and labor intensive. Transparent, NUV solar cells will simplify smart glass/film adoption by obviating the need for external wiring, thereby catalyzing deployment of smart window technologies in existing buildings to increase energy efficiency and enhance occupant health and productivity. Similarly, IoT smart devices/sensors promise to make the built environment more efficient by giving users more control over appliances, information, and energy use. Transparent NUV solar cells can provide point-of-use power to in-window IoT devices/sensors without altering aesthetics. For the photovoltaic community, the operation physics and performance of the NUV photovoltaic technology developed through this program will be of broader interest, as NUV wavelengths are inefficiently harvested by conventional photovoltaics.

The proposed project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows monolithically without competing for visible or near-infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate or imposing design constraints on window aesthetics. First-generation NUV solar cells exhibit power scalability with area, and single-junction photovoltages exceeding 1.6 V (record for thin-film PV). This Phase I project aims to (1) translate NUV solar technology from rigid glass to a flexible substrate, and (2) demonstrate use of low-cost transparent electrode alternatives. These breakthroughs will allow for facile integration of NUV solar cells with smart windows for self-powered operation and intelligent management of the solar spectrum, with NUV photons powering the regulation of visible and near-infrared photons for natural lighting and heating purposes, respectively. Additionally, the aesthetically-discreet nature of flexible, transparent NUV solar cells can enable remotely-powered internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices/sensors. Accordingly, funding for this Phase I project will produce a flexible, transparent NUV solar cell prototype for field-testing with smart window and IoT device technologies.

Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will extend and enhance human lives.   

This SBIR Phase II project will develop a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification, and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.

"abstractText": "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed, labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously, wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.  With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically, wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental conditions for the general public.     

The key outcome of Phase I research was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate, each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future, this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time process control in a variety of industrial applications."

The customized application will introduce a more computationally-efficient alternative to SCAL and digital rock technology field (i.e. combined physics-based and imaging paradigm) and will accelerate the forecasting process of rock properties. Initially, users will be able to calculate one of the most critical properties of the reservoir rock, i.e. permeability. Customizing machine learning algorithms developed in Phase I for rock permeability estimation to other industries will facilitate entering into other markets.

In order to maximize yields while simultaneously minimizing irrigation water usage, farmers need to understand, predict, and manage plant water stress, which is the yield reducing stress plants undergo when they struggle to draw water from the soil.  If successful, this project will demonstrate to farmers that low-cost measurement and forecasting of plant water stress is possible, and that Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendations for irrigation scheduling reduce water and energy usage, eliminate plant water stress, and increase crop yields.  Research and Development activities completed will enhance the understanding of the relationship of plant water stress to microenvironmental conditions and how plant water stress and microenvironmental conditions can be accurately measured and forecast with low cost sensing capabilities.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to perform research and development to validate the concept of a low-cost synthetic sensor for plant water stress.  The objective of this project is to field test the low-cost sensor arrays, compare the output to data from high-cost scientific grade sensors, and utilize the data gathered during the field test to train ML models. These ML models will perform sensor fusion on the data from the low-cost sensor arrays and output a plant water stress measurement.  These ML models can then forecast future plant water stress, which will be compared to actual field measurements for accuracy assessment and refinement.  Once refined, the ML models will determine the minimal amount of irrigation water necessary to mitigate the predicted plant water stress.  This optimized amount of irrigation water will be allocated into a recommend irrigation schedule for farmers to review and implement.  The relevance and ease of use of the recommended irrigation schedule will then be assessed by farmers.

While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

"abstractText": "This program promotes international multidisciplinary research opportunities for U.S. students at the overlap of sustainability, power systems and signal processing with the aim of improving efficiency in PV power generation. Algorithms for shading prediction and fault optimization will advance the state of the art in remote solar array management.  Training students in machine learning, vision and data processing for energy systems is unique and requires an integrative approach.  IRES participants will be immersed in producing and understanding solar analytics and creating algorithms and software to control solar arrays. The IRES program will engage faculty researchers from the Arizona State University SenSIP center and from the University of Cyprus KIOS Center in solar energy research. Programs and workshops will be established so that IRES participants are trained in machine learning for energy systems and present their research results in international settings. Weekly presentations at the international site and guidance by international mentors will enrich the cohort research experience. Embedding students in the KIOS center research labs funded by large European Union (EU) grants will provide knowledge on EU and international research practices, energy standards and policies. Students will spend six summer weeks at the University of Cyprus KIOS center to improve their research skills and elevate their cultural competencies.  This international research endeavor will energize students to innovate and disseminate results globally. 

 Solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) arrays encounter loss of efficiency under conditions of shading, panel faults and temperature variations.  In fact, shading, weather patterns, soiling, and temperature reduce power output considerably. For example, a malfunction of one panel will cause an entire PV string to fail.  To minimize inefficiencies, individual panel current-voltage (I-V) measurements, weather information, and imaging data are essential. Controlling the power output is possible through solar panel matrix switching and optimization (i.e., changing certain array connections from series to parallel using actuators). Matrix switching using programmable relays allows for different interconnection options. The research goal is to optimize PV array systems by: a) exploiting the measured I-V patterns to detect faults using machine learning, b) employing advanced imaging and vision techniques to predict shading, c)  using temperature, irradiance  and weather data to elevate PV efficiency, and d) include smart grid interfaces.  This collaborative IRES project between Arizona State University and University of Cyprus will engage students in the following research problems: a) How do we use imaging to detect cloud movement, predict shading and elevate efficiency? b) How can the array connections be reconfigured based on imaging, weather, and I-V data to elevate efficiency? c) How can we detect and classify panel faults in real time using machine learning and other algorithms? d) How do we extend these solar monitoring and control concepts from utility-scale solar farms to house rooftop systems?

"abstractText": "Drylands (arid and semi-arid ecosystems) are of global ecological and socioeconomic importance as they cover nearly half of the earth's terrestrial surface and support a large and growing portion of the earth's human population and livestock production. Despite their importance, ecological processes in drylands are poorly understood relative to wetter systems. This lack of knowledge limits available information for informed dryland management. The project aims to address this knowledge gap by training US undergraduate and graduate students to carry out international research in dryland ecosystems. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity will provide intensive training for eighteen US students over a three year period. The student activities will last for eight weeks each summer, during which students will conduct research at the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre, located in the heart of the oldest desert in the world, the Namib Desert of Namibia. US students will work collaboratively with Namibian interns, Namibian mentors, and US PIs to design and carry out novel research projects that will use a unique precipitation gradient to explore how climate and soil composition affect ecological processes in drylands. Students will prepare for the research experience through an online seminar in the semester before travel and will participate in follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following their research experience. These research projects will train a cohort of US students in research techniques, positioning them for careers that will advance our understanding of dryland ecosystems. The use of research teams composed of US students, Namibian interns, and Namibian faculty mentors will provide valuable training in collaborative research and communication skills. This program will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged dryland scientists, thus enhancing capacities and contributing to the ecological knowledge base, paramount for sustainable use and management of drylands. 

Scientific understanding of ecological processes in dryland systems is limited relative to wetter systems. This knowledge gap reflects both historical research biases and the transmission of these biases to successive generations of student scientists. Little scientific study of drylands is amplified by the fact that vast areas of global drylands are located in developing nations with limited scientific resources. A step toward enhancing our basic and applied knowledge in drylands is providing training opportunities for students in international dryland research and developing a next generation of scientific leaders who can effectively collaborate in international arenas. Increased leadership by US scientists in international dryland research will enhance understanding of our own drylands and improve basic science and land management in developing nations. The Namib Desert of Namibia offers a unique natural experiment for quantifying mechanistic controls over biogeochemical, ecological, and physiological processes in drylands because of a steep precipitation gradient coincides with contrasting soil surfaces. The close geographic proximity of sites with contrasting rainfall and soil types, access to a well-equipped research station, and existing relationships with Namibian scientists make this an excellent site for a research training program that will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged dryland scientists. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity (GDC-GRO) will facilitate research projects which will be carried out by teams of US students (undergraduate and graduate) and Namibian interns who will work closely with Namibian mentors and US PIs. A total of eighteen US students will participate (four undergraduates and two graduate students in each of the three years). Intensive IRES activities will last eight weeks each year, with preparation activities in the semester beforehand through an online seminar and follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following the IRES experience. Key players in this proposal are Namibian mentors (from University of Namibia, Namibia University of Science and Technology and Gobabeb Research and Training Centre) who are eager to work with student teams and US PIs to develop substantive research projects across the Namib precipitation gradient.

Three UREx IRES undergraduate students will also gain research experience in a foreign country, learn about the process of science through not only conducting their own research project but working closely with graduate students conducting research, and gain skills in research design, data analysis and management, and presentation. This experience will help all of these students learn to work across diverse social and political cultures so that they might be more effective. The students who participate in this program will share their experiences with others in the UREx program through a reading group, blogs, and social media and at a capstone symposium to be organized in 2020 by UREx fellows.


Technical description: Cities are highly vulnerable to extreme, weather-related events, given their location along coastlines and in drylands. As urbanization continues as the main demographic trend worldwide, an ever-greater proportion of the population is exposed to hazard. Little research has been done on Latin American cities, where strategies to enhance their resilience in the face of such events may differ from US cities owing to cultural, political, or biophysical differences. The UREx SRN is a multi-city network of scientists and local practitioners, including Latin American cities, which studies, envisions, and develops innovative solutions to the challenges of these extreme events. Linked to the UREx SRN, the UREx IRES program will train students in working across cultures and disciplines and with local decision-makers. Mentors at the host institutions are collaborators in the UREx SRN and are conducting urban resilience research in these cities. The UREx IRES will afford opportunities for nine UREx fellows to expand their dissertation research into these Latin American cities, enabling projects that can be used to compare resilient solutions between US and Latin American cities. Three UREx IRES undergraduates will be selected to work on research projects in close collaboration with the graduate students, supervised by host mentors. The students' creativity is emphasized: as part of the UREx SRN they will have had experience with interdisciplinary research, training on Latin American cities, and will write a short research proposal that explains how their IRES project will integrate with their dissertation research and contribute to the overall knowledge-to-action efforts in the host city. UREx IRES fellows will be conducting transdisciplinary research with practitioners and host mentors that will advance basic scientific understanding of the characteristics of urban areas in general and infrastructure in particular that will lead to more resilient, and ultimately sustainable, cities in the future."

"abstractText": "Norms of transparency and knowledge sharing in science encourage new research to build on prior discoveries, leading to rapid innovation and significant societal returns. This project establishes a new activity to help make scientific computation and data science more transparent and accessible. Computation has evolved from tools for assisting scientific research to digital laboratories where fundamental scientific discoveries take place. This is increasingly so for social and ecological sciences, which are combining big data with computational models to better understand the social and earth systems whose complex dynamics underlie many of the grand challenges faced by humanity today. Organized as a Spoke in the National Science Foundation's Big Data Innovation Hub and Spoke network, this project establishes a next generation, online Computational Model Library (CMLX). 

In the CMLX, software code for computational models used in social and ecological sciences is published and freely accessible to the scientific community and general public, and linked with an online database of scientific papers reporting on associated model-based science. In addition to the code library, the CMLX is developing an online repository to archive end-to-end workflows of model-based science, where the entire research process can be followed and reproduced, from data synthesis, to modeling, analysis, and visualization. A regional Working Group - including software developers, data providers, and user communities - will provide advice and expertise, as well as help establish community-wide standards for transparency and accessibility in scientific computation. The CMLX is enabling transparent access to scientific procedures, models, and data that can be used to assess the consequences of alternative scenarios, policies, and assumptions for more sustainable management of complexly coupled human and earth systems."

"abstractText": "The MetroInsight project is building an end to end system for knowledge discovery from real-time data streams collected through a variety of sensors, data collection and aggregation methods.  These data streams are highly dimensional with multiple sensors observing same or similar phenomena over multiple sensory spectrums and scales. These are also sometimes real-time and/or have strong timing relationships that is necessary to support metropolitan infrastructure through effective analytics and policy support. The project brings together a diverse number of partners utilities, universities, companies and cities with the ability to contribute novel tools and urban sensor data and to translate knowledge into actions. MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations."

This proposal plans to carry out low-frequency radio measurements of cosmic magnetism through a collaboration between Arizona State University and the German Long Wavelength Consortium. Each year, the program will fund two first-year graduate students and five advanced undergraduates, who will carry out research with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new European radio telescope. Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage, LOFAR will allow for intergalactic magnetic field measurements orders of magnitude better than previously possible.

Part 2
Magnetic fields thread the Universe, setting the criteria for star formation in galaxies, controlling the evolution of galaxy clusters, and altering the intergalactic medium from which all galaxies formed. Yet very little is known about their properties.
LOFAR is the first of a new generation of telescopes that operates in the extremely low frequency range between 10 and 240 MHz. Magnetic fields are primarily detected by their interactions with cosmic rays, and only telescopes at these low frequencies, which
correspond to low cosmic ray energies, are able to make sensitive measurements far away from cosmic ray sources and out in the depths of intergalactic space. With this remarkable new tool, the projects carried out by IRES students will help to open a new window on the magnetic universe. On galaxy scales, they will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster scales, they will probe the unknown physics of the hot
intracluster medium and the evolution of the synchrotron emitting bubbles found within it. On cosmic scales they will uncover the magnetic properties of the web of gas that connects all galaxies. Together they will be filling in a key piece of the fundamental question: what is the structure of the Universe on the largest scales?"

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology for plants, based on small naturally occurring molecules proven to activate natural defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed innovation as a plant protectant is active at very low concentrations (nM range), can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic. To feed a projected world population of over 9 billion people in 2050, innovation will be required at all stages of crop production and distribution. Annual application of more than 600 different chemical pesticides (500 million Kg) costs $10 billion, and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests (insects 13%, pathogens 12%, weeds 12%). By providing an alternative, effective method for managing transmissible diseases in major crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals such as copper, synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance development. The goal is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides, and significantly enhance food security worldwide. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small, naturally occurring molecules that elicit specific immune responses in plants. These small molecules are recognized by plants at extremely low concentrations, and their perception has been demonstrated to result in defense responses and enhanced resistance to viral, bacterial, oomycete, and fungal pathogens, in Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, barley, and wheat. In order to bring the innovation to market in the form of a commercial seed treatment, the following must be demonstrated: a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy, without adverse effect on seed germination or natural microbe/insect populations. The focus of the proposed Phase I project will be to optimize synthesis of the compound of interest and develop a stable, commercially viable formulation that is effective across a breadth of crops. Following initial validation, product testing will advance to in vivo efficacy testing in greenhouse and field trials. The seed treatment product developed will establish the technical and economic feasibility of using small-molecule signals to activate plant immune responses, and demonstrate their utility to improve economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion."

Currently capital equipment manufacturers are facing significant challenges in meeting the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors requirements for high volume manufacturing of integrated circuit chips.  This has caused severe ramifications to chipmakers on the success of next generation IC manufacturing and fabrication facility costs. Successful results from the work proposed would represent notable progress in high volume manufacturing using EUV capital equipment.

More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

First, by combining virtual assistants as facilitators, an integrated system of scaffolds through the Design Notebook, and support for collaborative interactions both within a learning environment as well as virtually, the platform has the potential to provide a self-contained, self-paced, stand-alone online platform focused on culturally- and socially-relevant game design that has the potential to expose and support hundreds of thousands of learners who do not currently have access to these types of opportunities, programs, or platforms within their communities in the United States.  Second, the platform has the potential to support global collaborations between groups of learners through its ability to showcase work and its virtual play-testing capabilities that will allow users to give and receive substantive feedback about the design of a game, and thus inform its iterative design, from anywhere.

This I-Corps project proposes a unique online platform with supporting scaffolds, that supports learners through game design for social change virtually in similar ways as the SCAT (Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking) project supported African-American middle-school girls face-to-face (DRK-12 #1150098).  SCAT and its scaffolds have been shown to be effective not only at helping African-American middle-school girls engage in Computing by designing games for social change, but also in improving their perceptions of themselves as critical thinkers and game designers with an intent to pursue game design or some STEM-related field as a result.  As such, the core technology of the platform is a stand-alone online platform that scaffolds learners through designing and implementing games (video or mobile) for social change as well as develops their computational algorithmic thinking capabilities.  It will be designed to leverage the affordances of the scaffolding in the SCAT Learning Environment including the facilitator, Design Notebook, and other Scholars.  The platform will contain several key integrated sub-tools that model and coach learners as they think through their designs, make connections, make design decisions, collect feedback to inform the iterative design of their games, ask questions of themselves and their peers, reflect on their experiences, and showcase what they have created.

Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

Capacitors are an essential component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines, appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors, large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions, is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. 

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size, poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly AC-Supercap technology.

This project will develop an innovative peer-assessment tool coupled with novel natural language processing methods producing accurate measurements of student ability to give and receive constructive feedback based on written feedback. The natural language processing methods will combine word vectors for efficient language processing, a generalizable neural net structure for sentence categorization outlined in existing research literature, and manually defined features based on existing peer feedback research. Research efforts will focus on gathering a large training dataset from partnering higher education classrooms, and iteratively refining a deep-learning natural language processing algorithm to achieve a target 90% accuracy. Automating this assessment process will allow broad and continuous assessment of student collaborative ability without requiring expensive and time-consuming retraining of the United States instructor workforce.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to help wastewater treatment plants become compliant with emerging environmental regulations, while saving energy and without adding cost.  It has potential to reduce the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site and landfilled by up to 85% as well as completely destroy odors and pathogens.  As a result, the project may also enhance social justice throughout the country.  Currently, low-income and disadvantaged communities inherit waste from other communities, sometimes very far away from where the waste originated.  They inherit the stench, the vectors (rats, flies, birds) and toxins.  For example, 7% of the biosolids produced by New York City end up in Alabama, via trains and trucks.  People living near the landfills and along transportation routes no longer use their porch because of the stench.  By improving the economics of a technology that destroys organics much better than state-of-the-art technologies, wastewater treatment plants will become cleaner, less malodorous and use less energy.  Other markets could open as well including clean power and chemical manufacturing. Finally, the project may lead to increased hiring of employees over the next three years. 

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an affordable and reliable process to cleanly and completely destroy organic waste, extract more resources and energy from sludge and biosolids at wastewater treatment plants while considerably reducing the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site for disposal.  This objective will be achieved by improving a process that uses water contained within the waste to create a hyper oxidative environment.  Similar processes use costly and hazardous pure oxygen, are extremely energy intensive, and are plagued with high maintenance cost.  By making innovations in energy recovery, the use of air as an oxidant instead of oxygen is possible without the large cost associated with having to heat and compress an entire air stream- oxygen plus inert nitrogen. Once optimal technical conditions for energy recovery are identified, the project will enter the design and fabrication phases. The resulting new energy recovery module will be added to an existing system. The prototype will be tested for continuous operation. New insights into energy recovery will be gained, which will benefit the scientific community as a whole.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide access to a solar heat source for controlled high temperature applications using minimal, low-cost equipment. The proposed Solar Concentrator Unit (SCU) is the first step to providing individuals and underserved communities with the freedom of a low-cost alternative to many of their most pressing manufacturing and materials processing needs. The SCU produces no emissions in its heat generation, requires no fuel costs, and can be used in remote locations to deliver precision control to high temperature thermal processes. Many new applications become available to market participants through the proposed innovation with the most notable commercial outcome being a multi-material additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) system capable of producing custom metal and glass parts. Additional applications for the SCU include welding; recycling of waste material into useful feedstocks; pyrolysis of waste streams to render them chemically and biologically inert; sanitizing medical equipment in disaster response operations; and very high temperature materials science research by individuals and research institutions.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the design and performance of a SCU for delivering high temperatures in the range of 65 ?C to 2,200 ?C over long durations (6+ hours). The technology relies on concentrated solar energy as the primary heat source with the proposed innovation being a feedback control system for maintaining temperature of a receiver plane to within +/-5% of an operating value. The proposed innovation addresses the limitations of existing methods for concentrating solar energy which lack temperature control and whose consistency of output thermal flux varies with time of day, sun position, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. This Phase I project will consist of development of a SCU prototype to conduct characterization tests on output solar flux and flux density under varying solar conditions. The expected outcome of this project will be to prove feasibility of the proposed design concept and evaluate its use for controlled, high temperature applications. The performance characteristics of the SCU will be fully explored in Phase I and the design of the SCU will allow for development of modular Thermal Processing Units in Phase II to interface with the concentrated solar spot produced by the SCU.

The SIMuR project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research of historical and ongoing human-environmental interactions in the Shiraki Plateau in the southeastern part of the country of Georgia. The project will strengthen scientific knowledge, technical and leadership skills of a cohort of diverse, globally competent, and engaged young STEM researchers. This international research experience will embed students in a cross-country and cross-disciplinary research effort while getting them acquainted with the national specifics of this culturally-rich strategic region. SIMuR will increase STEM engagement and literacy in underserved communities in rural Georgia and the US, bringing advanced data science, visualization and spatial and temporal analysis concepts and technologies into this cross-country collaboration, thus improving the capacity of students and universities to address research problems of global significance.

Specifically, understanding the interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors in the history of human settlement on the Shiraki Plateau is a part of the interdisciplinary challenge of identifying and modeling impacts of human and environmental changes influencing the rise and decline of civilizations. With the goal of contributing to this developing body of knowledge, SIMuR will engage 15 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University (5 students each year) in high-quality interdisciplinary research collaborations with Georgian peers and mentorship from an international group of experts in geological sciences, cyber-archaeology, computer engineering, information management, and data science. Participants will also engage in STEM outreach to underserved communities in southeastern Georgia and Massachusetts. Both the research and educational components of the project will build on a confluence of advanced technologies to clarify the several competing hypotheses of the depopulation of the Shiraki Plateau, the site of a recently discovered early civilization. The active reconsideration of the early human history of this area by the research community, and rapidly growing additional data from archaeological excavations and field observations in geology, hydrology, paleo-ecology and related fields, will make this an unprecedented opportunity for students to engage in the science debate, develop field research and analysis skills, and deepen their understanding of this rapidly developing culturally diverse area. By creating and disseminating findings in accessible online locations, the project will increase equitable access to authentic scientific data to scientists, educators, and underserved communities in US and throughout the world. Recruitment will focus on undergraduate students from groups traditionally underserved in STEM fields, low-income and first-generation college students.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.  Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  

The intellectual merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11 more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.  It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11 can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

A frequency domain THz spectrometer is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample. Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local environment. 

The proposed project will produce the first article of a compact, battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly from economical off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly compact, light&#8208;weight form factor. In order to achieve the high sensitivities, the spectroscopic THz sensor will incorporate: high fidelity lasers from the telecommunications industry, custom designed and fabricated high efficiency, hermetically sealed photomixers, a folded, light&#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&#8208;modulation technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument, a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work. Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin simultaneously.

Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity."

STEM fields are widely regarded as vital to a nation's economy, but a disconnect exists between the STEM knowledge and skills that students acquire in schools and those that they need to succeed in an increasingly global, technology-dependent workplace. Phase II research will enable development and testing of a video and peer review tool that will merge the core inquiry steps of successful scientists with state-of-the-art video proprietary technology, and allow collaboration between students and teachers located anywhere in the country. Commercialization of this technology will provide school districts with a needed educational tool to help teachers direct and assess STEM activities, and support students as they learn critical thinking skills and master STEM concepts, a mastery fundamental to successful careers in science and engineering. Encouraging the growth of students' STEM competency through this technology will encourage the growth of scientific innovations of the future, supporting domestic jobs and a strong financial tax foundation for our country's economic prosperity. 

The technical innovation in this SBIR project is an educational video software platform designed as a framework for STEM critical science inquiry, incorporating proprietary source code, student peer review, teacher assessment, analytics, a searchable database, and secure class-to-class video sharing. Each project requires that students work within a framework mirroring the best practices of professional scientists: Students organize concepts in terms of hypotheses, evidence, and analysis, and communicate their evidence-based projects to be peer reviewed. The secure video software platform is designed to be used within high schools and integrated into teachers' existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) to assess student progress. The goals and scope of the research are to develop the interactive video player source code that supports the educational framework and then demonstrate the results of this platform on student achievement utilizing a standardized achievement test.  These goals will be accomplished through several tasks focused on software development to incorporate secure account creation, peer-review interactivity, and LMS integration, followed by demonstration of class-to-class connectivity of the platform. A pilot study will assess the software platform?s functionality and validate its potential to significantly increase high school student critical thinking and scientific inquiry measures on a standardized test."

Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

Photovoltaics (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished, necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability of the material during operation. 

The technological feasibility of the copper pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials. Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers, our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products. Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure), is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&D must solve some core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems, optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1 of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed. For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost of production and control the cost of future facilities.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, if successful, will be the implementation of an effective point-of-care (POC) test that will not only impact the lives of patients, but can reduce the costs to hospitals, health insurances companies, and government agencies. According to the National Institutes of Health, cancer cost the U.S. an estimated $219 billion in 2007, including $130 billion for lost productivity and $89 billion in direct medical costs. The proposed screening technology is expected to help gynecologists in hospitals or in private practice to provide a complete diagnosis in less time, reducing the number of visits and the endometrial cancer incidence through an early detection, especially in women over 50 years old. This would benefit the medical insurance by lowering the cost per patient with this type of cancer. If successful, the proposed non-label/real-time cancer diagnostic device will contribute to new scientific findings and engineering aspects in bio-sensing technology. The resulting device will also provide a non-invasive, fast, and accurate method to detect cancer for preclinical diagnosis. In addition, the research based on this technology will improve a range of equivalent studies that use similar systems and biological indicators. 


The proposed project is aimed to develop a POC technology for the sensitive detection of telomerase as a cancer measurable indicator in real-time. Telomerase is a distinctive enzyme whose presence in cells or tissues is used for screening, early cancer detection, prognosis and/or monitoring a residual cancer disease. The proposed technology is based on the detection of telomerase in cancer cells through the measuring of an in-situ elongation process of an immobilized label-free single strand DNA probe by means of sensitive electrochemical events occurring at the conductive gold microchip surface. For the development of this new sensing microchip device the team will use commercially available products. Silicon wafers have been used as substrate with gold as electrodes due to their reliability but these materials are expensive and the fabrication is labor intensive. Therefore, important diagnostic device parameters will be studied after incorporation of bare bio-sensing strips. Phase I of this project, is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed technology as well as testing the reliability and robustness of the microchip biosensor using uterine cancer samples."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field."

Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable electronic patch for pregnancy monitoring in both clinical and home environments. Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers and insurance companies. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments. The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology, proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram, the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs, new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls. Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability, and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications, such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic dredging and excavation."

From a societal and economic standpoint, it contributes to addressing the national need for increased automation in multiple application domains, including advanced manufacturing, agriculture such as fruit picking, as well as rehabilitation and elderly care of an aging population in the US. The soft grasping approach proposed to be commercialized here is based on a recently patented dynamically tunable reversible dry adhesion technology, which can help resolve pain points in electronics assembly and advanced manufacturing processes such as irregular-shaped parts manipulation on automotive assembly lines. The commercialization potential is estimated to be on the order of one billion dollars. From an educational standpoint, this project not only helps train the senior personnel on the project about entrepreneurship, but also helps instill entrepreneurship principles and practices among students and researchers. 

This I-Corps project aims to identify the technical challenges faced by the industry on robotic gripping systems, which could help formulate ensuing application-driven fundamental problems pertaining to soft grasping. Soft grasping of objects with various shapes and stiffness has been a longstanding challenge in the robotics field. The approach proposed here is a spinoff of an ongoing NSF project, where novel smart materials and adhesion mechanics are integrated to realize a "core-shell" composite structure featured with dynamically tunable reversible dry adhesion. By modulating the stiffness of the "core" made of smart materials, the manner in which force is distributed to the interface between the composite and the adhered object is altered, and as a result, the effective adhesion strength of the adhered interface is changed.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings."

"abstractText": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project are as follows: Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a method for obtaining 3D structures of biological molecules. The method has growing importance in basic life science research and in the pharmaceutical sector for defining how drugs interact with their targets. Cryo-EM as a whole has matured into a powerful tool in recent years, culminating in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but the process of protein 'sample preparation' for 3D study has not advanced appreciably and is widely considered to represent the major bottleneck in the overall method. This bottleneck also presents a major commercial opportunity. The present project advances new nanofluidic-based technology aimed at addressing this bottleneck. Successful development of this technology will yield a consumable product ready for commercialization. Fulfillment of this goal will greatly advance and open new possibilities in cryo-EM structure determination. The resulting acceleration and enhancement of basic science and drug discovery would translate to broad societal benefit.

This I-Corps project advances a new technology, supported by prototype data, to breach the major bottleneck in the rapidly growing cryo-EM field, with broad impact in life science and drug discovery. Cryo-EM is performed by taking images of frozen proteins using an electron microscope, then processing the images with a computer to obtain a 3D protein structure. To image and obtain a structure, the protein sample must first be frozen into a thin layer (~50-200 nm). With existing technology, this process is poorly controlled, lacks reproducibility and substantially adds to the time required to get a structure. Our device is designed to directly mitigate these sample preparation problems. It is a self-contained, freezable fluid cell nanofabricated to specification, giving full control over sample geometry and protein environment. Protein is passively loaded into the fluid cell, the loaded device is frozen, and can then be imaged directly. Materials on the top and bottom of the fluid cell are selected to transmit the electron beam through the protein sample with minimal noise. Successful prototype testing and data collection has shown the viability of the core design, with future work focused on refining the design and materials and streamlining manufacturing for eventual commercialization.

This project, from Brigham Young University, creates an I-Corps Site.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

A typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Brigham Young University I-Corps Site serves students and faculty members by providing funds to encourage greater technology commercialization activity. Through this project, the BYU I-Corps Site brings together and builds on successful programs in three diverse colleges and two major entrepreneurial units at BYU: the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology (CET), and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO). The CET primarily addresses student entrepreneurship and the TTO primarily addresses faculty technology commercialization needs. 

By providing specifically targeted commercialization funds, this I-Corps Site program builds bridges that attract and stimulate both faculty and student entrepreneurial activity. Approximately 30 teams each year receive I-Corps funds to explore technology commercialization opportunities at BYU. Expected outcomes include  (1) formation of startup ventures with students as major players, (2) creation of scaling plans suitable for presentation to seed-stage investors, (3) increased participation by BYU students in the commercialization of faculty-generated IP, and (4) increased participation of women and underrepresented participants in BYU student entrepreneurship activities.  

Broader Impacts:
This program advances knowledge by studying best practices in university-centered technology commercialization processes, learning how to better incentivize students and faculty at BYU to participate in these processes, and tracking weaknesses in student teams to learn how best to blend student energy and creativity with faculty expertise and external mentoring. By engaging student teams in the technology commercialization process, so they build scalable new ventures, this program will directly create greater economic activity, particularly in the inter-mountain west region of the USA. This will result in increased job creation along with the other normal outcomes of increased economic activity. 

This program will also reach out to women and underrepresented participants, thus increasing the diversity of students involved in entrepreneurial activities within the BYU ecosystem. As an I-Corps Site, the CET's synergistic activity of holding the annual International Business Model Competition will gain greater visibility and thus promote the overall goals of the I-Corps programs to inculcate customer development and related lean launch principles in young entrepreneurs across the country."

"abstractText": "This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides funding for 10-week summer research experiences in physical-layer security at the University of Coimbra in Portugal.   Over the three-year project duration, the three yearly unifying topics of student projects will be network protocols for secrecy, intentional jamming techniques for secrecy, and novel error-correcting codes for secrecy in wireless networks. Students will implement projects on a software radio platform where appropriate. The disseminated results will aid system designers in adding a completely new layer of security at the physical-layer of modern networks.

This project will increase the understanding of physical-layer security for communications in real-world sensor networks.  Over the three-year grant period, fifteen students (including at least twelve undergraduates) will conduct research in Coimbra, Portugal.  The Portuguese research mentors are experts in physical-layer security and coding theory. Stronger collaborations between the universities will develop, leading to advanced results in physical-layer security. The research results may alter secure system design across many platforms to produce modern data security solutions. Recruitment of student participants will be performed at several diverse institutions throughout Southern Colorado, and will allow the development of effective mechanisms for attracting underrepresented groups to STEM research."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured, there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood, and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins, ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes. 

The proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique. This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate. Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time, supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

"abstractText": "Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (requiring e.g., the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained."

It will accelerate the adoption of next generation integrated circuit chips and bring significant benefit to society through the development of high performance electronics. Driven by portable devices in the mobile internet industry and the cost reduction requirements in Internet of Things (IOT), integrated circuit chips are becoming thinner and more flexible, whereas the working environments expose them to more extreme conditions. This trend creates increasing challenges and reducing reliability due to their higher inclination to failure. This proposed novel opto-mechanical system is able to identify early indications of potential problems. It can accelerate the recent industrial trends moving toward IOT and autonomous vehicle by significantly reducing development cycle time and engineering labor.  

These emerging industrial trends have induced many mechanical reliability issues, and are making it difficult to meet required quality and reliability of semiconductor devices. Many of these issues could be anticipated in integrated circuit design and on production lines with an instrument capable of measuring the sensitivity at the micron level. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a system for noncontact detection of premature failure. An imaging approach and stereo cameras are used to measure and track the sample. The anticipated result is to develop an instrument with ten-fold performance improvement over instruments currently available.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project advances a novel medical optical spectroscopy device to facilitate accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections.  The device uses a custom multi-LED microchip and photodetectors to illuminate the middle ear and collect reflected light in a familiar otoscope form-factor.   Reflected light signatures are analyzed to determine the presence or absence of middle ear fluid - a hallmark of middle ear infection.  The focus is to optimize product design and algorithm to enable gold standard accuracy across thousands of mass manufactured devices and millions of patients.  The device will be a cost effective means to achieving improved ear infection diagnosis in primary care where it is most needed.  Roughly 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5 and misdiagnosis of suspected ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary pediatric antibiotic use in the US.  Collectively, ear infection results in at least $5B direct healthcare costs annually in the US and billions more in lost parent productivity.  Improving ear infection diagnosis has the potential to eliminate millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions - a crucial step in mitigating development of resistant microorganisms.  Addressing this challenge requires a product that is cost-effective and consistently accurate.

This project will enable the first commercially available optical spectroscopy product for middle ear effusion and the only known method capable of accurately assessing ear health in very waxy ears.  Although optical spectroscopy as a scientific method is widely practiced, comparatively few commercial medical products exist.  High-cost, bulky spectrometer units are a primary limitation restricting development of products tailored to primary care and other low margin medical specialties where there is great need.  The proposed work enables cost-effective manufacture and deployment of the proposed device for ear infection and will be a platform for other next-generation, LED-based optical spectroscopy medical devices.  The investigators will develop an algorithmic scheme to correct variability in mass manufactured LED and photodiode components and design and construct test systems to automatically apply corrections to each completed medical device assembly.  The resultant methods and systems will enable deployment of medical optical spectroscopy systems at up to 100X lower unit cost as compared to spectrometer based systems.  The resultant device for ear infection will enable clinicians to more easily adhere to American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treating ear infections in primary care where there is greatest need.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets."

After school help has historically been delivered by tutors and homework hotlines but those avenues have been proven to be inadequate in closing learning gaps for students after they exit the classroom. The proposed technology is expected to further democratize homework and studying help. Being peer to peer, the proposed technology can radically shrink the cost of personalized homework and studying help for students at their own time and pace - especially the ones from economically or socially more challenged backgrounds. The project will also explore use of an innovative business model to optimize commercial viability with impacting a broad range of students irrespective of their backgrounds. It is expected that when fully developed, the technology would emerge as a scalable low-cost option to help improve student learning outcomes both nationally and globally.

The key intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a Smart Study Recommendations Engine. This involves harvesting the data from the class notes uploaded by students, analyze it to surface predictive insights and automatically deliver the notes or wide-ranging peer-reviewed study materials directly to the student users based on their learning styles, learning abilities, and learning gaps, without requiring them to perform a search. It will also provide them with an ability to connect them with peers who can provide additional support. Thus, this project seeks to provide personalized study playlists based on a student profile and pair them with a peer mentor who can provide deeper clarifications as required. The key outcome to be demonstrated is that 1 in 5 students engages favorably with the auto delivered math notes, helped by a peer who can provide clarity and tutoring as needed.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to address two conditions that are very prevalent in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single intraocular lens. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye to adjust focus, is expected to affect 1.37 billion people worldwide by 2020. Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision, is expected to affect 30.1 million Americans by 2020. Despite these ever-increasing numbers, there currently is no single product available that restores both visual acuity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract refractive surgery. Such a solution would provide a greatly improved quality of life for patients and would inform future scientific developments in human accommodation and cataract formation. Alongside improved quality of life, vision correction has the added benefit of increased productivity in the workforce. The cataract surgical and intraocular lens exchange markets are significant, with 25.5 million IOL implants and $3.3 billion in sales in 2016 worldwide. With the growing and aging population, these numbers are expected to increase at a rapid rate. This device will fill a significant unmet need and has the potential of restoring a range of vision unlike any device currently in the market. 

The proposed intraocular lens utilizes a highly sensitive refractive system leveraging large differences in refractive indices and has a mechanism of action unlike any currently in the market. It has the potential of levels of accommodation that are on par with accommodative abilities in a healthy, natural human lens. Forces in the eye are minimal, so this level of sensitivity is critical to any effective accommodating intraocular lens solution. Current devices and those in development do not exhibit the required level of sensitivity and subsequent accommodative amplitude to warrant significant adoption in the industry. Additionally, the proposed device shape mimics the natural lens, which allows for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye and prevents posterior capsular opacification. The first goal of this research will be the design and optimization of the lens utilizing a combination of mechanical and optical modeling. Lens prototypes will then be molded in a biocompatible, medical grade silicone. These prototypes will then be assessed for accommodative ability - first in an established opto-mechanical model eye experiment, then in an established human cadaver eye experiment. Finally, the prototypes will be assessed for injectability, to assure smooth integration with standard cataract surgical procedures.

While computers should, in principle, operate the same way each time, we have all seen how a program that ran fine yesterday somehow crashes today. Our current computing infrastructure betrays its fundamentally unrepeatable nature in a thousand careless ways, by letting processor and operating system details affect how programs run. Popular computing abstractions like containers and virtual machines improve repeatability, but do not provide any guarantees. This project conducts R&D on a new repeatable container, which provides repeatability for arbitrary programs running inside it. Repeatable containers will allow for reproducible software builds, software testing that runs the same on all machines, and faster software debugging with "one click" reproduction of failures. Repeatable containers reduce software development and QA costs. Repeatable containers can also facilitate archiving software and scientific research, and trustless grid computing.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of new container runtime systems that can enforce repeatability with low performance overhead. This project will focus on technical improvements that yield a robust container runtime which can handle a wide range of legacy software that collectively exercises the full range of processor and operating system behaviors. The container will integrate smoothly with both existing container technologies and existing container users, to facilitate easy adoption by software developers. Key technical results will include developing a "fingerprinting" technology to uniquely identify container executions, and a stress-testing methodology to increase confidence that the repeatability guarantee holds.

The DNA Barcode Scanner will enable anyone, anywhere, to perform a low-cost, rapid, automated DNA test to validate the identity of a tissue sample, without specialized training, expensive lab-based equipment, reagents, or reliable power, where it is needed most - in the field. This technological advance has the potential to revolutionize species identification to prevent species extinction, to protect consumers and our food supply, and to combat threats to global biodiversity. The innovation's commercial potential includes improving the safety and sustainability of our supply chains, combatting costly environmental fraud, and detecting pests and pathogens that threaten our nation's economy, security, and health. The initial market opportunity is to address unmet demand from seafood suppliers, distributors, and retailers; government regulators and enforcement agents; and conservation and natural resources entities, for increased transparency and integrity of seafood supply chains by ending seafood mislabeling and fraud, which occurs in over 30% the $17.1 billion dollar U.S. seafood market and is worth up to $250,000 per illegal import.

The proposed project will develop the customizable DNA collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge that enables a user to go from tissue sample to species identification in a single device. This project focuses on the scientific and technical challenge of automating sample preparation. The company's goal is to create an integrated device that will validate seafood products (our first market) from sample collection to DNA extraction, DNA amplification, and, ultimately, species identification. The goals of this project are to 1) determine a reliable and intuitive method for collecting DNA from a seafood product and create a prototype collection tool, 2) prototype an easy-to-use and highly flexible DNA extraction and sample preparation component to provide DNA suitable for analysis, and 3) fully integrate microfluidic processes and molecular chemistry (DNA amplification and analysis) with clear validation of multiple species. They will design and test several prototypes of the collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge and test these with users to identify the most robust and simplest method for delivering confident species identification. Their objective is to deliver a fully functional prototype that is intuitive for users and can perform a seafood species validation test in multiple field environments.

The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project."

If fully actualized, Coreshell?s coatings have the potential to revolutionize the LIB industry and enable widespread commercialization of clean energy technologies. 
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Coreshell?s unique electrode coating technology. The state-of-the-art electrode surface protection in LIBs is formed electrochemically and is termed ?SEI? (Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase). SEI is slow and expensive to make, inherently unstable, and consumes lithium thereby reducing capacity. This proposal is based on a novel proprietary coating in place of SEI, using a roll-to-roll process that can be seamlessly integrated into existing LIB manufacturing lines. By depositing well-formed coatings on the surface of battery electrodes, Coreshell?s technology can protect against many of the degrading reactions that occur during LIB cycling. The proposed technology has the promise to deliver greater initial capacity, greater depth-of-charge over equivalent cycle-life, reduced manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the potential to reduce LIB cost per kWh by up to 25%. In Phase I, Coreshell will demonstrate part of this value through two main objectives. The first is to increase initial battery capacity by >5% and retain the total capacity to >90% of original after 200 cycles. The second is to show that batteries incorporating Coreshell?s coated electrodes can eschew SEI formation, which would demonstrate the feasibility of ~7% reduction in manufacturing costs.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a unique cloud computing platform with a novel database and bioinformatic software package to address the strong demand for transformative foundational resources crucial to interpret the biological function of DNA variation sequestered within and between genomes. The goal is to target a broad scope of laboratories investigating human genomics and disease, comparative and evolutionary genomics, systems biology, animal health and veterinary sciences, and wildlife biodiversity and conservation. The product will offer opportunities to advance cross-disciplinary research to keep pace with the accelerating rate of DNA sequence variant discoveries driving the extraordinary growth of the genomics industry.  This vision is founded on the continued rapid growth projections (in billions of dollars) for the genomics market and the concomitant increase in the need for integrative tools and services.  The technology will allow customers to save time and research costs, experience substantial increases in efficiency and accuracy, and explore, in precise detail, complex gene networks and pathways.  

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to resolve a critical impasse in genomic workflow where inconsistent or unreliable identification of DNA variant function prevents actionable discoveries. Using the customized suite of bioinformatic tools provided by this technology development, the customer will be able to interrogate the database for any gene or gene system of interest, determine the normal range of DNA changes tolerated by the gene within functional space, and screen their own data against this baseline to identify variants causative in altered biological function and phenotypic traits. The research objectives include: Compiling proprietary and novel DNA sequences from thousands of genes, establishing and confirming the precise arrangement of these gene sequences guided by shared common ancestry to create the database framework, establishing a plan for product software and content to guide the user through proper use of the database and interpret variant function, and developing strategies to ensure product security and cloud-computing service data visualization and display to protect the processing of user data when passed within the software.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. 

The proposed project aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients. Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer. The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project (NSF Lineage: Award Number 1644664) is borne from the development of a customizable symptom management tool to support women experiencing menopause. The negative perception of menopause causes symptom embarrassment which leads to deficiencies in health literacy and inefficient symptom management.  This project's technology, a wearable-app system, addresses this inefficiency by providing the means to inform and support women throughout menopause. The proposed I-Corps program explores commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of menopause symptom management and also investigates the potential of applications in the cancer symptom management and data sales markets. With respect to the latter, the prospective technology will gather an abundance of data that may be used to streamline biotechnology and pharmaceutical product development. Through adoption of this technology, women will be able to better communicate their symptoms to a more aware and understanding society. This opens the door to future innovations in additional areas of healthcare that are traditionally not openly discussed.

This I-Corps project is based on the premise that leveraging personal mobile devices and user data may create disruptive innovation in the healthcare space. The project's technology utilizes multiple sensors to collect personalized data which is used to provide the user with multiple ways to optimize management of her menopause symptoms, with the goal of minimizing their negative impact on her daily routine. Progress on the project to date includes development of an alpha prototype that has been used to test the feasibility of both hardware and software components. Current areas of focus include optimization of the physical design and data acquisition capability. The I-Corps process will allow us to improve our understanding of our customers? unmet needs and the ability of our technology to address them. This will guide the development of our technology, including optimization for manufacturing and feature enhancement, to address needs found in customer discovery and accelerate introduction of a useful product to market.

The use of the tool will allow the inspection of human-built structures to be performed significantly faster, more thoroughly and at a lower cost by eliminating the need for scaffolding or blocking traffic. It will also improve inspection safety and speed which leads to more frequent and on-demand inspections, thus making the national infrastructure more secure.

This I-Corps project has the following innovations: 1) novel design of robotic inspection system carrying a RGB-depth camera to detect surface flaws, and a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor to detect sub-surface defects on both ground and vertical surfaces that other robots cannot do; 2) a novel method that enable the robot to scan the surface in an arbitrary trajectory with accurate positioning and integrate the control with GPR signal processing to identify areas of delamination and locate subsurface embedment (rebar, pipes, fractures, voids, delamination, etc.) in concrete structures that will revolutionize the way GPR data is interpreted and displayed. The value proposition of the robotic inspection system includes: 1) automating the vision/GPR data collection process with minimal human intervention; 2) simplifying the robot control to scan the surface in an arbitrary trajectory; 3) making inspection results easy to understand by non-professionals; 4) and improving the inspection speed and accuracy.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an extra layer of security protection for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by using a novel hardware-based intrusion detection system. In today's defense-in-depth security strategy, all available security controls are placed in series aiming to protect a device from malicious cyber-physical attack.  Market research estimates that the IoT market will reach over $500B by 2021 and security is considered one of the biggest barriers in adopting IoT.  One main reason of this security concern is due to the limited resource of IoT devices that makes it difficult to apply all layers of security protections. The adoption of the proposed approach will provide additive security layer to the IoT devices that will boost the confidence in IoT device security in cameras, drones, sensors and others. Consequently, it may induce new industries which have previously been reluctant to apply IoT solutions to their businesses. Due to the small resource occupation of the proposed device security, even non-IoT industries may apply the proposed approach to their security applications.

This I-Corps project applies Stochastic Computing (SC) to provide hardware Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) security solution for resource limited IoT devices. Current approaches to IoT security cannot provide HIDS solution to these resource constraint IoT devices, thereby missing out from one of the important layers in defense-in-depth security strategy. The proposed approach exploited two salient properties of SC: 1) consumption of less silicon area and power, 2) both SC and HIDS are inherently probabilistic in nature. SC is generated probabilistically from conventional number system that can perform complex mathematical operation using simple hardware blocks. The proposed approach provides IoT devices with HIDS based on simple hardware together with Machine Learning Neural Network Algorithm. Coupled with other security layers such as cryptography, access control etc., this light weight hardware solution provides strong security to the resource limited IoT devices. Embedded inside the IoT device, this HIDS monitors the incoming packets for any malicious activity and offers the last important layer of security defense.

Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.

The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion."

"abstractText": "This project focuses on women and minorities and approaches to increasing their representation in innovation, entrepreneurship, commercialization, and the lean-startup methodologies associated with NSF's Innovation Corps (I-Corps). The project consists of a national Summit for Broadening Participation (BP) and inclusiveness within the academic community that comprises the NSF National Innovation Network (NIN). This BP Summit initiative is motivated by several statistics: while Blacks comprise over 14% of the workforce in all private industries in the United States, they account for only 7.4% of the high-tech workforce, and people of color represent only 8% of US innovators. By contrast, whites account for nearly 64% of the workforce in all private U.S. industries, but over 68% of the high-tech workforce. Hispanic workers are also underrepresented, comprising just under 14% of jobs in all private U.S. industries, but less than 8% in high-tech industries, and women represent only 12% of US Innovators. 

The BP Summit for inclusiveness in innovation and entrepreneurship has several key objectives: provide participants with an understanding of how academic institutions and individuals can boot-strap themselves into the mainstream sphere of commercialization, particularly through the I-Corps programs; provide insights into the impacts that programs like I-Corps have had on individuals and institutions; connect champions at MSIs with existing I-Corps Nodes and Sites personnel; highlight winning strategies employed by individuals and institutions and outcomes of successful innovations; increase the participation of under-represented groups in I-Corps training at the local, regional, and national levels, both at the team and instructor levels; provide opportunities for networking and collaborations between attendees.

The Summit brings together representatives of: Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), I-Corps Node and Site personnel, researchers in the fields of inclusiveness and entrepreneurship, and, leadership from organizations serving the target population who can help innovation and entrepreneurship to their members such as the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the Association of Students of African Origin (ASAO), Women in Engineering ProActive Network (WEPAN), and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME).

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on the development of a lower-cost, improved performance infrared radiation detection technology.  Numerous technologies presently exist for detecting Infrared radiation.  Those which are cost effective for commercial applications tend to lack adequate performance specifications, while those with ideal performance are too expensive.  This technology has broad application potential.  The proposed I-Corps program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensing of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane and ethylene gas.  These sensors have significant markets related to smart ventilation systems for cars, homes, and businesses, as well as leak monitoring in industrial processes and oil and gas production.  Further enabling the mass deployment of these sensors will have significant impact on energy conservation, environmental protection, and health and safety.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may prove to be disruptive in thermal imaging applications.  Presently, thermal imaging applications are broad but the hardware is often too cumbersome and expensive to be practical for commercial use.

This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the intersection of different scientific disciplines leads to disruptive innovation.  The project's technology is a fundamentally different approach to infrared radiation detection than those developed in the past 50+ years.  This project pursues an optical solution to a semiconductor material processing problem which has hampered the realization of adequate production yield, manufacturing scalability, and device performance, resulting in too high a cost and limited suitability for many commercial applications.  Previous progress on this project has focused on the theoretical development of the optical design and experimental verification of these nanofabricated structures.  Initial results have been encouraging, and work continues to enhance responsivity, as well as other necessary device specifications.  This I-Corps process will be used to refine our understanding of customer problems/needs and the potential for our technology to solve them.  This will further inform our technology development path and specification focus, enabling the release of a useful product to market sooner.

The project goal is the development of an efficient and practical machine learning system for nutrient curation and management that may revolutionize commercial farming.  Current technologies on the market lack adequate performance specifications and are not cost effective for commercial applications.  As a result of changing climate conditions and economic factors, many farms struggle to maintain profitability due to new operational challenges and risks.  Worldwide, arable outdoor farmland is dramatically being reduced due to changing climate conditions.  The proposed I-Corps project will initially explore the warehouse farm sector that grows produce indoors close to the point where this produce is consumed.  Direct beneficiaries of this project include the US agriculture industry, as well as those responsible for national food security.  Development of technologies to assist new forms of farming are now required to ensure access to fresh and more nutritionally dense produce in the decades ahead. 

This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the rational addition of nutrients to hydroponic systems based on real time feedback optimizes plant growth.  The core technology includes an automated nutrient dosing and pH balancing system which collects data and acts on environmental data.  This system consists of a sensor module monitoring hydroponic nutrient reservoir conditions and pump modules, combined with a cloud based data storage and processing component that adjusts chemical conditions as needed.  The driving algorithms utilize analytical techniques that model nutrient factor usage and predicts their effects on cellular gene expression and overall plant health.  Together, the hardware and software components derive a variety of plant growth metrics that will form the basis for a larger framework of environmental controls to dictate optimal plant growth.

Based on scientific claims that nanoparticles are detrimental to an individuals health, regulatory agencies, companies, and the general public have become more vigilant in finding non-nano alternatives to materials and products that they have been using. In addition to providing a non-nano alternative to existing metal oxides used in many personal care products, this project also allows for more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and end products. Cost-effective synthetic methods will allow for these alternatives to be feasible replacements to formulators, toxicologists, and other people involved in the manufacturing decision-making process.

This synthesis relies on milder temperatures with only water-based precursors that are utilized to yield surfactant-free, morphologically identical, and non-nano zinc oxide particles. The same methodology can be use to yield metal-doped zinc oxide constructs with enhanced properties depending on the metal used. The eclectic nature and environmentally friendly qualities of the reactants make this one-pot synthesis a perfect candidate for an ecologically conscious alternative to the state-of-the-art zinc oxide synthesis.

The technology understands mission objectives (intent-driven), coordinates with others (collaborative autonomy) and is voice enabled (natural language conversational interface), allowing it to work well with both humans and machines. These and other features lend this technology to broad commercial applications, offering the best strategy to mitigate multiple disaster levels - at the district or provincial level by assessing strengths and vulnerabilities to various hazards; at the community level like search and rescue during a flood or fire; and at the household level like ambulatory drone service care for the aging.

This I-Corps project will be focused on translating scientific research to commercialization through lessons on the business model canvas and extensive customer discovery. Our research has involved hands-on technical experimentation using deep/machine learning software for prototype development and literature reviews on a variety of software capabilities. Using a camera with machine learning, we were able to identify a human with most of the body obscured. Hardware acts as transport for the optical and acoustical biosensor package which can take action autonomously by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies extending to: realtime onboard object detection capable of identifying a person in rubble, even when the person is partially obscured (Machine/Deep Learning/edge), offline cloud-enriched datasets for cloud-sourced analysis, voice recognition/conversational natural language processing/speech synthesis. Blockchain enabled autonomous swarm management technology on multiple robotic devices will enable multiple machine collaboration. All sensor data is time-stamped and stored in the cloud where the AI technologies are used to enrich the data. Enriched data is made available offline via the internet to thousands of volunteers for human review. Results from our research show that the technological capability exists, the software and hardware components combined meet a need established through our initial customer discovery.

This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.


Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.

More consistent real-time identification of overweight trucks could significantly decrease the tens of billions of dollars per year of roadway damage caused by these overweight trucks.  An additional benefit of the system is that it promises to provide a new tool to identify changes in the deformation response of bridges.  These changes will help to diagnose structural damage to bridges. 

This I-Corps project employs electro-optical technology to monitor the structural deformations of civil structures in real-time. The intent of this technology is to augment/replace existing systems that rely on load cells at weigh stations.  The technology measures the deformation of structures under dynamic loads with a passive camera system that can monitor the structure from a distance. The system uses off-the-shelf commercially available video cameras to monitor a specific target on a structure, such as a fastener, reflector, or structural feature. The real-time video is then processed using proprietary pixel manipulation algorithms to calculate sub-millimeter displacements and rotations in 3 axes. The information, when observed in real-time, as well as the data products generated from the archived data can be used to determine the performance of structures, the impacts of dynamic loading, and even the prediction of structural failures. The system can also be used to identify overweight trucks in order to enforce weight limits on roads and bridges. This system provides high bandwidth measurements while exposed to typical lighting condition dynamics or other ambient conditions. We have conducted real-world conditions tests on bridges and a building that validate the feasibility of the technology.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the stabilization of temperature-sensitive formulations. Temperature-sensitive formulations, such as protein drugs and vaccines, require costly cold-chains for the transportation and storage. This requirement not only poses significant costs and great quality challenges for these products, but also may not be fulfilled under extreme environments or in certain regions. This unmet need may consequently limit the use of life-saving drugs. Enabling transportation and/or storage outside cold chains will resolve these problems having significant commercial markets and benefits. 

This I-Corps project is focused on a technology towards thermally stable formulations. This innovative, multifunctional technology based on ice-binding polypeptide (IBP) platforms, in particular, applies  previously unaddressed roles of IBP in thermal stabilization and carbohydrate crystallization controls to enable the stabilization of heat sensitive formulations/products during transportation and storage. The IBP stabilization technology can efficiently stabilize temperature-sensitive proteins and formulations under a wide range of temperatures, which may eventually enable the transportation and storage of these formulations outside cold chains. The ultimate goal is to enable cold-chain free transportation and storage of temperature sensitive formulations/products using the IBP stabilization technology. Specifically, the goals in this NSF I-Corps project are to understand the market needs by extensive customer interviews, to identify ideal customers, and to develop IBP stabilization technology to fit the identified customers' needs.

"abstractText": "The project will create a partnership among California State University Los Angeles, City of Los Angeles (LA) GEOHub, Community Partners, and the Social Equity Engagement geo-Data Scholars (SEEDS) Program to  provide access to and greater utilization of the city's big data collection. The partnership will introduce GeoHub data as decision making tools to highly motivated, ethnically diverse, and civic-minded students and increase participation of citizens in using GeoHub data. The project activities will promote widespread access to and understanding of LA's open data portal among a broad cross-section of the population, especially groups that are traditionally disadvantaged and less likely to be digitally connected. It will provide training that will allow citizens and non-profits to become proficient in the use of big data, empower citizens so that they can see data-driven government in action and effectively participate in civic decision-making, and make local cities more livable and equitable for all. With citizen involvement, open data portals can become sustainable and independent of political changes in the local, state, or national governments.  

The City of Los Angeles will provide California State University Los Angeles, community partners, and non-profit organizations GeoHub accounts to access software and apps free of charge and train California State faculty members who will, in turn, train their students in GeoHub's data and visualization applications. The students will help Community Partners to train non-profit organizations to use GeoHib for all of their service needs. This approach will effectively reach large numbers of users and contributors in diversified communities. The project will produce course modules with GeoHub hands-on service learning activities in disciplines across humanities, social sciences, geosciences, political sciences, public health, and civil engineering. It will also generate data access and visualization manuals and support community-based research projects. The project plan aligns with the Western Big Data Hub big data education and literacy efforts and contributes to the Hub's cross-sector activities.

Students from a diverse regional population will be recruited as summer cohorts to participate in research projects with researchers from the Brazilian Science-Technology Corridor (Sao Paulo - Campinas - Sao Carlos).  The interest in analytical applications combining microfluidics and nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the last years. Considering these advances and their importance for future developments, this IRES program aims to provide the tools for students to develop the skills required to face an internationally-competitive job market linked to chemical analysis. This proposal aims to boost education and training in a creative, multidisciplinary, and culturally-rich environment.  A focus on minority recruiting, combined with the involvement of graduate students as mentors, will provide the support mechanisms required to expand and strengthen the pool of participants as well as the research experience. 
 
Recent developments in nanotechnology and microfluidics have allowed the understanding and rational utilization of a series of micro total analysis systems (uTAS). The existing links between these two fields have enabled crossing the traditional borders and the development of unique training opportunities for students in science and engineering tracks. Furthermore, the interest in analytical applications combining microfluidics and nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the last years. Although this integration has enhanced sensing, separation, and extraction procedures, the applicability of specific nanomaterials for chemical analysis depends mainly on the chemical composition, structure, size, morphology, and preparation method. Considering these characteristics and their importance for future developments, this IRES program aims to provide students an enriching research experience and link chemical properties with a real-world analytical problem."

Because CSU has very large minority and first-generation college student populations, student recruitment in this project will attract underrepresented as well as female students.  

The CSU students will validate the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations, improve ATLAS software packages, and work on searching for new physics from ATLAS data. On ATLAS detector upgrades, the students will work on the installation, operation, and data analysis of ATLAS pixel detector, and improving software packages in monitoring various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ), the students will install and test Fast Tracker (FTK) boards, improve and optimize FTK variable resolution patterns, and conduct offline and online testing of FTK performance. The students will also attend the renowned CERN Summer Student Lecture Series given by top physicists from all over the world. Upon returning to the US, student participants will give colloquia, seminars, and invited talks at CSU campuses, high schools, and local communities about their ATLAS research work and the CERN summer experience. Through the CSU Fresno PHYS 168S (?Physics Outreach?) course, the ATLAS students in PHYS 168S will visit at least two new K-12 classrooms each week to teach kinds about the CSU ATLAS and IRES programs and encourage them to pursue science. These outreach efforts will reach very large number of schools, their students and students? families in the Fresno and Central Valley area.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on the characteristics of the Augmented Reality WEarable Device (ARWED) for training of post-stroke patients, allowing, for example, the user to perceive an impaired arm as healthy. Preliminary training protocols, incorporated within the ARWED, make the system a reliable solution that is expected to be broadly utilized by medical professionals working in rehabilitation, sports therapy ,and convalescence. Although the ARWED has been developed mainly for the physical training of post-stroke patients, the project's explorations are expected to provide effective tools for the physical rehabilitation of patients with limb limitations at any scale -- ranging from individuals suffering partial loss of motor ability to those with severe limitations in mobility due to strokes, birth defects or accidents. Since observational learning may offer greater benefits regarding transfer to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), in comparison to robotic-based stroke training, the medical community would also benefit from the development of the ARWED. Insights into how training using technology may enhance the recovery of motor control in diverse populations while providing a novel intervention that may prove more effective than what is currently available. 

This I-Corps project centers on exploiting the link between action-observation and action execution in order to develop training protocols, based on observational learning techniques, to facilitate rehabilitation following a neurological disorder. Such a disorder may range from such catastrophic events as stroke or a spinal cord injury. Currently, there are limited systems that utilize virtual reality in the relearning of biological movements. The development of the ARWED required solving several challenges in computer vision, modeling, and robot motion. The current testing of the effectiveness of the device requires combined expertise from the areas of biomechanics, signal analysis, virtual reality, robotic fault recovery theory and rehabilitation. Therefore, the theoretical contributions emerging from this collaborative research is expected to advance knowledge and understanding not only within the medical field, but also across the above-mentioned research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will lead to the education of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of Engineering, Medicine and Kinesiology, among others. The outcomes of the project will facilitate a dialogue between Physical/Occupational Therapy and Engineering students and professionals that can aid in the human recovery following neurological disorders efforts.

Many of the California State University  and the University of California campuses in Southern California, where the U.S. students will be recruited, are Hispanic Serving Institutions and Minority Serving Institutions. The project will have societal benefits by promoting mutual understandings between the two nations.
 
The aim of the project is to give U.S. students international research experiences under the mentorship of a prominent Uzbek mathematician, Shavkat Ayupov, a well-known expert in Leibniz algebras. The PI will take three separate cohorts to Uzbekistan, 15 to 21 U.S. students over three years, to conduct research for two months at the Institute of Mathematics of the National University of Uzbekistan. The U.S. students will join Ayupov's research group and conduct research in collaboration with their Uzbek peers and mentors on topics of current interest in Leibniz algebras. Examples of research topics include studying properties of derivations of Leibniz algebras and identifying solvable rigid Leibniz algebras. The Leibniz algebras, which are generalizations of Lie algebras, are an important and rapidly developing area of mathematics with applications in general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory. It is expected for each research project to result in publications and lead to further research collaboration. In addition to their research activities, the students will also take short courses on the language, culture and traditions of Uzbekistan to help them adjust to their surroundings. During their stay in Uzbekistan, the U.S. students will travel to the ancient cities of Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva to learn about the cultural and scientific heritage of Uzbekistan."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.) add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by 2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.
  

The proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar, disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

"abstractText": "This project, from Carnegie Mellon University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

A primary goal of the CMU I-Corps Site is to build a comprehensive program that is adaptable to other universities and regions across the country; one that leverages and augments local resources and that integrates into the NSF I-Corps program. To this end, the CMU I-Corps Site works with a network of regional Sites and national Nodes to prepare teams to enter the National I-Corps training program. The CMU I-Corps Site model curriculum incorporates an agile methodology focused on customer discovery and product adaptation, and provides effective mentoring, strong collaborations with regional stakeholders, and the incorporation of programs and perspectives of regional partners. A goal is to create an entrepreneurial community of students, faculty and community members who not only benefit directly from the program, but also become experts in mentoring and advising others. 

The CMU I-Corps Site accelerates the effective transfer of university research into successful commercial ventures, enabling government funded university research and innovations to promote regional growth and benefit the public. Many sectors serve to gain, for example, healthcare, transportation, energy, and sustainability. Incorporating regional expertise and collaboration benefits both the university and the community and helps broaden participation. The program provides an adaptable model to strengthen the entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem of universities, their regions and the nation."

"abstractText": "The goal of the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) I-Corps Site, led by the campus-wide Carnegie Mellon Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), is to implement a systematic and replicable agile startup methodology, focused on customer discovery and product adaptation. 

The CMU I-Corps Site leverages Carnegie Mellon's strengths and past successes in fusing technology with entrepreneurship. Their Site utilizes CMU's network of internal and external contacts to train entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields. CMU's curricular model is based on the i6 Agile Innovation System and is consistent with the I-Corps Curriculum. It includes four elements: workshops, mentoring, funding for projects and customer discovery, and incubator space.

The objectives of the CMU Site are to: 
1) capitalize on CMU's culture of innovation by expanding programs to nurture entrepreneurial ventures and transition university research to the market; 
2) train individuals to understand basic motivations, processes, practices, and challenges of innovation and entrepreneurship;
3) hone individuals' entrepreneurial practices and skills; 
4) collaborate with industry, entrepreneurs, and the business community in the region and nation. 

The CMU program will recruit teams from: existing entrepreneurial activities, course projects, college liaisons, and an open call. Underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply. Teams will be encouraged to avail themselves of enrichment opportunities such as funding avenues, venture competitions, and business events. Each team will have an Entrepreneurial Lead, an Academic Lead, and a Mentor.  

The assessment plan focuses on ascertaining the most effective components of an agile university entrepreneurship training program. Teams' milestones and customer contacts will be tracked. Formative assessment using tools such as pre-, mid-, and post-program surveys will inform the CMU program evolution.

Of particular merit is this proposed Site's agile and adaptable customer-based training program, components of which have been shown to be successful in programs such as the i6 Agile Innovation System and the I-Corps Curriculum/Lean Launch Pad. Combining these components -- and then distilling through assessment and evaluation which of them are especially effective at spurring creativity, resourcefulness, independence, and connectivity -- will further entrepreneurial knowledge and education. The program will also teach entrepreneurial students and faculty how to create their own ecosystem by engaging in customer discovery and network building. 

The CMU I-Corps Site plans to move university research out of the lab more efficiently and effectively. Expediting the movement of academic innovation to the commercial sector allows new, often government-funded, university discoveries and inventions to reach the public sector earlier spawning new endeavors and economic growth. All sectors of society and areas of inquiry -- healthcare, energy, sustainability, global communication, for example, can see benefits. In addition, making earlier decisions about viability of commercial outcomes is beneficial as it can more effectively utilize critical resources --time, energy, talent, and funds. In addition, a successful Site will likely impact the Pittsburgh, Steel Valley, and Allegheny Valley communities."

The future electric power grid, commonly referred to as the smart grid, is expected to differ from the current system by the increased integration of distributed generation, demand response and sensing and communication technologies. As distributed energy resources become more prevalent and shape the future of the electric power grid, the overall operational flexibility of the grid increases.  This also means that more control decisions need to be made. This project provides an optimal coordination solution for coordinating geographically scattered energy resources. A commercially viable optimal coordination solution for ever increasing energy resources is crucial for cost efficient generation and dispatch of electricity and ensuring the reliability of the power grid. Specially, focusing on cold chain technologies, this project addresses scalable and flexible control and coordination of distributed refrigeration systems; it is envisioned that the proposed solution and software would turn end-users' pre-installed refrigerators and freezers into an integrated intelligent refrigeration system and significantly improve their energy efficiency.

This I-Corps project provides a novel distributed control method that addresses a significant operational challenge of the distribution electric grid. Control of energy systems today is largely performed by centralized computing and control solutions run at central units. Increased infeed measurements (sensing data) result in growing stress and extended time for computations. Thus, centralized control solutions may not be feasibly computed and applied in real-time. This project contributes to fundamentally new methodologies and software for distributed computation of control decisions in real-time. Our research provides a promising solution for the intelligent control of distributed energy resources, which enables the efficient interaction and coordination of a variety of components with and by a central unit. The key premise in this research is that if coordinated in an intelligent, predictive and scalable way, operation of numerous energy resources can be optimized in real-time, thereby resolving the issue of scalability. In addition to extending the proposed distributed control methodology toward achieving reliable and cost effective energy and demand side management, this project focuses on commercializing a more target specific extension of the proposed approach directed at minimizing the operational cost of refrigeration systems in cold chain industries through enhanced distributed coordination."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning."

"abstractText": "This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides a 12-week research experience at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland for fifteen Carroll University students. The goals of the project are twofold.  First, to develop students? cross-disciplinary scientific research skills by embedding them in projects and facilities that are not available at a small undergraduate institution.  To achieve this goal, each student will join a research group and project in the Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry at Strathcylde for a summer of research.  The second goal is to prepare students to thrive in an interdependent and multicultural scientific environment (and future career) by emphasizing the cultural aspects of the experience.  This program produces increased cross-cultural awareness and competence - derived from a pre-trip cultural competence course, cultural seminars overseas, and the experience of living and working in another culture for a summer. In order to support broader participation in this project, special effort is given to recruiting into the program students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  

The research that the students will undertake is cutting-edge and highly relevant to today?s world. While at Strathclyde, our students will carry out individual projects related to alternative energy technology, nanoscience and materials chemistry.  In particular, they will work on self-assembled organic photovoltaic materials, redox flow battery systems, and nanoparticle assemblies for healthcare diagnostics and therapy.  The students will benefit from working on some of the most advanced instrumentation available, while collaborating with researchers who are pre-eminent in their fields. All students will present their work at local and national meetings, and we expect that many of the students will also contribute to peer-reviewed publications, thus helping to disseminate their results to the broader scientific community."

Case Western Reserve University


This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program will provide an international research experience at the Lanzhou University in China for four students from the United States each year.   The intellectual merit of the work is to advance the scientific understanding of electrostatic charging in granular systems, both generally and specifically for the case of wind-blown dust.  Electrostatic charging of granular systems is ubiquitous and has important consequences in both industrial and natural processes, but is very poorly understood.  The impressive facilities at Lanzhou University, which include a wind-tunnel and a desert research station, offer a unique opportunity to carry out studies in a controlled but realistic environment and increase our understanding of particle charging in wind-blown systems. The broader impact of the program is to train US students in research with a global perspective; China is an ideal location for such a program, as the country has become a worldwide leader in industry, commerce and scientific research.  

The specific goals of the study will be to carry out measurements of particle fluxes, particle size distributions, and particle charge distributions as a function of elevation in wind-blown dust systems.  We will also measure electric fields as a function of elevation which will allow us to compare with previous studies, and correlate with particle flux, size and charging  On one hand, we aim to understand how these electrostatic effects vary with parameters such as wind speed, overall particle size distribution, and humidity, and on the other hand how the electrostatic effects arise in natural conditions and what their consequences may be on dust migration. Our strategy will be to: (a) develop and validate methodology in laboratory scale experiments; (b) carry out well-controlled large scale wind tunnel experiments, where wind speed and direction, as well as other relevant parameters (e.g., particle size distribution, humidity), can be controlled; and (c) carry out field experiments in the desert, where the conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity, etc.) are not controlled and will vary significantly during the course of the experimentation, but where the results are most meaningful in regard to environmental and climatic implications.  Students will work in interdisciplinary teams, serving in different roles throughout the project from designing experiments to carrying out field studies, and analyzing data."

This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

Today, a large segment of society identifies as being underrepresented in the technology sector. Some individuals experience low technology-related self-confidence as a result. At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs. When people see themselves as future practitioners of a technical skill, it is possible to learn topics in a deeper, more fulfilling, and more enduring manner. Commercializing this invention will increase online learning platform retention rates, driving revenue not only within educational companies but within the companies who hire the resulting talent.


The proposed technology is innovative because no commercially-available software tools exist which support metacognitive development in tandem with technical skill acquisition. This innovation is risky because no one has proven that having a positive influence on metacognition through automated software is even possible during single learning session. The goal of this research is to deliver techniques for enhancing the self-efficacy of STEM learners within the context of online learning platforms. The project combines best practices in digital personalization and educational psychology research to deliver customized content responsive to learner preferences and learner attitude attributes. The proposed research will demonstrate, via a random trial, increased levels of motivation and engagement in students who receive targeted interventions as compared with a control population. Using survey instruments, the researchers will measure changes in self-efficacy, challenge-seeking, and goal-setting behavior. Because the research team has unique experience in developing proven educational interventions which enhance self-efficacy across a variety of learning domains, the algorithms and methods inside the proposed technology will be difficult for competitors to replicate. This SBIR project will deliver algorithms and automated, web-based interventions to help all STEM learners experience personal engagement with STEM topics and find empowerment in the task of learning.

"abstractText": "SOBRE Mexico - Student Opportunities for Biological Research in Mexico 

This program will partner students from Central Washington University (CWU) with top scientists from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) to explore tropical dry forest ecology in a world-class biological field station in western Mexico. Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at Estación de Biología, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from México and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations. This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community. 

The Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance, SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response, and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases, such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows. The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data, and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach. However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader, expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics) to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote use in any environment.

There is a demand for such tools in inclusive and integrated K- 12 classrooms to cater to the needs of students with varying reading levels. This is especially pertinent to English language learners (Els), international students, and Special Education students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive impairments that impede their reading abilities. Existing tools offer one-size-fits-all solutions offering no control over the simplification process. The proposed Personalized Text Simplifier (PeTeS) will adapt texts to the reading levels of individual students, thereby filling a much-needed gap in the marketplace. With over 60% of U.S. K-12 students reading below grade level, the broader impact of the proposed technology will be in improving the literacy of a diverse population. The expected outcomes of using PeTeS will be improved vocabulary acquisition and improved reading and comprehension of texts by ELs and international students. Using PeTeS for reading may lead to better grades and higher graduation rates. PeTeS will also save teachers time on not having to explain texts or translate for students. PeTeS, will complement the instructor and provide additional support to ELs and international students, especially, in content areas, where these students have very little support.

The proposed PeTeS is envisioned to be an adaptive reading assistant for personalizing instruction. The key innovation of PeTeS is in the application of natural language processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification to dynamically meet specific reading levels - simplification being defined as an adaptation of any given text in a way that maximizes the likelihood that the student will understand its content. The key idea here is to replace a word that is presumed to be not known by the student with a word that is presumed to be known, i.e., the replacement criteria is the student?s knowledge and not the word complexity. Towards that, the proposed PeTeS technology will maintain a student knowledge model representing the reading level of the student. PeTeS will rely on the model not only to simplify the text to the student's level and improve comprehension, but also to challenge the student to learn unfamiliar words while reading whatever they need to read.

By engaging students with carefully developed interactive content, the project aims to simultaneously develop a highly practical and useful life skill (healthy cooking), create excitement about learning, and enhance student proficiency in STEAM concepts related to nutrition and global competence, when compared to a traditional school curriculum. The project aims to tackle both the failure in STEAM teaching and the obesity crisis children in the US face today. Its goal is to improve the health, education and happiness of children across the country, which is consistent with the NSF mission to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare. 


During Phase II, we will develop the current version of the project into a commercially viable educational platform, by incorporating innovative components and features, the importance of which emerged during customer discovery interviews with teachers. The finalized application will include: novel gamification features, class monitoring tools for teachers, an adaptive learning component (for more effective student learning), and an intelligent recommendation system for determining students' latent food proclivities "i.e., food dimensions that children often have a hard time articulating their preferences on, yet which play an important role in determining overall food liking" and providing healthy recipe suggestions tailored to each student's palate. This carefully crafted combination of features is meant to enhance students' learning experience and their engagement with the platform. The finalized platform will be a robust, responsive multiplatform web application that includes a complete set of K-6 lesson plans aligned with national and state educational standards and delivers an individualized learning experience to students. The learning effectiveness of the lesson plans, included scientific concepts, and gamification and personalization features will be thoroughly evaluated through in-class testing, while the recommendation system will involve the use of supervised Machine Learning.

Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material printing for novel product designs. 

This SBIR Phase II project will produce a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project will also produce an integrated system of printer control software and printhead design for production of parts with the polyurethane precursor formulas. The materials will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification. Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry, and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material  will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing technology will overcome challenges in part durability and printing speeds that are common to photo-cure approaches to produce flexible parts, and will greatly extend the part durability and flexibility available to extrusion 3D printing.

Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond."

This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be realized first in household cleaning applications, a market valued in more than 26 billion/year, where currently only about 3% of the market is filled with eco-friendly alternatives. Cleancult new scrubbing system will allow the development of more efficient and potent cleaning products, capable of competing with traditional petroleum-based brands while helping to reduce the water pollution effects due to laundry/cleaning activities, reduce the appearance of skin conditions in customers due to the continuous exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cleaning products, and reduce the energetic cost related to the use of hot water in laundry applications. Cleancult objective is to open the door to novel green clean technologies, by first introducing our all-natural scrubbing system in our products and potentially license the technology to other green detergents manufacturers, and later introduce our own all-natural green surfactant molecule, with the solid intention of increasing the green cleaners? participation in the marker by at least 20% in the next 5 years.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide funding for the development of a micellar system(s) composed of a biopolymer particle and a naturally derived from sustainable sources surfactant compound. The conjugation and stabilization mechanism of these micellar systems are the main focus on the research objectives, together with the inclusion of different functionalization to improve oil removal, avoid re-deposition and also enhance the antibacterial properties of the scrubbing system. The complete characterization of the micellar system and its efficacy in removing soil/dirt stains will be achieved through the use of spectroscopic, rheological and hydrodynamic techniques, surface chemistry modifications, and applying the global standards for detergency determination. The research team will work to provide a commercially ready product at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, and due to already in place collaborations with manufacture facilities will avoid delays in the introduction of Cleancults' new line of green powerful cleaners.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "Diesel engines remain critical to global economies, but are under threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives, like spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion. Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture, rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with, OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. 

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation, alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions. This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline. The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications. Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels. With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly precursors. They are benign and nontoxic.  Because of the low-cost nature, the carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the initial focus for many other societal needs.

This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-value uses for immediate commercial development."

Recent developments in nanotechnology and microfluidics have allowed the understanding and rational utilization of a series of micro total analysis systems (uTAS). The existing links between these two fields have enabled crossing the traditional borders and the development of unique training opportunities for students in science and engineering tracks. Furthermore, the interest in analytical applications combining microfluidics and nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the last years. Although this integration has enhanced sensing, separation, and extraction procedures, the applicability of specific nanomaterials for chemical analysis depends mainly on the chemical composition, structure, size, morphology, and preparation method.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction based on a novel photomodification technique called "LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive Index Change)." More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material, enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses. LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea. LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. 

Changing the refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia, and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555 nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

According to statista.com, the number of smartphone users in the world will be more than five billion by 2019. The popularity of these mobile devices is due to a unique set of features including ubiquitous Internet access through communication technologies such as Wifi and 4G/LTE, easy to use touch-based inputs, and numerous applications and games. In the meantime, the security of mobile devices is becoming a major concern as device users are storing sensitive data such as personal contacts and utilizing sensitive applications like banking and stock trading. Strong authentication as the forefront defense mechanism can prevent unauthorized access to a mobile device that may lead to lack of accountability, data loss or stealing, and identity theft. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and their uses in government, business, and even military applications, securing mobile devices with secure, memorable, and usable authentication is of great societal importance.

This I-Corps project focuses on exploring the market potential for multi-dimensional authentication schemes. The new paradigm of multi-dimensional authentication schemes can achieve better memorability, security, and usability at the same time. The new schemes fuse information from multiple dimensions to form a password, allowing the schemes to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference. The information fusion can increase usability as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. The schemes can also be shoulder-surfing resistant. A successful authentication requires a user to respond to a random challenge so that a set of predefined rules are satisfied after adjustments made by the user. The schemes can also be used for continuously monitoring device user behavior to ensure the current device users is a user authorized to use the device. Through this project, we will be able to investigate the needs from various customer segments and polish our technologies and prototypes to meet the needs.

These tools allow others to understand how IVAs should be architected and integrate IVA technology into their offerings. IVAs have shown promise in numerous commercial domains including financial services, healthcare, education, law enforcement, and retail, to name a few, reducing the barrier to knowledge access within domains by providing a medium for people to converse naturally with sophisticated computer and information systems.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the significant technological challenges involved when scaling the domains and capabilities of an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA). This project will innovate in designing scalable artificial intelligence models capable of learning and identifying hundreds or thousands of learned concepts, and designing the accompanying system architecture to support the growing compute demand of sophisticated algorithms. Specifically, the project aims at achieving: (1) Scalable Intelligence: the ability to handle hundreds or thousands of competencies and extractable semantic concepts, allowing users to interact with the system with unbounded, unconstrained language; (2) Customizable Intelligence: the ability to allow customers to (semi-) automatically train and (re)train and customize the intelligence on demand (adding new competencies, identifying new slot-value pairs, modify responses); (3) Conversational Complexity: support multi-turn conversations, where the context from prior utterances is used to refine and understand what the end-user is trying to accomplish; and (4) Scalable System Infrastructure: enhance open source IVA software infrastructure to seamlessly scale up and down the computational resources allocated for each intelligence engine based on load."

Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

Although it is estimated that up to 95% of the waste stream could be recycled, only a third of the 250 million tons of municipal solid waste that are generated each year in the United States is currently diverted. Greater diversion would provide immense savings in landfill and processing costs, and benefit the environment as well. Tens of millions of pounds of greenhouse gas emissions from virgin material mining may be eliminated, and pollution from landfill waste reduced. The existing sorting process is expensive and unprofitable, requiring human workers to manually sort debris, an extremely dull, dirty, and dangerous profession. This innovation has the potential to eliminate these trade-offs between cost and environmental damage. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will create a scalable, integrated robotic system that autonomously sorts material for recycling. This advance in autonomous systems is made possible by a series of innovations in robotics: (1) tremendous improvements in both computer vision and robotic manipulation, allowing for the system to be deployed with virtually zero retrofitting in existing facilities; (2) new motion planning techniques that allow for trajectories to be generated in real time, customized for the characteristics of the waste, safety, and any uncertainty in individual objects? position;&#8232; and (3) modern machine learning techniques that allow the system to classify waste at levels approaching human performance, with a continual training signal obtained via human supervision.

Additionally, for researchers and conservationists, 3D capturing is a way to preserve precious artifacts and study them without endangering of permanently losing them during transportation or due to natural deterioration. For retailers and designers, low cost accurate 3D representations of products are needed for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications that open new possibilities to connect with their customers. Finally, as display makers continue to improve upon light field (LF) displays, LF image and video will potentially become mainstream and a pipeline will need to exist to capture, compress, and stream this new form of media.

This I-Corps project utilizes a specialized computer numerical control camera and compression algorithms to record multiple photos of an object or a scene and based on this raw data to construct light field (LF) images which preserve the complex interactions between the lights and the surfaces in the scene. This project develops compression and reconstruction algorithms that exploit the redundant information found in LF images while also allowing quick decompression on viewing devices (applicable for web, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR)). The 3D content (object or scene) can then be viewed with six degrees of freedom and in stereovision.

By testing drug toxicity and efficacy in a human model, drugs can get to market more quickly, with less risk and lower costs, while potentially reducing the use of animal testing. Currently it takes an average of 10 years and $2.8B to get a drug to market, with the majority of the cost due to late-stage drug failures. The ability to screen drugs in human organ systems that are predictive of in vivo conditions will better inform "go/no-go" decision-making throughout the stages of drug development. Broader impacts include the ability to create clinical trials "in-a-dish" where patient populations that will benefit the most from the drug versus those that would be at risk can be determined before clinical testing. Use of patient-specific cells may enable the development of disease models where animal models failed to recapitulate the disease, as well as drug testing for rare diseases, where the limited number of affected individuals prevents the standard clinical trial format. 

This I-Corps project utilizes a modular platform designed to physiologically integrate multiple human tissue engineered organ models though vascular connections that mimic how organs are connected to one another in the human body. The connected tissue engineered models are individually matured prior to integration to provide the high biological fidelity needed to accurately recapitulate organ level responses of health and disease. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells enables the use of patient-specific cells and gene-edited cells, as well as provides a platform to further precision medicine initiatives.

The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

"abstractText": "In the past several years, cyber-crime and cyber-breaches have exploded, due to the increase in commerce conducted on the Internet, as well as increasing quantities of sensitive information being stored in databases that can be accessed by outside parties.  In addition, cyber-criminals have advanced, not only employing technical acumen but also preying on human error by using sophisticated techniques like phishing. To address these challenges, the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDIH) will convene two workshops to bring together experts from academia, government, and industry in the fields of insurance, cybersecurity, data science, and policy. The ultimate goal is to develop a collaborative model (e.g., a cross sector consortium) that will help to define the frequency and economic/social severity related to successful attacks, and to begin to develop baselines for measuring and managing cyber risk more effectively. 
 
NEBDIH will seek to gather leading academic, government, risk management, general industry and healthcare participants, whose mission will be to identify, quantify, and to help mitigate risk associated with cyber-related criminal activity. The workshops will serve as a forum for these experts to collaborate on: 1) better understanding and defining the interrelated cybersecurity landscape across sectors, and 2) planning for the resources necessary to develop baselines for measuring and managing cybersecurity risk. Expected outcomes from these activities include developing a framework for filling the gaps in quantifying and managing cybersecurity risk across organizations and sectors.  This may take the form of an initiative that captures the best  of breed technologies, vendors, and best practices; captures a substantial portion of the data that is required, in aggregate, to make a cybersecurity risk assessment at multiple levels (by industry, by region, by company); provides the tools to make the data discoverable and interoperable; and provides a basic suite of tools to allow for high level analysis of the data within the context of cybersecurity risk."

"abstractText": "Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to drive economic growth and innovation by increasing a knowledge worker's ease of access to the digital information that is relevant to his/her work. Businesses today are enormously dependent on the archives of files, communication, and other information contained within the systems and services they rely on (networked drives, cloud storage, messaging tools, email, etc.). As these archives grow, they are increasingly hard to standardize and organize so that individuals know where to look for and how to find the information they need to do their jobs. The result is that individual employees waste enormous amounts of time trying to locate files and information fragmented across complex directories and many communication channels. Centralizing access to files and communication within an easily searchable and flexible workspace can unlock several hours of lost productivity and duplicate efforts per knowledge worker per week. Furthermore, presenting all of the relevant context around each file and message, including other file-versions, related files, discussions, activity events, etc., can help knowledge workers today with better version control, an understanding of how projects/ideas unfold, transferring of best practices, and preventing institutional knowledge-loss.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to further develop a novel method for users to contextually and unobtrusively access all relevant files and information associated with their work. This project focuses on developing software that can automatically map the relationships between digital workflow components (email messages, chat messages, tasks, contacts, files, etc.), and store them in discrete private databases controlled by the users. This project's key technical challenges include: improving the proprietary algorithms that automatically interconnect user information (while the information remains hosted on third party systems/services); improving the scalability of data ingress, processing, indexing, and syncing; and establishing a system capable of hosting and processing a multitude of discrete and disconnected databases of user information. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new type of software platform that can be hosted in private instances and that improves the productivity of its users by: consolidating user information stored on third-party systems/services; making it all easily searchable and manageable; and augmenting every file with additional history and context from all other connected third party systems/services.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to address the lack of approved device therapies available for the almost 4 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from diastolic heart failure (DHF) - a disease for which the potential market is estimated to be approximately $5B worldwide. In DHF, the chambers of the heart become stiff and cannot relax completely, reducing the amount with which they fill with blood and thus reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart during each cardiac cycle. The only evidence-based therapy to treat DHF is to manage blood pressure pharmacologically, and treat associated complications. DHF is a major cause of hospital admissions and has poor patient outcomes, without any discernable improvement over the last two decades. Thus, there is a strong need for an effective device solution that can alleviate the symptoms associated with DHF while improving patient outcomes, as well as further fundamental understanding of the key factors and mechanisms that lead to DHF. 

This project is focused on the development of a non-blood contacting biventricular diastolic recoil device for the treatment of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also referred to as diastolic heart failure (DHF). The proposed device will provide a patented minimally invasive, non-blood contacting approach to mitigate the symptoms associated with HFpEF, addressing a large unmet need in a market which currently lacks any approved device therapies. Primary goals of this Phase I project include investigating variations in device design, functionality, and mechanical properties in pilot animal studies in order to optimize augmentation of cardiac function and hemodynamics, as well as the development of an accelerated fatigue test apparatus to test the durability of the device components. The commercialization effort in bringing this novel device to market will address the largely unmet need for the millions of Americans who suffer from DHF by alleviating symptoms, significantly increasing quality of life, and reducing morbidity and mortality.

"abstractText": "This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions."

"abstractText": "This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an enzyme immobilization platform to be used in the production of biopharmaceuticals and other biomanufacturing processes to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing biotherapeutics.  Biopharmaceutical sales have soared in recent years and healthcare authorities have increased pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the cost of biologics leaving pharmaceutical engineers to focus on reducing bioproduction costs.  To accomplish this goal, pharmaceutical companies are aggressively investigating continuous processing technologies to reduce the capital and other costs associated with biopharmaceutical manufacture. The immobilization platform described in this proposal will provide a technology that is compatible with continuous processing strategies to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing biotherapeutics.  In addition, this platform has the potential to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of biomanufacturing processes across several other industries including food, leather, and textiles. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop pH responsive immobilized enzymes for the production of biopharmaceuticals. There are three key technical challenges associated with this project: The immobilized-enzyme must demonstrate pH responsive behavior compatible with biologics manufacture (pH 6-7); mass transfer of protein substrates must be comparable to the native enzyme; and extended shelf-life of the immobilized-enzyme is required for long-term storage. To mitigate these challenges, this project aims to covalently bind an enzyme to a pH responsive polymer that is formulated to have reversible solubility near neutral pH. The solubility of the immobilized-biocatalyst can be tightly controlled within a specified pH range allowing for continuous processing and facile purification of the biotherapeutic product. Poor mass transfer often results from immobilizing biocatalysts on solid supports. These challenges are further exaggerated in bioconjugation reactions because the coupling partner, a protein, is generally more affected by sterics than small molecules. Therefore, fabrication of the solid support will be explored to produce resins of varied size, morphologies, and dissolution properties that are compatible with macromolecule functionalization. Additionally, the immobilized enzyme generated in this project can be utilized under soluble conditions, which combines the positive attributes of both immobilization and soluble enzyme catalysis. The final challenge of developing a commercially viable shelf-life of the catalyst will be addressed through development of novel drying protocols. Shelf-stable immobilized enzymes will be developed so that inventory can be maintained without requiring long lead times for catalyst production.

Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.  This will be accomplished by developing and validating a platform technology to identify compounds produced by the microbiome that are associated with biochemical pathways of interest, and use the identified compounds to target those pathways whose end-products comprise natural mosquito-repellent compounds. The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.

Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

Global cybersecurity spending is increasing significantly year over year. Enormous R&D resources have been invested in the development of a range of security products to meet this market. However, different security product providers repeatedly build the fundamental security analytics tools and use them to further develop different innovative security solutions. That is a huge waste of R&D resources.  The proposed solution reduces the R&D expenditure of customers and lowers the entry bar for the growing cybersecurity market. With the lowered entry bar, the company anticipates that more innovations will be put into practice. As a result, with the increased competition and reduced R&D expenditure, the company expects a reduction in cybersecurity spending by companies and the government.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on malware intelligence, which has been a long-standing as well as increasingly complex cybersecurity problem. Traditional signature based detection and manual reverse engineering approaches can no longer keep up with the pace of increasingly sophisticated obfuscation and attack techniques. The objective of this project is to develop a security analysis tool for malware intelligence by combining the following two unique techniques: "whole-system emulation based dynamic binary analysis" and "deep-learning based binary code similarity detection". The first technique provides a fine-grained monitor capability to observe the behaviors of malware. The second technique provides the capability of learning and characterizing complex features. By combining these two techniques, the proposed technology will be able to better understand malware and generate actionable intelligence."

High blood pressure (BP) is a major cardiovascular risk factor that affects up to 1 billion people worldwide. It is treatable, yet hypertension awareness and control rates are low. Ubiquitous BP monitoring technology could improve hypertension management, but existing devices require an inflatable cuff and therefore do not afford anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The market for a portable, cuff-less blood pressure monitor is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Successful completion of this project via demonstration of measurement accuracy across a broad range of blood pressures will provide the company with a strong position in this large market. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate to much greater awareness and control of hypertension, helping reduce the incidence and burden of cardiovascular disease around the world.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology for cuff-less and calibration-free measurement of blood pressure via a button on a smartphone. Existing automated cuff-based monitors are bulky and do not enable anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The 'oscillometric finger pressing method'is an emerging approach that uses the same measurement principle that is employed by most automatic cuff devices, but instead of inflating a cuff, the user presses his or her finger (and the underlying artery) against a combination of optical and pressure sensors to determine the blood pressure. The objectives of this program are to shrink the current prototype design and validate its accuracy. The proposed R&D plan includes miniaturization of the circuit components to mount them on a single board and optimization of the sensing technology and algorithm to work in a broad range of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. This work will be followed up by a clinical test of the monitor. The resulting device is expected to be small and thin enough to mount to the back of a smartphone and demonstrate clinical-grade accuracy for the measurement of blood pressure.

Aligning with the NSF's mission to develop innovative education programs to enhance aspects of emotional intelligence, this project will address three major pain points for young learners with far-reaching implications. First, the need to develop emotional intelligence; which has been identified as a 21st-century literacy that is crucial for younger learners to thrive. Current school climate issues with bullying and violence consistently reinforce the need to address social and emotional learning. Next, the need to integrate social and emotional learning into regular classroom activities. With the demands placed on schools for testing, having a program that integrates with what schools are already responsible should support more widespread adoption. Finally, the program addresses a widespread need to combat the deleterious effects of the current uses of social media by young students. This project will bring a positive spin to social networking that can improve the emotional intelligence skills of students


The proposed innovation is an augmented reality-based experience that immerses fourth and fifth-grade students in activities designed to build their skills of emotional intelligence; namely, emotional self-awareness and empathy, as they interact with a network of peers. The key technical challenges the project must solve include: refining core methods for developing emotional self-awareness and empathy, defining and refining a user experience that teachers/parents will find educationally compelling and with which learners will love to engage, designing a curating process for learner-generated content that will ensure the safety and security of all users and developing virtual interactions that engage students in emotional skill development, and connecting activities with the materials for which students are already responsible.

In many cases, it has proven much more difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable, high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise not have acceptable internal return on development capital. 

This SBIR Phase II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches, relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability from high-throughput small-scale screens or "microfermentations" to fully instrumented bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will further the development of an orally administered gene delivery vehicle called the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP) that is able to overcome the physical barriers of the mucus to deliver DNA-based drugs to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The therapeutic agent will then be expressed as a protein locally in the gastrointestinal tract or be secreted into the bloodstream to treat the full body. Development of this vehicle will lead to novel scientific insights on DNA delivery that will benefit and educate the field of fundamental science and engineering. Successful commercialization would benefit pharmaceutical companies by providing an oral drug delivery platform for approved and novel drugs, U.S. patients by reducing the need for injectable drugs and thereby increasing compliance and quality of life, and payers by reducing costs associated with injectable drugs and improving outcomes by increasing patient compliance via oral administration. The drug-agnostic feature provides broad and diverse market opportunities within the rapidly expanding market for biologics, among other therapeutic agents leading to substantial job creation. As an example, a potential addressable market in four areas (i.e., delivering TNF inhibitors, protein replacement, peptide hormones, and blood factors) exceeds $90 billion per year.

This project is designed to prepare a stable oral formulation of the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP), a novel drug-agnostic drug delivery vehicle, and demonstrate that it can deliver a functional DNA cargo for expression and secretion in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. This project focuses on the technical challenges associated with preserving the functionality of a DNA cargo as an example of a challenging drug delivery scenario that is difficult to replicate. The innovation is the design of the vehicle to penetrate through the mucus and transfect underlying epithelial cells by mimicking the enteric poliovirus. This will lay the foundation for the first oral gene therapy. Briefly, the project will address three objectives. First, preparation of a formulation for the CRP for oral administration via lyophilization with analyses to assess formulation and DNA stability as a function of time, temperature, and pH. Second, testing the ability of the orally formulated CRP to deliver a functional DNA plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro by measuring both cellular and secreted expression. Finally, testing the ability of the orally formulated and administered CRP to deliver a functional Gaussia luciferase plasmid to intestinal epithelial cells in vivo in Fischer 344 rats to assess expression and secretion.

Doane College, a small liberal arts college in Crete, Nebraska, will send at least nine undergraduate science students and three postdoctoral fellows to Germany to conduct nanotechnology research at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Three students and a postdoctoral fellow will go each summer for the duration of three consecutive years. The work involves the development of a versatile nano-scaled detection tool that could provide a high societal impact. In Germany, Doane students will work in the labs of Dr. Michael Hirtz and Dr. Pavel Levkin, both well-known internationally for their expertise on nano-scale phenomena. The undergraduate students will receive extensive research training, as well as culture and language preparation at Doane College before their departure to Germany. While in Germany, the research team will be given an in-depth orientation to the country and the research setting at KIT from the project?s Principle Investigator and the international collaborators. Through the PI, the student team will also be linked with investigators at the Center for Nanohybrid Functional Materials at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. The students, who are relatively isolated in the US heartland, greatly benefit from the exposure to a culture abroad, providing a new experience for them. The project provides increased student, post-doc fellow, and faculty understanding of the collaborative research process, as well as potentially motivating undergraduates to continue their studies and/or careers in science, technology, engineering and math. 

Part 2:
The research collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany will advance a technology called DETECHIP (short for detection chip). This is a proven sensor technology based on differential responses of colorimetric and fluorometric sensing elements upon exposure to small molecules of interest, such as drugs of abuse, explosives, and pesticides. 

DETECHIP is evolving from a macroscale, liquid-phase-testing array utilizing a 96-well plate to a micro-scale, solid-phase array through the use of piezoelectric and inkjet printing. Seeking to further miniaturize and optimize DETECHIP, this work will incorporate Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) that is available at KIT for micro-to-nanoscale array fabrication on novel polymeric surfaces. In collaboration with the KIT collaborators, the Doane investigators will incorporate the chemical sensors onto amphiphilic nanoporous (HEMA) polymeric surfaces that are produced at KIT.

The goal is the uniform fabrication and analysis of arrays for the detection of small molecules. Expected deliverables include: 1) a small micro-to-nanometer-scaled, polymer-supported DETECHIP array; 2) methodology for bench-top or portable analysis with the best imaging and/or read-out technology to be determined during this project period; and 3) reports documenting the efficacy, ease of use, and cost effectiveness of the resulting DETECHIP technology.

This international collaboration sets the stage for US post-docs and undergraduates to apply for German Humboldt, Fulbright, and DAAD-RISE fellowships, while German KIT students can participate in academic exchange programs with Doane College."

Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the US with a 6 fold increase in incidence in the last 4 decades. Most endoscopists are not trained well to detect pre-cancer in the esophagus as <5% have received dedicated advanced imaging training to identify dysplasia (advanced precancer) within Barrett's Esophagus. There are well-proven minimally invasive endoscopic treatments for dysplasia and early esophageal cancer that are >95% effective in providing cure to the patient. On the other hand, when cancer is caught at a later stage the only option is removal of the esophagus with surgery in combination with expensive chemotherapy and radiation. Creating this real-time Artificial Intelligence system will assist endoscopists to detect precancer earlier, prevent this deadly cancer and expand access to esophageal cancer screening to the community at large and also to the underserved community, who typically have fewer well-trained physicians.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first system that can detect dysplasia in Barrett's Esophagus in real-time during endoscopy. This proposed research will expand on the company's preliminary work in detecting dysplastic lesions in colonoscopy and applying transfer learning methods to develop the first ever dysplasia-detection algorithm for upper endoscopy. It will initially be trained using static, annotated images, and will expand on the company's software platform to be able to eventually process video feeds, in real-time, from device makers without frame-drop or lag. The company has begun engaging with endoscopy OEMs to define metrics for success in running real-time algorithms.

"abstractText": "This project, from Dartmouth College, creates an Innovation Corps Site.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 
I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Dartmouth's I-Corps Site provides intensive entrepreneurial training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine, and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship and Technology Transfer (OETT). 

The intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers, and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration, pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation, or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists in a completely different area. 

The objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop. After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network, local angel investors, and other organizations.

Broader Impacts: 
The broader impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%, respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50% women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs semi-annually."

Current lightweight radiation shielding materials lack the required temperature stability.  New radiation shielding materials with better properties are needed to protect the health of biological, electrical, and structural systems in radioactive environments.  Radiation shielding improvements in the nuclear industry could result in upwards of one billion dollars in savings annually and result in lower electricity costs.  Commercialization of these advanced materials can also minimize the effects of disasters like Fukushima and reduce the costs of clean-up efforts.  Lightweight radiation shielding materials are also needed in airplanes and satellites to protect workers and electronic systems from cosmic radiation and for medical personnel working with radiation related treatments. 
 
This I-Corps project is based on an innovative lightweight radiation shielding material that withstands operating temperatures nearly double those of commercially available products.  It has been demonstrated that the addition of carbon-based particles can more quickly move heat away from radioactive waste; this enables safer disposal options for the nuclear waste.  Additional technical merit lies in the fabrication process that has been developed to reduce the weight and size of the material.  It also enables the technology to be cost competitive with existing products while providing better shielding properties. The I-Corps investigation will determine the commercial potential for this material.

Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges."

"abstractText": "With this award, NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering provides three years of support for twelve Davidson College undergraduate students to engage in high-impact research opportunities in Dusseldorf, Germany in collaboration with the research group of Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann at the Heinrich-Heine-Universitat (HHU). The specific research focuses on the preparation of a series of specialized compounds that present carbohydrates in a precise fashion to study fundamental carbohydrate-protein interactions. These interactions are important because they play critical roles in a number of biological processes from cell communication to microbial infectivity and cancer. Despite their importance, many questions remain as to how the precise presentation of carbohydrates impacts their ability to be recognized by proteins, and how the resulting carbohydrate-protein interaction impacts downstream biological events. The research outlined in this award aims to address this knowledge gap while simultaneously providing valuable research opportunities in a high-impact international research setting. Undergraduate participants will receive training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that will enhance their education and prepare them for a competitive international workforce. Furthermore, results from this award will promote the progress of science by directly advancing the fields of carbohydrate and polymer science, including initiatives highlighted under the National Academy of Sciences report, "Transforming the Glycosciences: A Roadmap to the Future (2012)", which specifically emphasizes a broader understanding of the roles of carbohydrate polymers in chemical, biological and industrial processes. Long term, the results from this research may ultimately lead to advancements in national health, prosperity and welfare by providing a better understanding of the fundamental roles carbohydrates play in human health and disease. 

One of the major challenges in studying molecular interactions between carbohydrates and other biomolecules is the low binding affinity of individual carbohydrate subunits. Biological systems overcome this issue by increasing localized concentrations of carbohydrate residues or by the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands on proteins, lipids or cell surfaces. Molecular scaffolds, which can be selectively tuned to vary the number and density of sugar ligands along a defined oligomeric backbone, can be used to gain fundamental insights into multivalent carbohydrate interactions and the processes they govern. The research in this proposal, which will be conducted with Davidson College undergraduate participants and in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann and her team at Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, uses a systematic approach to synthesize several precision glycoconjugates to study the relationships between the ways in which carbohydrate ligands are presented (e.g. on a rigid oligoproline scaffold versus a more flexible oligo(amidoamine) scaffold), and how that presentation impacts carbohydrate binding in two classes of carbohydrate binding proteins: galectins and the C-type lectins. The overarching research question that will be addressed by the proposed research is: How does the presentation of carbohydrates on well-defined rigid or flexible scaffolds impact their ability to engage proteins involved in specific recognition events? The outcomes of this research will provide greater insight into factors that govern carbohydrate recognition and may help scientists better understand how recognition events and the corresponding biological outcomes of those events are tuned by carbohydrate display.

The provisional-patent-protected innovation, a single-test immunoassay for pet disease diagnosis, is expected to lead to significant outcomes in the animal healthcare commercial market, with an option of expanding to other markets.

This project is based on technology that combines in a single test (such as a paper strip test) the high sensitivity, selectivity and wide working range of the particle immunoassay for diagnosing pets' diseases at various stages. The unique feature of our test is high sensitivity with the incorporated protection against false-negative analytical bias caused by the high dose effect, which is important for the diagnostic accuracy of late- and early-stage disease. The selectivity of the test has been demonstrated to detect about 0.01 Units per milliliter of ovarian cancer biomarker 125 in human blood plasma, with near single-molecule assay selectivity. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the proposed approach was modified based on the heterogeneous-media encapsulation of gold nanoparticles modified with biotin and iron oxide microparticles modified with streptavidin. This test offers significant competitive advantages over existing technologies: it can be used for early- and late-stages of disease; manufacturing and operational costs are low, based on a cheap point-of-care application; and it offers the possibility of detecting multiple modalities of disease in one test.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team."

The photo-catalytic reactors funded in the project will lead to novel methods to chemically store energy from the sun.  Each year, human activity releases 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Dimensional Energy envisions a future in which we can utilize this carbon dioxide as a feedstock for industrial production of hydrocarbon fuels and chemical intermediaries by harnessing the power of the sun. 

This STTR Phase II project proposes to develop HI-Light - a photo-thermo-catalytic reactor platform technology that enables the conversion of CO2 and water to synthesis gas at a rate significantly greater than the state of the art.  The unique feature of the technology is that it uses embedded optical waveguides to evenly distribute light within the reactor, increasing the efficacy of the catalyst and ultimately the productivity of the system.  In Phase I a fully functional integrated prototype reactor was constructed, demonstrating continuous operation, and showing productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon produced per gram of catalyst per hour more than 10x greater than the state of the art.  The approach solves the two major roadblocks in photo-conversion of CO2: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented, multi-scale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance reaction efficiency.

This project provides unique technological advancements that circumvent traditional limits in speed of operation and in energy usage by taming the collective response of clouds of electrons in response to excitation - known as opto-plasmonic devices (OPD) - resulting in much more sensitive, high speed, and low power-consumption devices which convert optical signals to electrical ones, performing a crucial step in information transport.  This reduces the energy cost-per-bit of information, helping Photonics Integrated Circuit (PIC) technology to become mainstream for general public use in applications such as in affordable ultra-high-speed Internet, high-capacity Internet-of-Things (IoT), and energy-saving cloud data storage and processing. Notably, this project contributes to the technological leadership of the US in the multi-billion dollar global communications markets, by generating advanced technical know-how and intellectual property, holding the key in manufacturing of new OPDs. Successful completion of this project results in a business opportunity for several sustainable jobs for electrical and optical engineers with potential for exponential growth in line with increasing demand for data communication. 

This I-Corps project produces market-ready high-speed photodetector technology based on Indium Phosphide material system that are i) capable of operation in tele/data communication rates of more than 200 Gbits/sec, which is six times faster than state-of-the-art, and ii) compatible with Silicon Photonics technology through a heterogeneous integration with silicon. Specifically, this product solves a bottleneck in high-speed operation of Silicon Photonics Integrated Circuits that rely on Germanium-based photodetectors as their optical receiver. For this product to be commercially ready, research and development plan includes major milestones of a) producing a stand-alone side-illuminated InP-based high speed photodetector compatible with optical communication wavelengths, and b) integration of the developed InP-based optical receiver into a Si-Photonics integrated circuit. Prototyping work will be done using NSF-supporting fabrication facilities, but volume production feasibility will be demonstrated by utilizing a fab-less model and using existing silicon foundry services across the United States.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to fill a void in the products and services that teach language to children with autism and to non-native English speakers. Approximately one-third of individuals with autism exhibit a deficit in expressing themselves in sentences. The traditional language remediation for autism is in-person therapy. Computerized therapies offer more intensive instruction at lower cost, but existing programs do not fully address the language deficits seen in autism. In addition, the National Council for Education Statistics reports a population of English as a Second Language (ESL) students that grew from 8.1 percent in 2000 to 9.5 percent in 2015.  The program developed here offers both ESL and autistic students personalized, automated instruction, along with a comprehensive curriculum, in core areas of English: grammar and syntax. Mastering these requires a level of extensive practice, personalized learning, and linguistic expertise that exceeds both the capacities of in-person therapies and teacher-directed instruction, and the capabilities of the language software programs that are currently on the market.

This I-Corps project involves the development and commercialization of an English language teaching program providing personalized instruction in sentence construction.  Informed by research showing that mastering a language requires active practice, the system uses pictures and verbal prompts (spoken and written) to prompt learners put words together into specific types of phrases and sentences. These targeted language structures gradually increase in length and complexity. Learners construct their responses from scratch through open-ended word-button clicking, keyboard typing, or speech.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a new standard of plant purity, which can have tremendous positive health consequences for the millions of worldwide consumers. The cold plasma water purification and enrichment technology, utilized in our proposed hydroponic system, can extend to other areas of agriculture as the antimicrobial chemicals produced in plasma rapidly kill pathogens and are safe for both plants and animals. The potential benefits stemming from this technology can help vertical farmers to eradicate food scarcity challenges in urban centers all over the world, powered by the sun's energy. Given the imminent, significant, and accelerating problems of agricultural sustainability and water conservation facing humanity, this technology has the potential to play a significant role in helping to preserve and sustain life on Earth as we know it. Additionally, the decrease in water volume needed for irrigation and the increased yield of plants treated with plasma-treated water also supports applications of plasma treatment in various farming and reforestation efforts. Finally, an ambitious goal for the company is to implement this technology in environments where resources other than electricity are extremely limited, such as long-term space missions.

This I-Corps project will allow the company to better understand the needs of the company's potential customers and how plasma technology can offer solutions to the commercial agricultural market while providing technological insight to members of the hydroponic agriculture industry and opportunities for significant improvements to their existing agricultural systems and practices. Through these plasma technology commercialization efforts, the team envisions facilitating bigger, healthier, and more sustainable crop harvests for the modern farmer, while also reducing the volume of potentially harmful chemical additives, environmental damage, and wastefulness associated with current production methods. Current lab-scale research results are very promising, however, detailed analysis of the market and interviews with professional hydroponic farmers, industry experts, vendors, and customers are required to validate full-scale commercialization.

"abstractText": "Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (requiring e.g., the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of drone-based technology to manage fires more safely, efficiently, and effectively.  Wildfires cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damages in the United States. As the size and number of wildfires increases, prescribed fires have emerged as one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce catastrophic damage by removing excess fuel for wildfires and controlling their evolution. Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems. This project has the potential to shape how fire management is conducted in the future, making it safer for fire personnel and enabling cost-effective prescribed fire practices that can help society to control catastrophic wildfires and better manage landscapes.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of drone-based technology that will transform fire management. Current drone-based ignition and monitoring systems have the potential to change the field but are hampered by their extensive reliance on human controllers. This lack of automation limits these systems? potential applicability, scale, effectiveness, and unnecessarily increases their risk. The proposed work aims to make monitoring and ignition more intelligent and scalable through: 1) specialized machine learning pipelines to characterize fire fronts and identify ground assets; 2) light-weight fire simulation engine that can provide short-horizon prediction of the fire front evolution while executing on limited computer power; and 3) distributed planning algorithms that adjust the drone's trajectory and sphere drop strategy to manipulate fire intensity while keeping ground assets, vehicles, and personnel safe. These challenges are especially difficult to address given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone navigation and fire management.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is revolutionizing how farmers grow their crops and significantly reduced the dependence on fertilizers or pesticides to maximize yields. Understanding how to manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in agriculture.  This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently, agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.

This I-Corps project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology remediates these negative fitness cost by "stalling" the translation of the gene of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops, such as wheat or corn."

"abstractText": "This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures >700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316/316L stainless steel at the temperatures >700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?/kwh to the target 3?/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work.


The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures >700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures>700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners. The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  

Big data, generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery) that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education in schools and colleges."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize new sensor technologies that enable the rapid measurement of the handedness of molecular mixtures.   Like screws and keys, many molecules possess a certain handedness that can be important when interacting with living systems.  This issue is vital to pharmaceutical research, where one handed form of a drug may result in benefits while the opposite form may cause harmful side effects.  Consequently, measuring the handedness of molecular mixtures is of paramount importance in modern pharmaceutical research.  However, conventional approaches to making these measurements are often too slow for modern pharmaceutical discovery and development research where high-throughput experiments on hundreds or even thousands of samples per day are performed.  This project aims to remove this bottleneck by leveraging a recently introduced new instrument and commercializing reagent kits that have been shown in academic laboratories to achieve a much faster and simpler method for measuring the handedness of molecular mixtures.  Making this improved technology widely available to the greater research and development community has the potential to streamline drug development efforts at reduced cost and minimized waste production, which is expected to increase profit margins and create new jobs in research, development and manufacturing, resulting in substantial benefit to the health and economy of the United States.  

The innovation of this project comprises a series of optical sensors, developed during a decade of fundamental research in the participating laboratories, which will allow rapid eescreening of a variety of asymmetric reactions. The focus of this unprecedented enterprise is to validate selected sensors against pharmaceutically relevant compounds, determine the error of the optical assays by comparison with traditional techniques such as chiral HPLC, to evaluate the robustness in the presence of potential interferants, and to apply a sensor in the analysis of an asymmetric reaction using multi-well plate technology. The development of a user-friendly kit will include the testing of different methods for the creation of pre-dispensed dried sensors that can be reconstituted without leaving behind residues that might increase the error margin beyond a few percent which is generally acceptable for high-throughput screening applications. The final outcome will be a convenient mix-and-measure protocol that enables rapid analysis of hundreds of small-scale asymmetric reaction mixtures.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is empowering the 68 million U.S. natural gas consumers to know their transaction status in real time, have more and continual control of their transactions, settle transactions in increments less than the industry?s current monthly accounting cycle and enjoy an extremely high level of security. Their transaction cost will be reduced and speed increased, freeing industry capacity and resources to be employed elsewhere at greater value. This innovation will allow others in the natural gas industry to better consider transaction processes and themselves innovate - employing many minds on industry efficiency. This innovation will also have application to other industries characterized by multiple complex, multi-party transactions; particularly the electric utility industry and possibly providing the catalyst for more extensive deregulation and consumer control.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover how to transform complex natural gas utility transaction management processes using Blockchain innovations and related technologies across production, transmission, distribution and consumption functions. The United States utility industry has operated in its present physical form for more than a century. Over the past four decades the industry has evolved through various policy and regulatory actions to open transaction participation to thousands of parties. During the past two decades, digital technologies enabled transaction functions to talk to each other and perform some functions automatically. Despite this progress, utility transaction management processes are essentially those created decades ago. They still require significant human intervention, remain highly segmented and employ little digital intelligence and security technology available today. The various technologies now supporting the industry?s seven step transaction processes will be mapped, assessed for Blockchain technology application and then consolidated into a single platform. The key challenge is to create transformative technology integrating the numerous other existing technology applications and data exchange formats and protocols without succumbing to customization which then mutes the transformative nature of the innovation and renders it ineffective as a platform to subsequent industry innovation by multiple parties.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform the culture of photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms. Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.

This project goes deeper than many traditional socio-emotional programs by fortifying children with the behavioral skills and mindset they need to evolve as effective leaders. The educational curriculum was developed by psychologists who specialize in leadership development, and is based on cutting-edge child developmental, leadership, and educational research. This project aims to research the engagement and effectiveness of the program and its ability to enhance ten core leadership behaviors in youth, at home, in the community, and in academic settings. This program has the potential to make a long-term impact on the next generation of youth, promoting resilience in the face of adverse events, such as school violence and cyberbullying, and to positively shape the next generation of leaders, helping them form lifelong commitments to personal and professional development. The project has philanthropic aspirations to make the educational curriculum available to all children and schools, regardless of socio-economic standing, supporting the mission of NSF to promote the health, prosperity and welfare of the nation through science.


This project is focused on the development of an interactive leadership program for children, that is proven to make a positive impact on leadership behaviors and that is also fun and engaging for youth and their adult caregivers and educators. What sets this program apart from others is that the research will provide evidence that the program builds the critical skills it intends on developing in children. The program is designed to be self-led or facilitated by an adult caregiver or educator, either using an online platform or physical materials.  As children move from one leadership competency to another, they are extrinsically and intrinsically rewarded for their efforts. Adult caregivers and educators are encouraged to participate and are provided mastery building exercises that help them take the child?s leadership understanding and skill to the next level. A database has been developed to track real-time participant feedback as curriculum elements are developed. The testing of educational content will focus on three aspects, which include maximizing content appropriateness, validating learning and skill retention, and assessing variances and preferences for mode of delivery. Results will be used to make modifications to the curriculum and product design for commercialization.

Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to boost the power output of solar cells by 5-6% and reduce manufacturing costs by ~5%. By commercializing the proposed effectively transparent contact (ETC) technology the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of solar energy systems could be dramatically reduced, resulting in accelerated adoption of solar energy to address greenhouse gas emission and to become independent of fossil fuels. Improving power output of solar cells is one of the most effective means to drive down LCOE, and the ETC technology is broadly applicable to improve the power output of nearly all types of solar cells. Lower-cost solar cells can also be expected to benefit the developing world as well as disadvantaged communities that lack access to the power grid. In the near term, the proposed ETC technology will unlock higher power output and new applications for III-V photovoltaics, which are used predominantly in aerospace, defense, high performance consumer electronics and automotive. These rapidly growing markets require higher power output solar cells to add functionality (RADAR, LIDAR and surveillance) by increasing the payload capacity that is currently limited by the available space to mount the solar cells. 

The proposed project will demonstrate the commercial viability of the ETC technology by demonstrating a new world record solar cell and scalable fabrication on commercial III-V solar cells. Metal contacts are required for charge extraction from solar cells, typically covering 5-6% of the front surface and blocking sunlight from reaching the photovoltaic material below. These losses due to blocking of incoming sunlight by the metal contacts are the largest single contribution to the performance loss in most solar cells. The proposed ETC technology eliminates these losses and thereby boost the solar cell power output by 5-6%. The ETC technology has been demonstrated at lab scale and is world's highest performing front contact technology. During the research project, ETCs will be integrated with commercial III-V solar cells supplied by prospective initial customers and world-leading research partners. The technical viability of ETCs will be established by achieving dramatic improvements in cell efficiency for each cell type, whereas the commercial viability will be established by successfully integrating the ETCs using techniques, materials, and tools suitable for commercial scale-up. Completion of these objectives will accelerate the efforts to commercialize the ETC technology, which will broadly increase power output and reduce cost of solar energy.

Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology in the Information Technology (IT) sector, and the application container market is a rapidly growing segment of this sector. Although containers provide a simpler and more efficient apparatus to host applications in the cloud, there are important problems to address, such as weak security isolation, low kernel compatibility, and poor kernel customization. Security is the most common concern because one infected kernel can affect a multitude of containers. So far, each organization that has adopted container applications has been required to independently ensure their own security. One study found that a majority (54% of participants) ran containers on top of virtual machines (VMs) for security isolation, which sacrifices performance and cost efficiency. Thus, there is a significant need to provide a container architecture that supports greater security without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. This project addresses this urgent need, and the resulting technology can be applied broadly to domains such as cloud computing, Information Technology (IT) infrastructures, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), etc.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further improve usability, security, and efficiency of a novel software application container architecture, so that it can be easily deployed and evaluated by customers. While the current platform can run Docker containers without modifications, it is incompatible with the Docker and Kubernetes orchestration platforms, which is a probable obstacle to adoption for many container users and developers. The novel containers can run unmodified iterations of existing applications and automatically optimize performance of many applications by patching the binary during runtime. However, it is challenging to handle complicated scenarios in the application binary, and a more sophisticated technique is required to further improve the coverage of the automatic binary optimization module. Due to the licensing requirements of some of the software the novel container platform is based on, the research prototype is run open-source. The goal of this project is to address these limitations and challenges through five major objectives: support Docker and Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility; improve automatic binary optimization coverage; re-design the platform to avoid open-source license violations; further improve security; develop an automatic installation tool and a product demonstration.

"abstractText": "This project, from East Carolina University (ECU), creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution. 

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

ECU's I-Corp Site program, titled Idea 2 Impact GO (I2I GO), is designed to be an economic driver for eastern North Carolina by 1) engaging faculty, staff, students, and local industry partners in the ideation process; 2) improving assessment of ideas for product market fit before extensive resources are invested; and 3) making resources available to develop preliminary models or prototypes for demonstration of product potential to likely customers.

I2I GO enables key resource providers, such as ECU's Office of Innovation and Economic Development, the Office of Public Service and Community Relations, the College of Business, the Miller School of Entrepreneurship, and regional industry and economic development partners to merge together to produce greater outcomes together than as independent agents. The collective resources of these and other providers have been defined, cataloged, and reflected in the newly established Idea 2 Impact (I2I) portal. I2I utilizes proven approaches to innovation and commercialization, including Human Centered Design Thinking, Lean LaunchPad, Value Proposition Design and the Business Model Canvas. Combined with facilities such as this institution's Idea Lab, Innovation Design Lab, MakerBot Innovation Center and Greenville SEED @ ECU, along with skilled faculty and facilitators, the outcome of I2I GO will provide greater success in identifying new product commercialization and license opportunities and increased potential for more start-up companies to 

ECU is located centrally in a 31 county rural region of eastern North Carolina consisting of many economically distressed communities. While ECU's student population of 29,000 students derive from throughout North Carolina and beyond, 50% of its students are from the region east of Interstate 95. This area has traditionally benefited from industries in support of agriculture, forestry and fishing. Textile manufacturing played a vital role in the economy but overseas labor drew away many of these jobs. Many of ECU's students find a lack of available jobs in their home towns once they graduate with newly acquired skills so they leave home to find jobs elsewhere. For these reasons, much of ENC has faced declining populations. Eight of 31 counties in this region have experienced negative population growth of 15% to 33% and thirteen other counties have growth of 0% of -14%. These factors directly affect the pipeline of ECU students who are forced to find employment while attending college. 71% of first year ECU students report the need to secure part time employment while attending college. ECU's vision of success for the I-Corps Site is to build an innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem that will generate jobs for every student growing up in eastern North Carolina. The partnerships established by I2I GO will have a direct effect on the growth of new businesses and jobs throughout eastern North Carolina."

Students will be recruited from EMU and neighboring institutions to conduct research on fruit flies (Tephritidae), which are among the most damaging horticultural insect pests worldwide, constituting pest management issues, trade barriers, and invasion threats for Australia, the U.S., and throughout the tropics and subtropics. The results of this research will have an impact on integrated pest management, which is a critical component of sustainable agro-ecological systems in the U.S. and worldwide. With good cause, the public is becoming increasingly concerned about the health and environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides, and their use is becoming highly restricted. The T-MARC-BIO program will add to the toolkit of effective, long-term strategies for both pest control and monitoring of invasive species, while minimizing the impacts of pesticides on human and environmental health. American students will gain valuable research experience through conducting projects in the multidisciplinary settings in Australia, as well as the life-changing learning, interpersonal skills, empathy, and global awareness that come from living and working in a foreign country. T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.

Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project intends to design and develop an innovative medical device solution that can potentially save $1.16B to the overall US healthcare system by reducing the procedural time and decreasing the number of catheters and devices used in Peripheral Vascular lnterven6on procedures. Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease affects more than 8 million people in the United States alone. The annual healthcare expenditure spent on treating peripheral arterial disease is $4.37B. Since 2008, US Center for Medicare and Medicaid has been stressing for greater efficiency and lowering costs for Peripheral Vascular Intervention. Commonly performed Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures in the CathLab, to treat PAD, encounter loss of guidewire access. This complication is amplified in the case of difficult to cross stenotic lesions and, in many cases, is frustrating for the physician as they have to spend several hours/procedures trying to regain guidewire access. Guidewire access is the key for a successful procedural outcome. The Project intends to reduce Peripheral Vascular Intervention cost by improving procedural efficiency by eliminating guidewire/catheter exchanges in current practice thereby reducing Cath Lab overhead costs and by reducing procedure time and effort required to acquire a good quality angiographic image. An important ancillary benefit of the innovation is that the radiation exposure to the healthcare providers and the patient can potentially be minimized due to the decreased fluoroscopic activity. The project aims to continue beyond SBIR Phase I to become a commercial product and be the standard of care for Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures.

This SBIR Phase I project is for the design and development of a .014-inch guidewire compatible low profile PTA balloon catheter with a proprietary contrast injection mechanism. This product is ideal for performing PTA interventions in difficult anatomical spaces e.g. below-the-knee peripheral vasculature. The proprietary inflation and injection system allows for treatment visualization without needing catheter exchanges or loss of guidewire access. The output of the Project intends to provide focused and sharper visualization along the entire treatment length and allows for judicious usage of radiopaque contrast in contrast sensitive patients. A feasibility prototype of the concept was tested in an animal model with promising results. The SBIR Phase I project is focused on overcoming technical challenges to design and develop the unique device design to maintain a statistically significant rated burst pressure, develop and evaluate device bond joints per ISO standard 10555-1 2013, Sterile Single Use Intravascular catheters, develop the manufacturing process and tools, to integrate the catheter multi functionality. The Project intends to design and fabricate a test fixture to simulate clinical usage of the Innovative device per FDA Class II Guidance Controls for Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Catheters and confirm that the catheter satisfies customer requirements. The Development efforts as part of SBIR Phase I project involve utilization of iterative design process. 3-dimensional design modeling and optimization, creation of a test fixture to simulate clinical usage, iterative prototyping and testing efforts to ensure the desired device specifications are met.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

During the exchanges, students will participate in collaborative projects directed towards developing new approaches to making molecules in a streamlined and sustainable way. These new approaches will have impact on modern medicine and manufacturing, including drug discovery and materials science. This proposal builds upon a previous NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program and provides the exciting opportunity to capitalize on the collaborative bonds already established to grow a truly diverse and globally prepared next generation of scientists that benefit from an integrated and successful global research collective. The overarching scientific theme that brings these international teams together is C-H functionalization, a science that is at the leading edge of academic chemical research.

The aim of this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal is to establish a vibrant training environment for collaborative global research in the general field of C?H functionalization. This will be achieved by means of a productive international research collaborative, the Global Institute for C-H Functionalization (GICHF).  This program will involve student exchanges and collaborations between the CCHF and three major international centers in the general field of C-H functionalization.  These centers are the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI)-funded Institute for Transformative Bio-Molecule (WPI-ITbM) at Nagoya University, Japan, the Institutes for Basic Sciences-funded Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations (IBS-CF) at KAIST, South Korea, and the Photocatalysis Center based at the University of Regensburg, Germany.  Each year a cohort of CCHF students, consisting of 3 graduate and 5 undergraduate students will perform 8-12 week exchanges between May-August with the international partners. The CCHF will also host international students, funded by the international partners, to ensure reciprocity in the collaborative exchanges.  Programming throughout the year will be in place to prepare the students for the research exchanges and to ensure they make the most of these experiences. The experience will include a GICHF annual meeting, which will be hosted, on a rotating basis, at one of our international partners. The annual meeting will serve as an opportunity to bring together the entire student cohort as well as faculty from the United States, for a week-long brainstorming, community building, and educational event with our international partners.

"abstractText": "There is a growing awareness of the need for multi-center clinical databases and multi-institutional analyses of healthcare data to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of research findings. Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.

This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.

By taking advantage of the enormous amount of information being created about our environment, through the confluence of real-time, mobile and wearable devices and the availability of rich social media data on patient behavior, the team will create a detailed and comprehensive picture of a patient's health, and a tool to help manage patients' engagement with their health care providers. The system has four key aims to: (1) provide a human-centered approach for integrating electronic health record data generated by traditional methods with data collected "in the wild" (such as personal fitness devices, mobile phone usage, local weather, pollution or even fast food restaurant maps, etc.); (2) develop a framework for deciding which data sources are trustworthy; (3) create a cloud-based system to allow users to view and track their own data over time and improve healthcare outcomes; and (4) provide educational outreach and community participation, particularly in minority populations, to design a system which benefits users in both the short term (through employment and education) and the long term (through increased engagement and trust).

This project will leverage modern distributed cloud-based computing infrastructure (including mobile phones and Amazon Web Services), and the unique capacities of the South BD Hub to house and analyze the enormous volumes of health-related data that are generated every day by people, and their environment. By linking electronic medical records, external databases and data 'in the wild' harvested from patient's Internet-enabled devices, the project will address several issues related to the integration of high-resolution data for longitudinal tracking of patients. These include acceptability of the technology, particularly by vulnerable groups, usability, veracity of data collected, and scalability/integration across a large heterogeneous landscape.  By employing patient-centric agile development, the team will work with communities to implement a cloud-based architecture to improve tracking of study participants, increase the ease with which data can be captured, improve patient engagement, and facilitate care coordination. The resultant platform will integrate big data analytics, real time scalable data collection, and social media analytics on patient behavior to analyze cardiovascular disease outcomes among disadvantaged African American and Hispanic patient populations.  Additionally, the team will implement data fusion techniques to ensure the veracity of the varying qualities of data collected, and develop machine learning models to identify at-risk patient populations in order to reduce health disparities. Finally, patient engagement and health outcomes will be measured to assess the validity and success of the system."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting autoantibody markers for research and clinical diagnostics. Precision medicine requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA barcoding technology for improved antibody detection with increased analytical sensitivity and multiplex power to detect more at the most clinically useful time. Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant autoantibodies that are refractory to common techniques like ELISA.  This platform has the potential to accelerate the development of lifesaving diagnostics across a broad spectrum of human diseases. 

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect crippling diseases at the most favorable time.  The Phase I results showed the expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection of antibody biomarkers. The Phase II objectives are: 1) Validation of the multiplex ADAP assay for clinical diagnostics serving autoimmune connective tissue diseases, thyroid disorders and celiac diseases; 2) High-throughput automation of multiplex ADAP assay technology for clinical diagnostics; 3) Manufacturing of assay reagents and establishment of quality control standards; and 4) Demonstration of the applicability of multiplex ADAP for a broader set of antibodies. The intellectual merit of this project resides in the achievement of 10,000x increased sensitivity, and 20-30% increased specificity at multiplex while having the option to use existing PCR reader platforms to help keep lab capital costs low.

For instance, a viable regenerative braking energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of CO2 emissions. 

This STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing "Graphite - Inherited" paradigms regarding fast rate in anodes would be done away with, or substantially redefined with the proposed approach for designing high power lithium ion batteries based on an inexpensive hemp-derived carbon nanosheets and nanostructured manganese oxide anodes. A much clearer understanding of the synthesis - structure - property relations in such nanocomposites will have wide-reaching scientific and technological implications. Research and development activities will focus on structural optimization and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial pouch cell form factors in order to demonstrate device-level performance and commercial viability of the proposed technology.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to rapidly engineer yeast for production of fuels, chemicals, enzymes, and other valuable molecules. Yeast offers high value production capabilities; however, engineering new strains is very complex and expensive - costing approximately $75-100 million, and requiring 7-10 years for development with current engineering methods. This project will develop a genome engineering technology for yeast that can substantially reduce the cost and time for developing new strains for industrial biotechnology applications. This technology will increase the ability of companies to use yeast to efficiently produce high-quality products from renewable feedstocks, and help grow the overall industrial biotechnology market. 
 
This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains. Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast, and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency of the system and endow existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself. This project will establish a system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic features for MAGE in yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains for specific function."

The technology in this project is based on a chatbot that sustains ongoing, interdisciplinary conversations with each student. The platform is designed to provide middle school students with curriculum materials that expose them to authentic and engaging real-world problems that, over the course of weeks or months, come together to form a cohesive response to a project prompt. The goal of this project is to build and refine this new form of eLearning platform that has the potential to greatly improve engagement and learning outcomes, especially for low-income and minority students. This goal will be achieved by making the standards-aligned educational content meaningful and relevant to the interests of students and by catering the instructional materials to each individual student's skill level so they can move through the materials at their own pace towards mastery. To measure the impact of this technology on student outcomes, this project will involve state-of-the-art efficacy research in accordance with guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).


This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with developing a forward-looking education platform built around a chatbot that sustains long term, goals-oriented conversations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a decision tree architecture. The highly-customized chatbot is designed to make project-based learning scalable by empowering students to choose and customize their own project theme from a set of options, and then providing conversational explanations and practice questions that illustrate how Common Core standards apply to the student?s project. This research undertaking will involve developing and training custom neural networks to interpret student responses and questions. It will also involve developing algorithms that correctly identify each student's level of reading comprehension and, independently, conceptual understanding. With an understanding of the student's level, another algorithm will be developed that selects the appropriate materials and resources at the student?s reading comprehension level. These algorithms will be refined through user testing and a preliminary study of the efficacy of this education intervention will be tested in a correlational study with statistical controls.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study."

A core aspect of Internet operational viability is switching speed of optical devices at various points of the transmission, storage, calculation, and access chain.  Current technologies are not poised to be able to meet the speed and stability needs of the projected growth in Internet data volumes and access speed requirements.  These are currently growing well beyond a Moore's Law pace.  Needed is a disruptive approach to optical switching that will allow data management to keep pace with market needs.  Ability to delivery this essential capability will provide not only essential international leadership in internet services, but also avail companies involved in the innovation to make a substantial commercial impact directly for their shareholders and to those of their partners and affiliates.  

This Small Business Innovation Research phase II project is an effort to cross the chasm between fundamental new physics insights relating to the structure of matter and an aggressive approach to commercializing 'Semiconductors of Light' in an emerging market for high density optical interconnects priced for datacenters. Until recently, the only known photonic bandgap solids were photonic crystal structures consisting of regularly repeating, orderly lattices of dielectric materials. It was generally assumed that crystal order was essential to have photonic bandgaps. This longstanding assumption is now known to be false. New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations (hyperuniformity), include disordered structures that are isotropic. This means that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in conventional photonic crystal  and quasi crystal photonic bandgap materials is tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints. The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based photonic bandgaps will be generalized to a broad class of critically important photonic components by the application of a powerful new gradient-free optimization methods."

Inexpensive high-performance light filters allow for early detection of cancer and infection by bringing the highest-precision technologies such as fluorescence microscopy and sensing to portable, consumer diagnostic devices. They also make sensors in self-driving cars and other intelligent devices of the future to detect objects in the surroundings more accurately by eliminating the undesired light noise from the ambient and focusing on the target frequencies of light only. Batteries of future mobile devices may also last up to 20% longer due to more efficient light energy management in display units that become possible with low-cost, large-scale optical filters.?Finally,?the anticipated lower manufacturing cost at high volume will allow for more high-tech manufacturing jobs to remain in the US.

The proposed project will establish the technical feasibility of using a novel multi-material, micro- and nano-layered film production process in order to produce visible and near-infrared thin-film optical filters. The time and cost requirements of conventional, deposition-based production techniques of such filters are a significant barrier to market growth and commercial acceptance of their broad range of uses. In order to address this market gap, this project will investigate the elements necessary for consistent production of filters made of hybrid organic/inorganic materials using the novel process of thermal drawing. This investigation will cover methods of integration and handling of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in the thermal drawing process as well as understanding and controlling fluidic instabilities at interfaces to obtain filter uniformity and integrity. The results of the proposed research will determine whether the novel thermal drawing process, in conjunction with developed materials and handling techniques, can reliably generate high-performance visible and near infrared filters at scale.

By significantly improving the accuracy and timeliness of insect surveillance, we will allow more effective pest management, allowing the applications of insect interventions to be targeted in space and time. For example, rather than a blanket spraying of harsh pesticides across the entire field, our system could suggest spraying of a milder (and cheaper) pesticide in just a few "hot spots", at the optimal time of day. Reducing the volume of pesticides has further positive benefits to society at large, it will reduce pollution, and the use of pesticides has been implicated as a contributor to climate change and to colony collapse disorder. The hardware/algorithms/representations/data-models created in this project have an obvious application to mosquito surveillance, which has implications for control of insect vectored diseases of both humans and livestock. The commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is obvious. Insects damage or destroy about 150 billion dollars' worth of crops each year. If we prevent reduce this by just one percent, we have a billion-dollar market.

The proposed project will investigate techniques to improve the state-of-the-art in flying insect classification, with the goal of producing a platform that allows insect surveillance for precision agriculture. In particular, we will take the current algorithms and representations (many of which were invented by the current PIs) and make them invariant to the wide range of conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity) encountered in the field. The company's research has shown that without creating such invariances, the variability induced by changing environment conditions will swamp the regularities in the features that are currently exploited by classification algorithms, and reduce the accuracy to random guessing. It is well understood how temperature, pressure, humidity effect air density, and how air density effects insect flight. However, the current models treat the insects as idealized objects using aerospace equations for density vs. lift and completely ignore the effects of the environment on insect physiology. The company plans to achieve this by creating a model that compensates for environmental conditions. To achieve these ambitious goals, they plan to use machine learning to learn the appropriate invariances and model corrections.

Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

Unfortunately, doctors have few good options for effectively treating this type of infection to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should the infection persist and spread.  Today, treatment requires surgical replacement of part or all of the existing implant while using oral or intravenous antibiotics.  Due to the capsule around the joint (isolated from blood vessels) these methods deliver marginal amounts of antibiotic within the knee where the bacteria reside.  Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without the use of their knee, waiting for the bacterial infection to slowly resolve.   ForCast Orthopedics' Antibiotic Dispensing Knee Spacer provides a refillable reservoir within the artificial knee that can distribute antibiotic directly into the knee capsule for effective infection treatment.  Physicians can prescribe the antibiotic most appropriate for the bacteria diagnosed.  The patient returns to the doctor's office once per week for a checkup and antibiotic refill injection until the infection is cured.  No follow up surgery is required. Duplicating the antibiotic delivery of previous successful clinical studies (using representative but intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced patient suffering and reduced healthcare costs.

This SBIR Phase I project addresses an underserved clinical need for improved treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI).  Today, doctors have few good options for treatment to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should PJI persist and spread.  All methods require surgical debridement and replacement of part or all of the existing implant (to reduce bacterial load) while using oral or intravenous antibiotics that cannot reach the remaining bacteria within the knee capsule (blood/synovial fluid barrier). Temporary eluting antibiotic spacers and beads are too short lived. Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without a load-bearing knee.  ForCast Orthopedics is developing an Antibiotic Dispensing Spacer (AD Spacer) to replace the standard spacer in a total knee implant.  The AD Spacer provides a refillable reservoir to hold the antibiotic of choice for the bacteria identified and a delivery system to maintain a therapeutic concentration within the knee for the entire therapy duration, typically a minimum of 6 weeks. As a permanent spacer, no further surgery is required after treatment.  Emulating the delivery characteristics of previously successful clinical studies (using intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced morbidity and reduced total cost of care.

Data is making modern cities and local communities faster and safer, as well as more sustainable, livable, and equitable. At the same time, smart city technologies raise concerns about individuals' privacy, autonomy, choice, and possible misuse. Government officials are raising important questions about who should own data, how privacy protections for public-facing technologies work, who and how to communicate with the public about privacy, and more. The long-term vision of the project is to help municipal leaders strengthen their ability to collect, use, and share data in a responsible manner. This will help grow privacy-preserving innovations across applications and geographic boundaries for the public good. In this way, the Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke will serve to increase public knowledge, understanding and engagement with privacy-related concerns, and ultimately promote the public's trust in smart city technologies and in their local government.

The Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke is a collaborative project led by the FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF). It will undertake three interrelated activities to help city/community innovators understand and incorporate privacy considerations and protections into smart city projects. First, the Spoke will produce a privacy risk assessment framework for smart city projects, including guidance on what policies, practices and accountability structures should be put in place and how to weigh benefits of new or expanded data techniques against attendant privacy and security risks. The framework will feature a de-identification component as de-identification is one of the primary measures that organizations can take to protect and share data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the Spoke will establish a network of privacy leaders for smart cities and communities, helping municipal officials better understand, communicate, and collaboratively address privacy issues and principles. Lastly, the Spoke will hold two workshops in partnership with MetroLab Network, a national network of 40+ city-university partnerships advancing technological approaches to urban challenges. The workshops will serve to launch the privacy leaders network; educate network members about the privacy risk assessment framework; and identify areas for further collaboration and research, particularly in applying the framework to specific technologies and data uses. Expected project outcomes include wide dissemination of the privacy risk assessment framework and its adoption in specific localities; development of new collaborations and partnerships through the privacy leaders network and associated workshops; and as an overall outcome, the advancement of civic leaders' knowledge, understanding, and application of privacy protection(s) toward standards of practice for smart cities and privacy. The project will support and leverage the Hub Network, in particular the South Big Data Hub, NSF's Smart and Connected Communities program, and the MetroLab Network of city-university partners.

Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration."

The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

The project is additionally intended to drive K-12 VR hardware adoption by providing a compelling and teacher-customizable solution that will justify institutional hardware investments. When proven scalable, the project will act as a beachhead for other VR and game-based learning entrants to bring their own innovative learning content into the K-12 ecosystem, simultaneously promoting the progress of science in alignment with the NSF's mission, as well as providing a broad economic lift to the American economy by unlocking a new market sector.

Players will be able to form hypotheses, build robots, test, and iterate, mirroring the processes of project-based robotics and maker programs. Beyond robot construction, the project will offer challenge courses that test players' ability to build to specification. Each course will require a different physics-based solution for which a capable robot must be constructed. For example, a course might challenge players to navigate a set of stationary obstacles and then place a cube on a pressure plate, requiring a robot with maneuverability and the ability to pick up, transport, and place objects. This task serves as a model of the underlying dynamics of engineering design: identifying a problem, thinking critically, and developing a solution engineered specifically to that problem. To establish this project in the larger context of teaching media, it will be developed as a desktop-only intervention, a VR-only intervention, a desktop/VR hybrid intervention, and a paper-based control intervention. These variants will be tested with middle school and high school end users to verify the efficacy of game-based VR as a pedagogy.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provides precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.

The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand the problems that the industry and federal agencies face during the operation of underwater vehicles for applications such as, ocean monitoring, inspection of coastal structures, rescue missions and/or hydrographic survey. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are key for multiple underwater missions including detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, ocean bed-floor, polluted water, as well as surveillance of coastal zones and coastal structures. In many circumstances AUVs are preferred over conventional towed instruments or marine surface vehicles because AUVs can get closer to the area of interest, they can cover large areas without constant monitoring or hover hazardous areas without putting at risk humans life. Although current AUVs have many capabilities, one main limitation is their inability to perform precise station-keeping which allows the vehicle to hold its position and adjust for currents. New technology in underwater propulsion will permit the development and control of a new generation of highly maneuverable vessels that have to operate in more challenging environments. The proposed work is expected to increase the partnership between academia, marine industries and national defense agencies. In addition, it will promote the progress of science and national security using bio-inspired technology.

This I-Corps project focuses in the propulsion technology and control strategy for AUVs that needs to operate in tight space, low-speed with high mobility and perform station-keeping missions. Bio-inspired undulating fin can provide multiple advantages including: superior maneuverability to control forward motion and directional maneuver with a single undulating fin; precise maneuvers suitable for station-keeping and maneuvers in tight spaces; reduce risk to get tangled in marine plants and ropes with less impact on the marine ecosystem; relative low speed with likely lower acoustic signature.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the product of a mobile, smart gait assessment system allowing for continuous gait monitoring outside the clinical settings, which can be used for online, remote clinical management for patients with gait disorders including patients with Parkinson Disease (PD). PD alone affects over one million people in the United States, a number that increases by 60,000 each year. This technology will support the prevention of re-admission by fall tracking and prevention, lower hospital visits and length of stay by allowing at-home monitoring of disease progression, implement monitored wellness programs, differentiate disease types by pattern recognition, and provide timely and efficient clinical management by tracking interventional outcomes. The patient customers will benefit by receiving recommendations on gait and posture habits, leading to a decrease in fall occurrences. Moreover, they will benefit from activity monitoring by receiving suggestions on exercise routines, which have been shown to increase health and fitness. On the other hand, clinics and hospitals will benefit from reducing the volume of patients at their facilities, and insurance agencies will benefit by decreasing patients' length of stay.  

This I-Corps project proposes a system capable of detecting asymmetry between kinetic and kinematic gait parameters, which consists of embedded inertial measurement units and insoles with piezoresistive pressure sensor arrays. With machine learning algorithms, the system can detect and classify the disease progression, which will support treatment modification along with normal disease course and symptomatic changes. This smart, non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical approach for disease prognosis could also lead to an increase in participation in clinical trials, as the low-risk involvement required could encourage persons with and without PD to participate. The developed technology allows for continuous gait recordings outside the clinical setting. This smart, wireless gait monitoring system has the potential of decreasing the burden associated with the numerous clinic visits. The intellectual merits lie in the use of emerging technologies, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence for feature extraction, classification, and rare-event detection. These features will support medical professionals' decision-making regarding the course of treatments from its early stages without having to add more effort to their already busy schedules. In addition, the designed Internet-of-Things (IoT) architecture will allow mobile health monitoring, including treatment compliance and categorization for treatment improvement.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide automatic prosthetic tuning technology that will enable the optimization of metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputee users. This product will simplify the process of tuning and will increase the performance of powered prosthetic legs to better assist users and provide more balance while maintaining a lower energy expenditure on residual muscles. Due to the product's user-friendly structure, it could easily be used in less-equipped environments, which will make the technology more accessible and eliminate the discomfort of long commutes to the prosthetic laboratory or clinics. This is a cost-effective solution for not only broader use of powered prosthetic legs, but also better efficiency of prosthetic laboratory and clinics to serve more prosthetic users. This will reduce the cost of maintaining powered prosthetic legs and, broaden the facilities that would offer these types of services. Also, since the system is automated a clinician will replace some of the tasks typically done by prosthetic experts, which is expected to reduce overall costs.

This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology. Lower limb amputees use prosthetics for daily walking; however, walking with prosthesis typically requires much more metabolic energy expenditure than people with normal gait. Current state-of-the-art technology provides powered prosthetic legs to better assist amputees. To have the best assistance and to increase balance, these legs require a meticulous tuning procedure. It is currently conducted using an observation-based approach by prosthetic experts; however, this approach is not accurate and lacks objectivity. The developed technology is able to wirelessly collect body area sensor signals and provide computational algorithms to automatically setup powered prosthetic legs, which provides a novel and efficient technique for optimizing the metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputees. This technology will enable an accurate and objective tuning for the users, which is cost effective because it may reduce the need for frequent prosthetic clinics for prosthesis adaptation. In addition, the objective and accurate tuning will maximize the use of powered prosthetic legs."

"abstractText": "International Research and Professional Development Experience for Students on the Ecology and Conservation of Wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar

The proposed research and professional development program will take place in Madagascar, one of the highest priority biodiversity hotspots in the world, with levels of endemism unmatched by any other country. The research goal of this program is to characterize the status of Nosy Be Island's endangered and charismatic terrestrial and marine species and identify the threats driving their declines. The research team of local and international researchers will train undergraduate students from the US and Madagascar to use a variety of wildlife research methods and social science surveys. Using these acquired skills, students will generate critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial species, including primates (lemurs), sea turtles, and dolphins. During this 3-year project students will, along with mentor, develop an understanding of the drivers of wildlife declines and design sustainable programs to protect them.  Science-based management is particularly important in Madagascar because terrestrial and marine ecosystems are experiencing alarming rates of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction in the face of food security challenges to local human populations. This project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries to adapt field methods to research questions in the context of generating cost-effective data to achieve sustainable conservation goals. Most importantly, this program will produce cohorts of highly trained scientists in the field of conservation biology with a deep understanding of real-world challenges.

Generating baseline ecological data on rare and charismatic endangered species is critical for conservation and wildlife management, particularly in data-poor areas where conflicts between human activities and biodiversity are acute. All research projects will address at least one of three objectives: (1) assess the critical habitats and density trends of six endangered flagship species, including three lemurs, one species of cetacean and one species of sea turtle, (2) investigate the environmental drivers of their abundance and their decline, and (3) assess the impact of potential mitigation measures. Each cohort of students (6 students per year) will base their research questions on the findings of previous cohorts, enabling us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes of decline and measures to preserve Nosy Be's wildlife. This research and professional development program has four stages: 1) pre-field training at Florida International University, 2) data collection in Madagascar, 3) data-analysis and reporting at FIU and 4) future-cohort input and supervision where students will share their experiences and support new cohorts. During field activities, students will be trained to 1) use standard methods to rapidly assess the conservation status of endangered species in the field and 2) use a combination of field and social science survey methods to conduct animal assessments. During class activities students will be trained to 1) write research proposals and field protocols, 2) use advanced statistical methods to analyze field data, 3) write technical and non-technical publications, 4) do oral presentations of their research, and 5) collaborate and mentor other students. Ultimately, this research program will provide critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar, and will provide students with key research and conservation skills.

Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

Currently, drug administration is predominantly conducted by manual handling and needle injection which is labor-intensive, induces stress and other ?white-coat? effects and is limited to simple drug release profiles. There is a need for advanced drug administration capability in animals that enables new complex dosing profiles, provides automation for chronic studies, and improves scientific validity. Technical challenges include the development of a low-power inductively-powered pump actuator, ten-fold pump miniaturization and wireless control of a large number of implanted pumps. The research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study.  Successful demonstration of the remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes, provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would not otherwise be possible. 


The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded due to inadequate drug administration.  Rapid and accurate evaluation of efficacy, safety and toxicity early in the drug development process is improved through the fully automated, wirelessly-controlled drug dosing technology supported by this Phase II project.  This project targets the international laboratory animal market estimated at $3.4B in 2012. Animal models are employed throughout the drug development pipeline and in particular, rodents are critical to drug candidate target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new drugs through automation. The controlled delivery of agents, including emerging biologics, siRNA, peptides, and small molecules, is an important capability in a multitude of clinical and preclinical research applications including neuroscience, pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology. More importantly, this project will enable drug studies that to be performed in a manner that will facilitate and enhance the translation of candidate therapies from animal to human."

This IRES project will support US students and provide international education, training and research in marine geochemistry and carbon cycling in a tropical estuary (Douala Estuary) in the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, West Africa. During this study, faculty and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound 1  in Cameroon. Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments. Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.

This IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model. Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research topics and graduate student theses. A goal of our IRES program is to attract underrepresented minority students and mentor them to develop self-confidence, independent and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in a research and in careers in the geosciences. By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

Carbon in estuaries are an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date, there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period, US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping) that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium) affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability of soybean cultivation. Soybean is the most widely grown crop in the United States with nearly 90 million acres under cultivation. Soybean is a key part of the food system and generates $22 billion in export revenue each year. One of the greatest threats to soybean production is the fungal pathogen known as Asian Soybean Rust. Current commercial soybean varieties have no resistance to this pathogen and over $2 billion is spent annually on fungicides to control this disease. While soybean is highly susceptible to this disease, many wild plant species have natural resistance to this pathogen. This project seeks to identify the naturally occurring mechanisms of disease resistance in wild plant species that can be used to develop disease-resistant soybean varieties. Adoption of these varieties is expected to bring more than $4 billion in value to the soybean industry while improving productivity and reducing fungicide use.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer disease resistance to Asian Soybean Rust, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. A key determinant of whether or not a plant is resistant to a particular pathogen is whether the plant has an appropriate immune receptor protein capable of recognizing the presence of the invading pathogen. Once activated, plant immune receptors trigger plant defense responses that typically result in immunity. This project will use reverse genetic and biochemical approaches to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer resistance to Asian Soybean Rust. Preliminary work identified several molecules from Phakopsora that elicit an immune response in non-host plant species. The goal is to identify the cognate immune receptors and test them for sufficiency to enable immune activation in response to Asian Soybean Rust elicitor molecules. This research will enable future work to the development soybean varieties with resistance to Asian Soybean Rust.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, entailing a technology based on chaotic system variability, is its ability to alter and enhance how people interact with music on and off line. By acting as a musical change agent, the proposed technology takes "personalized music" beyond playlists and song suggestions. For the first time, music listeners can bring their own creativity to the songs they care about. This project introduces a new paradigm for music where songs evolve and undergo transformation alone or with other songs, at the click of a button. The choice of music as an application for the technology is deliberate. Music is a highly context-dependent application where each note or musical event is determined by the preceding notes and events, and each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. That this advanced technique produces musical variations that can be analyzed as well as used for musical means suggest that the methodology could be applied to other sequences of context-dependent symbols, such as those that define image, text, film, and video. Furthermore, it can serve as an idea generator for media practitioners in general, as well as stimulate interest in engineering for students K-12 and beyond by linking science with the musical arts. 

This I-Corps project harnesses chaotic system variability to generate variations of a sequence of context-dependent symbols, such those that constitute a musical work. Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic behavior. Yet in its "chaotic regime", a dissipative chaotic system possesses a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to initial conditions. This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output. The variant output can be close to the original work, it can mutate beyond recognition, as well as achieve degrees of variability in between these two extremes. The method includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni}, the original elements sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,....,imax. For each "i", a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for modification or replacement, thus becoming a "receptor element". A substitution or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements by varying or replacing it with a substitution element. The resulting ordered set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output. A virtually infinite set of variations is possible, each unique.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project comprises the development of a wearable system capable of accurately tracking glaucoma progression via continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. Using a novel wearable system, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and medical professionals across multiple disciplines can review the IOP trends at visits, monitor high-risk patients in real-time, and program patient-specific threshold alarms that will prevent irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma and related conditions. Through successful product commercialization, the novel wearable blindness prevention system (BPS) is expected to be adopted by approximately 2 million glaucoma patients annually. Users of the device will have continuous access to IOP data trends. Clinicians will be alerted when at-risk patients fail to comply with prescribed daily medicinal treatment (due to excessive IOP levels) and can continuously track the efficacy of prescribed IOP-lowering treatments. Finally, the IOP tracking capability of the system will allow improvements in the quality of care for general clinicians, medical specialists, and clinical researchers and will be a major player in the current move toward data-driven, value care.

The intellectual merit of this project centers on laboratory feasibility testing of the fundamental concept behind the novel blindness prevention system technology - image-based pressure sensing - on a benchtop 3D-printed glaucoma simulator that is monitored using an alpha prototype of the system.  The research plan includes testing of the feasibility of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera which fits inside a pair of eyeglass frames, plus processor, optics, and software, as a way to record pressure changes in eye tissue in a benchtop environment. The key objective is to accurately - and with high repeatability - detect unhealthy eye pressure levels in the simulator using an alpha prototype, a-BPS, that communicates with a standard mobile device.  The target research outcome for the a-BPS is to successfully trigger a high-pressure alarm in a repeatable manner whenever eye pressure in the simulator exceeds a clinically-relevant threshold. It is anticipated that the Phase I research results will show successfully operation in 90% or more of the test samples. The output from the Phase I effort will be used as design inputs for a Phase II prototype, which will be wearable and will allow testing on humans.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful liquid separation technology with remarkable potentials for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that, in part, led to the DNA sequencing market.  A CE system with both optical and mass spectrometry detection will enable a deeper understanding of molecular dynamics governing biochemical processes, such as protein expression, deregulation, and interaction with other biochemical species, which could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetics, and neurodegenerative disorders. The proposed technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. It also will allow efficient routine proteomics analysis and other bioanalytical applications.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows high efficiency separation and characterization of several biochemical species including proteins. However, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of CE-ESI-MS has been difficult due to lack of robust, easy-to-use instrumentation, which has made adoption for routine applications uncommon. This research will develop and evaluate a novel CE-ESI-MS instrument for protein characterization. The proposed instrument will employ original innovations to overcome the limitations of the incumbent technologies and exceed their capabilities. A novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation will be developed to allow analysis from 1 microL or less sample volume. The nanoport will employ a fully automated design with less operator intervention. This will be useful for sample-limited applications such as in clinical analysis. In addition, the instrument will utilize a hybrid electrospray ionization interface for simultaneous optical and MS detection, which no existing technology offers. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination will represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. The proposed innovations will significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology using engineered bacteria to improve protein stability in two large markets: therapeutic proteins and industrial enzymes. Proteins used as therapeutics frequently have insufficient half-lives in human blood plasma, so that patients with chronic disease need to receive frequent dosings, often by painful injections. These burdensome dosing schedules result in high rates of patient noncompliance, with attendant poor responses and negative health outcomes. Therapeutic proteins with improved half-lives in blood plasma would permit relaxed dosing schedules, lowering costs of administration and improving outcomes by reducing noncompliance. This proposed technology focuses on improving the plasma half-life of a therapeutic for a chronic disease primarily affecting children that currently comprises a $4B global market. Similarly, industrial enzymes are frequently deployed in harsh environments that impair enzyme stability and activity. Endowing enzymes with improved resistance to destabilizing chemicals would enable their deployment in high-value environments that are currently prohibitive. The proposed technology will be used to stabilize an enzyme for application in a $730M segment of the personalized medicine market. If successful, this work would provide a platform for developing next-generation enzymes deployable in currently prohibitive environments. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to utilize a synthetic biology platform to create proteins with new amino acid building blocks that dramatically improve half-life and stability. Many proteins used as therapeutics or used as industrial enzymes are stabilized by disulfide bonds. These bonds break in the presence of chemicals called reducing agents that are found both in human blood plasma (destabilizing to therapeutics) and in solvents and buffers (destabilizing to industrial enzymes). Using a strain of engineered E. coli that can incorporate amino acids beyond the 20 standard amino acids into proteins, the goal is to replace disulfide-forming cysteine amino acids with selenocysteine amino acids that form bonds called diselenides. Diselenide-stabilized proteins maintain stability and activity in environments with reducing agents incompatible with disulfide-stabilized proteins. This project will produce a diselenide-stabilized protein therapeutic for a major disease class. Improvements to disulfide-stabilized therapeutics will be demonstrated by ELISA assays showing improved binding activity, and by cell-based assays showing improved therapeutic activity, after prolonged exposure to blood plasma. This project also will produce a diselenide-stabilized industrial enzyme to catalyze a critical reaction for personalized medicine. Performance improvements over disulfide-stabilized enzymes will be demonstrated by in vitro stability and activity assays in reducing conditions.

Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is as diverse as the laser technology itself.  Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.

The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing chemically cross-linked synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds. While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000 deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use of any additional agents.  
 
This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels, the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally evaluated for their ability to eliminate infections and biocompatibility.

CRISPR-based therapeutics have the potential to be next generation therapeutics, particularly for genetic diseases due to their ability to cut DNA with sequence specificity. However, this type of targeted genome editing has not yet been successfully demonstrated for human therapeutics with existing methods.  The translation of CRISPR-based gene editing to the clinic remains a significant unmet need and the most difficult aspect of translating CRISPR-based gene editing into therapeutics is the lack of safe and effective delivery methods to the target the tissues. Existing viral-based delivery systems have limitations that include immunogenicity, pre-existing antibodies against them, broad tropism, off-target effects, restricted DNA cargo packaging capacity, and manufacturing challenges. As a result, non-viral methods that employ synthetic materials are being widely investigated as potential alternatives. Developing non-viral delivery vehicles that can effectively deliver CRISPR components to target tissues will improve the ability to broadly use CRISPR-based therapeutics for many genetic diseases.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a non-viral delivery system for the CRISPR enzyme Cas 12a (Cpf1) for delivery to target muscle tissue, and, potentially, enable the development of a novel gene editing treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The approach involves proprietary CRISPR-nanoparticles that are composed of peptide PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP, which possess good biocompatibility and high gene editing efficiency with the potential to manufacture and scale up under GMP for use in clinical trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP can efficiently deliver Cpf1 RNP to the muscle tissue and can induce the expression of the dystrophin protein by deleting exon23 with a mutation. Under this proposal, the specific experiments will focus on improving the biocompatibility, stability, and muscle-targeting ability of the CRISPR-nanoparticles. The experimental plan is to synthesize various Peptide-PEG-PAsp(DET), followed by screening in primary myoblasts and reporter mouse system. This technology using CRISPR-nanoparticles will be the first example of a delivery vehicle that can simultaneously deliver Cpf1 protein and gRNA via intravenous injection and achieve gene editing.

The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to engineer loblolly pine to increase wood density (yield) by 20% with no additional land, water, or fertilizer use requirements.  With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

This I-Corps project develops a virtual siteless environment for clinical trials. This environment will reduce risks, accelerate trial recruitment using e-consent, aid in conducting multiple virtual follow-up sessions with trial participants without requiring their travel to trial sites. It will also enable collection of data continuously, through participants' wearable devices, web-deployable questionnaires and surveys, home based specimen collection kits or through home visits by a nurse or phlebotomists.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable personalized monitoring of sudden cardiac events and heart arrhythmia by combining a wearable device and cloud computing. The project will utilize a patented cloud-connected ring sensor for long-term on-demand Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Current ECG monitoring is a $4 billion dollar market. However no existing product can provide on-demand multi-lead ECG signals over long periods (over one month). Every year over 380,000 Americans die from heart attacks, of which one third happen outside a hospital, motivating a solution to a personalized cardiac monitoring device which can provide actionable diagnosis on-demand and is connected with physicians for quick intervention. This project will potentially enable a first-in-kind ring ECG sensor to serve this unmet need. This I-Corps project will support extensive customer discovery with cardiac patients, healthcare workers, cardiologists, nurses, and telemedicine companies.  In addition, through the NSF I-Corps Team program, two engineering doctoral students will learn important entrepreneurial skills such as the lean start-up model, go through an intensive and rigorous customer discovery process, and network with potential investors and partners.

This I-Corps project integrates wearable devices with cloud computing to enable personalized cardiac monitoring on-demand. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the innovation of flexible electronics based miniature ECG sensors and cloud-based informatics system. By integrating wearable ECG sensors and cloud computing, on-demand cardiac monitoring information can be shared with cardiologists and emergency physicians. A smartphone can be used to receive physician-suggested actions for early intervention. During this I-Corps project, the team will explore the market potential for cloud-based wearable biosensors at point-of-care settings for cardiac applications where long term on-demand monitoring is important. The project will involve an extensive customer discovery process with potential stakeholders, business model generation and potential partner identification.   More broadly, this platform technology is also applicable to other wearable devices and chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide industrial lubricant companies or automotive lubricant companies with a better understanding and a design strategy for new lubricant products, especially for high-loading, ultra-thin film lubrications. It has been predicted that three major economic areas are related to tribology and lubrication engineering -- energy, manufacturing and transportation. These three areas all follow a trend towards increasing the efficiency, in which lubricants or new lubricant formulations are a critical component in an intense competition to provide goods at the lowest costs. This market pressure will continue to create a demand for new machinery and new type of lubricants that can improve the efficiency of manufacturing operations. 

The project builds a bridge that connects research findings in the computational lab to the real industrial world. Commercial importance for the lubricant products is a significant energy and cost savings in many sectors and new enabling technologies. The project also provides a unique opportunity for students to practice computational nano-tribology and research commercialization training in the real world, benefiting the lubricant industry, environment, and society. 

This I-Corps project uses core technology and innovation of computational molecular simulations to understand and design new lubricant products. Synthetic base oils with different viscosity modifiers under high loadings are targeted. The project explores the commercial opportunity of simulation technology through collaboration with potential customer lubricant companies. So far the nanoscale mechanical behaviors of base oils in boundary lubrication are still not well understood. This project focuses on atomic-scale friction behavior of realistic lubricant oils with/without additives and develops new computational models to provide unique insights into the atomistic behaviors of lubricants under compression and shear in boundary lubrication. Through collaboration with potential industry customers, computational molecular simulations reveal the fundamental lubricant-surface interactions under extreme boundary lubrication conditions. This project creates a new frontier for the advancement in tribology and lubrication engineering while meeting current customer needs. In addition, there is a commercialization potential to attract industrial partners to develop the next-generation lubricants for industrial and automotive lubricant companies.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide consumers a promising solution to purify indoor air, decontaminate water, and inactivate environmental pathogens to prevent infectious disease outbreaks. Conventional strategies for pollution and pathogen control face great challenges of a high cost in operation, intensive energy consumption, and complicated and frequent maintenance. The project aims to advance a new technology and material, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), for pollution and pathogen control with reduced cost, energy footprint, and maintenance, and promote commercialization for diverse applications in both U.S. and abroad. g-C3N4 is a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst that can be synthesized from inexpensive earth abundant chemicals, and the material holds promise for a broad range of applications, including indoor air purifiers, point-of-use or point-of-entry water treatment reactors, self-cleaning and antimicrobial paintings/coatings by utilizing sunlight (a type of renewable energy) or indoor light. Moreover, the project will be the first to explore the potential market of g-C3N4 as a promising advancement for current commercial photocatalysts (e.g., titanium dioxide), accelerate the implementation of innovative materials for industrial, civil, and military applications, and enable a new sustainable strategy of pollution and pathogen control that will be beneficial for our societal development. 

This I-Corps project will advance the commercial application of visible-light-responsive g-C3N4 for indoor air purification, water decontamination, and antimicrobial applications in different environments (e.g., healthcare, food). The team has developed g-C3N4 with enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation and with excellent stability, robustness, and biocompatibility. The team has demonstrated g-C3N4 effectively degraded organic contaminants in water and inactivated pathogens in the form of planktonic bacterial cells and biofilms, under the irradiation of both simulated visible sunlight and white light emitting diodes. Reactive species for contaminant degradation and pathogen inactivation have been identified, and the mechanisms have been elucidated. The team has also initiated the collaboration with an industrial partner to fabricate antimicrobial coatings with g-C3N4 for both healthcare and food applications.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to eliminate the barriers to the trading of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and to further accentuate the environmental and sustainability value of green energy production. A broad societal benefit of a national market for RECS (NaMaREC) is the increased adoption of renewable energy technology through projects such as community solar and wind farms leading to reduction in carbon footprints. This benefit is higher when the increasing need for energy due to growing populations is satisfied with more renewable energy. Renewable utilities will benefit from NaMaREC since it will allow them to expand their consumer base and reach consumers that may be willing to pay more for the certificate. Nonrenewable utilities can use NaMaREC to source RECs from cheaper regions, thus reducing their cost of compliance. Ultimately, NaMaREC will provide an avenue to communicate the economics of renewable energy adoption to the public through extensive interviews of potential customers. This project will form partnerships that includes the academia, industry, and start-up ventures to launch NaMaREC. 

This I-Corps project seeks to develop an online marketplace named NaMaREC (National Market for Renewable Energy Certificates) for the selling and buying of RECs. A REC is a non-tangible, tradable energy commodity in the U.S. that represents proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from a renewable energy resource. Currently, there are isolated sellers or aggregators of RECs across the U.S. with trades that are neither harmonized nor integrated. The business thesis of NaMaREC is to harness the economics of scale in the aggregation of RECs in a national market. The underlying motivating value for RECs is that 29 states and three territories of the U.S. have a policy mandate that requires utilities to generate a certain percentage of their outputs from a renewable resource such as solar photovoltaic or wind technology by a target date. This mandate, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), may be satisfied by these companies either by building the requisite renewable energy capacity or buying RECs to satisfy the RPS requirements. Isolated transactions of RECs have limited their market viability and accessibility by firms to meet their state-level RPS. NaMaREC will transform the trading of RECs in an integrated service that does not currently exist.

The broader applications of the proposed software system for analysis of sequencing data will also include tracing cancer development and analyzing its potential to grow, mutate, and resist treatment. The proposed software system will be integrated into laboratories' pipelines for clustering and assembling sequencing reads into complete genomic sequences. The proposed statistical algorithms will analyze the sequencing data more accurately which improves sequencing quality without an increase in sequencing depth thus further reducing sequencing cost.  The proposed software system will attract epidemiological and medical laboratories by more accurate analysis and cost reduction of high-throughput sequencing.

This I-Corps project deals with growing demand for powerful computational tools for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Existing software tools can successfully extract different sequences form the same sample but, in many applications, (such as an investigation of outbreaks of infectious disease, cancer research, and genome-wide association studies) it is necessary to distinguish multiple distinct yet closely related genomic sequences. The main obstacle for such studies is a high sequencing error rate and short length of reads produced by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The proposed software system can overcome these obstacles by using statistical algorithms capable of sorting out the sequencing errors delivering complete genomic sequences and accurately identifying point mutations distinguishing closely related sequences.

"abstractText": "This project by the Georgia Tech I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node called I-Corps South. I-Corps South Node brings together the Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) as the lead institution, and the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the University of Tennessee Knoxville as partner institutions. I-Corps South will introduce the labs, colleges, and universities throughout the Southeast to the entrepreneurial education, ultimately increasing commercialization outcomes in each of the participating states. The I-Corps South Node will reach more than half a million graduate and undergraduate students, and many thousands of the nation's research faculty.

This project provides I-Corps training and infrastructure to share the model I-Corps curriculum with regional affiliates. The primary institutions of I-Corps South will leverage their extensive industry relationships, partnerships, mentors, and funding connections to bring economic development through startup formation, workforce development, and entrepreneurial education. The Node will serve its region's research universities and HBCUs via a robust affiliates program. The I-Corps South Node's research contribution will lead to an understanding of how NSF-funded teams can be better supported to commercialize inventions, and uncover why some academics choose to become entrepreneurs, while others do not participate in commercialization activities. I-Corps South is also creating a pilot program to create an intelligent support system for I-Corps instructors, built upon IBM's Watson. 

This project's planned activities will expand the I-Corps curriculum repertoire for effective entrepreneurship training, creating a long-lasting impact on the region's teams and entrepreneurs. Its geographically dispersed collaborative network of Sites and affiliates will accelerate the development of the South's entrepreneurial ecosystems, and provide for increased partnership opportunities between academia and industry. The recruitment of new national I-Corps teams will increase the impact of the federally funded research. Finally, its focus on underrepresented minorities through programs at HBCUs and in Puerto Rico will increase the participation of those individuals in entrepreneurship, improving their well-being and inspiring future generations to pursue research and job creation activities, a clear and substantial benefit to society."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will make cutting edge cell therapies more affordable and accessible for a larger patient population. Cell therapies are among the most promising treatments for life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and severe immunodeficiency. While these cell therapies have been recently FDA approved, they remain extremely expensive, with single treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Manufacturing cell therapies requires expensive reagents and facilities and highly skilled labor, which drives up healthcare costs and makes cell therapies unattainable for many patients in greatest need. This I-Corps project aims to revolutionize the field of cell therapy manufacturing with an innovatively low-cost cell processing technology. This approach can efficiently modify normal cells into potent cell therapies and isolate desired cell populations for quality control. It benefits from low cost operation and eliminates the need in expensive skilled personal. This technology has a great potential to usher in a new era of affordable cell therapies and cost-effective healthcare.

This I-Corps project utilizes a microfluidic platform that can sort and engineer cells with little to no impact on cell viability and function. Instead of relying on expensive and dangerous methods such as viruses or electric shock, the approach relies on natural cell response to rapid compressions to cause the processed cells to uptake molecules that can turn cells into life-saving cell therapies. This uptake can also be used to deliver labels to the cell interior to indicate desirable or undesirable cell traits for an easy and rapid readout for quality control. The entire technology is housed on a microfluidic chip that can process over 100,000 cells per second. The technology for cell sorting makes use of inherent cell mechanical properties and does not require any additional chemical or biological cell modification. This microfluidic platform can perform tasks that are normally extremely complicated, such as cell engineering, cell labeling, and cell sorting, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for both making cell therapies and processing them into safe, high-quality treatments.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures by sensing the radio frequency (RF) signals during interventional and diagnostic procedures. During interventional procedures, especially critical for children who cannot be imaged using X-rays, this sensor provides the location and orientation of devices, such as catheters, inside the patient's body to guide the physicians. Since an acousto-optical sensor is used, this information transfer is achieved with no adverse effects, such as RF heating. During diagnostic procedures, the sensor can help quantify the RF field exposure of the patient in real-time, preventing excessive tissue heating. Furthermore, it may enable imaging of patients with medical implants who are not currently imaged by MRI due to safety concerns. As a commercial product, the sensor will potentially decrease the costs for all the stake-holders within the health industry (hospitals, insurance companies, governmental institutions, etc.) while decreasing the risk to the patients and improving health outcomes.

This I-Corps project is based on a radio frequency (RF) safe acousto-optical sensor to locally measure the RF field in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which in turn provides the signals to track the interventional devices like catheters and needles during interventional procedures under MRI as well as to measure RF energy exposure of the patient. The main safety concern with MRI is RF heating due to metal cables required to carry the signal from an antenna to the outside system. The solution here is replacing all the metal cables with optical glass fiber, which eliminates the RF heating. To convert the RF signal into optical modulation, a compact acousto-optic sensor is used as an intermediate medium between the antenna and the optical fiber. This is achieved by exciting a piezoelectric transducer on an optical fiber with the RF signal generated by miniature MRI coils and antennas which in turn generates acoustic waves in the optical fiber. Since the signal is generated and transmitted over an optical fiber to the MRI system without any conductors, this eliminates the RF heating safety issue. The sensor prototype has been successfully bench tested and proof of principle for interventional procedures has been demonstrated.

We created a unique deep neural network, composed of both a convolutional and recurrent  modules, and trained the model on a unique set of 10,000 clinical polysomnography (PSG) results, the world's largest collection of clinical PSGs assembled to date.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around its simplicity and accuracy. The benefit for patients is to enable them and their family members to perform accurate home testing with comfort. Meanwhile, physicians would receive real time diagnostic information about their patients, leading to earlier treatment. For insurance providers and hospitals, costs are drastically reduced as outcomes improve and fewer resources and staff are required. Apart from the healthcare industry, our project would also translate well into the general population, where wearables and health tracking devices are becoming commonplace. Being able to review the framework of one's sleep, with an accurate depiction of multiple characteristics including sleep staging, appeals to the consumer.

While consumer voice-activated digital assistants have driven transformation in consumer electronics, this work has potential to drive a parallel transformation for non-voice auditory data by significantly reducing the human effort and computational resources required to analyze new environments.  In agriculture, this type of acoustic monitoring could result in a better understanding of animal well-being, more consistent and humane treatment of animals, and better overall outcomes.  For industrial and surveillance applications, it could facilitate prevention of and rapid response to problems or threats. 

This I-Corps project is based on technology that learns what normal conditions sound like for an environment, then highlights when potentially abnormal events or conditions occur.  If desired, these abnormal conditions can be tagged to enable the system to distinguish between different known conditions.  This technology has been developed and tested extensively over the past six years within the context of monitoring poultry production facilities.  In many environments ranging from a few birds to tens of thousands of birds, it has proven effective in highlighting anomalous conditions such as the presence of disease, excessive heat, human intrusions, lighting changes, and abnormal equipment noise.  The technology uses proprietary sparse coding based algorithms that are computationally efficient enough to run on edge hardware.

Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.

This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages."

Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled "Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.

Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French "Grandes Ecoles", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.

"abstractText": "An inherent feature of the modernization of America's electrical power grid is a rapidly emerging Big Data (BD) presence. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 allocated over $4 billion to deployment of new technology for grid monitoring, control and infrastructure protection.  This led to a dramatic proliferation in the use of Big Data across multiple operational domains such as generation, transmission and distribution, customers, services, and markets. A challenging goal is to convert Big Data in smart grids, which is overwhelmingly abundant and yet grossly underutilized, into new knowledge that can offer major improvements in the above mentioned domains of smart grid operation, including management of almost a trillion dollars in grid infrastructure annually and an increase in building energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020. The Smart Grids BD (SGBD) Spoke will build an action-oriented organization focused on developing the fundamental framework for BD integration and knowledge extraction for power system applications. This will enable the South Big Data Hub to meet the societal grand challenge of creating technological solutions that can fulfill the economic potential inherent in Big Data analytics in the electric utility industry, expected to reach an annual value of close to $4 billion by 2020. The Project mission is to complement, strengthen, and serve the South Hub regional priority areas. Moreover, the services of the Spoke will benefit and complement the other Hub regional priority areas dependent on a smart grid backbone for operational assurance and resilience, specifically the areas of Oil and Gas Production and Distribution, National Hazards (Coastal and Other Hazards), Materials and Manufacturing, Habitat Planning (Smart and Connected Communities, Transportation, Urban Infrastructure and Sustainability) and Education and Training.  

The significance of Smart Grids Big Data is in the diversity of its sources, growth rate, and spatiotemporal characteristics. Developing a fundamental framework for Big Data integration and knowledge extraction is a grand challenge since the science and technology are yet to be discovered and the theoretical framework established. The main objective is to create an organization that brings together a cross disciplinary capability from academia, industry, and government, thereby (a) bringing  talent and resources from diverse Big Data areas to create an open access Big Data infrastructure that enables collaboration and innovation; (b) engaging industry to define its challenges and implement new Big Data technologies for cost-effective computational, analytical, and data management solutions needed to get the full benefits of smart grids; and (c) establishing close collaboration with the South Hub to find the most effective way to develop outreach, education, and training, thereby assuring the SGBD SPOKE domain integrates synergistically with the other Hub domains to advance fundamental data science and its impacts.   Achieving the knowledge extraction from Smart Grids Big Data will result in the advancement of fundamental sciences in multiple disciplinary domains related to Big Data analytics. It will also increase our understanding of merged data collected from the physical systems, thereby helping us better understand the flow of energy in the smart grids, and how this understanding can prevent emergencies, improve asset management, and increase energy efficiency. It will also provide a more illuminated understanding of behavioral analytics that addresses the human interface with smart electricity systems. The expected transformational outcomes are: (a) solutions to decreasing the grid outages, improving energy and market efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and engaging industry and customers in new business models to ensure industry growth, operational resiliency, and customer value, (b) a cross cutting research community focused on solving practical problems while concurrently advancing the fundamental understanding of Big Data issues; and (c)  engaging  novel instructional paradigms for educating and training the next generation of Big Data experts  nationally and globally."

"abstractText": "Protecting the environment is among the biggest challenges facing our society. As the effects of environmental degradation, global warming and climate change continue to grow, there is an increasingly urgent and critical need for research and education in biological diversity, ecological modeling and environmental sustainability. On one hand, professional and citizen scientists need ready access to large-scale biological, ecological and environmental data for modeling, simulation and analysis. On the other, college teachers and students in biology and ecology need to access large-scale data in a form meaningful to them. The various audiences will engage with big data in different ways and so a variety of knowledge-building tools are needed. This project brings together two dozen scientists from a dozen institutions in academia, government and industry to address the problem of translating big data into meaningful knowledge in support of research and education in environmental sustainability.  

Encyclopedia of Life  (EOL) is the world's largest database of biological species and other biodiversity information. EOL also works closely with scores of other biodiversity datasets such as BISON, GBIF, and OBIS. This project seeks to make EOL and related biodiversity data sources accessible, usable, and useful, by integrating extant artificial intelligence tools for information extraction, modeling and simulation, and question answering. The focus of this project will be on the data engineering required for this integration and construction of a resulting EOL+ system. The project team will provide access to EOL+ such that users can build their own tools and services on top of EOL+. The team will work with the NSF South Big Data Hub to organize yearly workshops for building and supporting a community of users of EOL+. Professional and citizen scientists, and teachers and students alike, will be able to access EOL+ through NSF's South Big Data Hub webportal, and use it for modeling and analysis, explanation and prediction, as well as education and workforce development in biological diversity, ecological modeling and environmental sustainability."

The proposed International Research Experience for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies - Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech -  ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?) aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental, imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation techniques. The ?CGPET-  ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors, who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations; similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period at Georgia Tech. 

Broader description. 
Fundamental understanding of soil, rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies, IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research, which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge, expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research institutions around the world."

The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to disrupt the 1000 hours per child per year where American children have no school and no parents and deserve access to the best enrichment activities. The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints. The resulting system will be deployed to the company's users along with extensive evaluation of its efficacy.

Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload.

Text-based searches have revolutionized the ability of people to complete tasks more quickly and efficiently as they are able to find the information they desire in an organized, compiled, and logical manner. Visual search provides the next level of disruption in search capabilities by allowing users to find information even more rapidly and accurately by using images. The deep learning-based software being developed will allow consumers to find products they are interested in, and co-purchase related products, quickly. Further, users will be more engaged through exposure to designer photographs of products (inspirational photography). By helping customers find exactly what they are looking for in a timely manner, user engagement and productivity will be increased. Further, related style-based recommendations will increase purchasing overall.  Increased spending stimulates economic growth by increasing taxable revenue by retailers, and through increased sales taxes generated from the purchases. 

This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project seeks to develop a visual search engine that is poised to disrupt retail and ecommerce by switching the focus from text-based to visual search-based exploration. The platform initially targets interior décor and furniture where deep learning techniques are trained to recognize products across a wide range of conditions. In Phase II, the software deep learning architectures will be generalized to enable a broader range of products, and to allow customers more control over design decisions and choices. A client-facing REST API will allow retailers, designers, and media companies to programmatically access functionality of the platform, and build their own user interfaces and apps on top of the deep learning technology. Lastly, it is proposed to develop a white-label app that can be customized for individual retailers who want to distribute this visual search capability to their customers.

Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism.

On a fundamental level, this project will enhance technological understanding of how to apply microfluidic technology concepts to clinically-relevant applications (requiring macroscopic flowrates) in a practical manner, while also establishing a new medical device sector centered on a suite of easily implemented cell separation devices for use in cellular therapies and related fields.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to employ a cell separation approach to create a high-throughput proof-of-concept prototype to help simplify and streamline the manufacture of cellular therapies.  To accomplish this objective, a two-stage microfluidic module will be designed to achieve isolation of separate lymphocyte- and monocyte-rich subpopulations from blood samples, while removing undesirable red blood cells and platelets, at levels sufficient for successful culture growth.

Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential.  This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US.

The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse.

Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications, where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury. The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments. Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and a unique commercial opportunity for the company. 

The intellectual merit of this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s) best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.

"abstractText": "This IRES project provides experiences for 4-6 undergraduate researchers from the University of San Diego and Harvey Mudd College to spend 8-10 weeks researching brown carbon formation by aqueous photooxidation of atmospheric phenolic compounds. Four weeks of research will be conducted onsite at Universit? Paris Est ? Cr?teil (UPEC), where the cohort of undergraduate researchers will closely collaborate with their international mentors on a series of CESAM aerosol chamber experiments utilizing advance spectroscopic methods. After returning from France, the undergraduate research team will focus on the workup, interpretation, and presentation of chamber data, while continuing to interact with international mentors via video conferencing. Each participant will be involved in the project for at least one semester prior and two semesters subsequent to travel for training and further experimentation at their U.S. campuses. In total, 15 undergraduates over 3 years will participate in this international project and will be mentored by French scientists while gaining hands-on experience with advanced research tools. 
This IRES project is focused on atmospheric chemistry and will contribute to the better understanding of clean air and global warming.

Phenolic compounds, which are produced during biomass burning and from the oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic precursors, are believed to be significant sources of brown carbon aerosol when oxidized in cloud droplets, especially in the presence of iron (from dust) or nitrogen oxides (from combustion pollution).  However, multi-phase reactions of phenolic compounds have been studied mainly in bulk aqueous solutions rather than in more realistic nanodroplets, where photobleaching can become photobrowning and where reactivity is often accelerated, especially for surface-active oligomerizing species. The researchers will therefore study brown secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by phenolic precursor species in nanodroplet "cloud simulation" photooxidation experiments at the CESAM chamber in Paris, characterizing chemical and optical changes in aerosol particles before, during, and after cloud events. Particle browning will be monitored by CAPS-ssa and UV/visible spectroscopy of water-soluble OA as the reactants interact with seed aerosol, water droplets, and simulated sunlight in the pressure, temperature, and RH-controlled chamber. Particle-phase chemistry will be monitored by aerosol mass spectrometry (ACSM-TOF), and particle uptake and outgassing will be detected by high-resolution PTR-MS and long-path FTIR monitoring of gas- phase species.  This project will provide 15 diverse U.S. undergraduates with international research experiences at a state-of-the-art cloud chamber facility as the center of a 3-semester research experience for each participant.  Project activities will increase understanding of important sources of brown SOA, which will in turn allow this pollutant, and the adverse effects on human health and climate that it causes, to be minimized in a more cost-effective manner.

A key objective is to close equity and opportunity gaps by equipping youth and their advocates with a data-driven, motivational career development solution - one that taps into existing initiatives and connects users to meaningful career-building experiences online and in their communities. The intended outcome is a web-based career platform that fosters career self-efficacy and increases knowledge of occupations and career pathways. The proposed platform consists of (1) an engaging app for youth ages 14 to 25 based on popular game mechanics; (2) a Web-based advocate (educator) dashboard that reports on individual and aggregate user career exploration and skill-building activity, and supports public and private organizations? need for visibility into youth interests and skills as a way to prioritize funding; and (3) an implementation toolkit, featuring 30+ lesson plans as well as professional development videos for integrating the platform in a wide range of formal and informal academic and advisory settings. This project's broader impact is to help youth foster career readiness and, thus, increase their likelihood of staying in school, finding good employment, and gaining greater social mobility. This increased career readiness ensures a pool of qualified applicants for employers in industries across the U.S. 


This project combines empirically-tested career development methodologies, proven game-based learning principles, and open big data about careers to provide personalized, accurate career guidance. The app engages youth in building personal profiles using visualized psychological assessments (based on validated inventories). A proprietary system then recommends Hats (careers) to explore and Ladders (activities) to complete that provide real-world learning supported by a range of motivators (level design, self-reflections, achievement badges, social sharing, and mentor communication). Data generated during Ladder activity and self-reflections strengthens the user's profile and, thus, the accuracy of the recommendation engine. The project employs design-based methods as the overarching research approach. A final evaluation of the completed program will be conducted in both high school and after-school settings. Career readiness, persistence, and perceptions of ability and of the H&L program will be assessed using quantitative methodologies. The anticipated result is a highly effective career development program that engages 21st-century learners with foundational career-building experiences. Students will be able to identify career aspirations, based on interests and occupational data, and gain greater confidence in their ability to navigate and adapt to changing career pathways.

Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

With high energy density advanced materials, these devices can store significantly higher electric power per single charge. Particularly, rechargeable batteries with significantly higher energy density will improve; the range of electric vehicles on a single charge, operating time of defense platforms (such as aerial drones, naval vessels, exoskeletons, communication devices, etc.), amount of renewable energy stored, battery life of medical devices, and the need to charge consumer electronics less often.  In addition to improved performance, high energy density devices will accelerate commercialization, adaptation, and sale of new vehicles or devices that utilize them. In turn increasing investments and revenue not only for the advanced material and battery producers, but for companies involved in manufacturing and sale of electric vehicles and devices within the United Sates. 

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the production of novel, pure graphene anode material by Chemical Vapor Deposition technique using readily available material resources. Currently, graphite anode-based LIBs are the most commonly used and the most reliable energy storage devices for portable electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid storage due to their stability, low cost, and safety. However, graphite's low capacity (theoretically, 372 mAh/g) prohibits the development of higher energy density batteries. The problem is that graphite's internal structure limits lithium diffusion within interlayer spaces. We propose to replace graphite as the anode material. Our material is a newly-discovered high-quality graphene network, consisting of incommensurately-stacked multilayer graphene (IMLG) assembled in three-dimensional (3D) form. It exhibits unique structural and electrical properties that enable the reversible intercalation of large amounts of lithium within interlayer spaces of multilayer graphene. IMLG anode exhibits an extremely high reversible capacity of up to 1500 mAh/g tested as an anode material in LIB cells. Within the scope of this project we plan to scale the production of this material, while maintaining high quality, and supply IMLG to industry partners for integration testing in commercial batteries.

There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product."

Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity."

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Howard University I-Corps Site is a novel partnership involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), with assistance from the DC I-Corps Node, a regional I-Corps node supporting the DC-MD-VA region. The partnership supports enhanced participation of HBCU students and faculty from Howard and Hampton universities in technology transfer and venture creation by leveraging DC I-Corps' expertise in the Lean Launch Pad philosophy and curriculum. DC I-Corps benefits from the Site's regional alignment to accelerate the participation of African-Americans in future I-Corps Node cohorts thereby enhancing diversity. I-Corps activities on each campus and assessment of these targeted programs also informs strategies for improving innovation and entrepreneurship interventions aimed at under-represented minorities (URM) and enhance ongoing educational research.

These institutions are uniquely positioned among the HBCUs to undertake this effort. Both institutions are among the inaugural cohort of HBCUs participating in the HBCU Innovation and Entrepreneurship Collaborative (IEC) organized by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) to stimulate innovation activity on HBCU campuses. The IEC effort connects HBCUs with best practices to implementing entrepreneurship and innovation activities on campus. These best practices are based on models advocated by Stanford University and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA - recently renamed VentureWell), among others. 

The partnership between the Howard and Hampton University Site and the DC I-Corps Node allows for greater opportunities to assess diversity as a variable in innovation and entrepreneurship programming interventions targeting under-represented minorities; enhancing fundamental understanding of effective frameworks for LLP education for diverse populations. Additionally, the Site seeks to increase technical entrepreneurship participation among the HBCU faculty and students by focusing on the following activities:

1.	Increasing the training of HBCU faculty and students in Lean Launchpad methodology.
2.	Developing a strong inter-related network of HBCU entrepreneurs with the NSF I-Corps system.

To control this epidemic, the President?s 2019 Budget Request called for $30B in federal funding to combat illegal drug use, presenting a commercial opportunity to disrupt the existing market for conventional color test kits and Raman-based testing systems. Numerous interviews conducted with LE and forensic supply resellers demonstrate a readiness to adopt a new technology to replace drug test kits currently in use. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit field use data analysis, which will help remove dangerous drugs from the streets. This innovation will also enhance the understanding of the chemical and photoluminescent properties of narcotic drugs reacting with various drug-indicator materials such as copper(I) iodide and validate the use of such information to identify suspected drugs. This is a wireless technology for the LE market sector, with the potential to eventually expand into the medical diagnostics and environmental analysis markets.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel system for on-site field drug testing for LE. Conventional chemical-based color tests are outdated and highly flawed, causing issues for end users and the rest of the drug enforcement ecosystem. These issues include false positive drug tests and the lack of ability to identify new drugs that are introduced into U.S. communities each year. Superior testing methods such as handheld Raman devices are too expensive for LE agencies to widely adopt, thus a low-cost technologically-innovative solution is necessary. This innovation leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in four main components: a handheld spectrometer, a drug-sampling device, a mobile app with a matching algorithm and access to a cloud database of reference drug standards. The goal of this phase I project is to achieve a high-fidelity Minimum Viable Product drug testing system. The investigation of alternative fluorescent drug-indicators is anticipated to result in novel methods for drug identification with high selectivity and sensitivity. These methods will be implemented into a drug-sampling device. As a part of software and hardware optimization, beta testers within LE will help identify system shortcomings and provide input to develop enhancements for usability and ergonomics.

The high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a significant impact on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, from the development of new protein-based drugs to quality control monitoring and biomarker discovery to clinical diagnostics. All proteomics applications require robust, repeatable and automatable sample preparation methods. Currently, however, these methods are not standardized. The lack of the standardization often leads to experimental failure and unreliable results, which may require many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money. Standardized protein sample preparation kits will provide significant workflow savings, improve time to market, and accelerate biomarker discovery and drug development.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a universal peptide isolation kit to serve the diverse needs of the proteomics community.  Currently, methods for sample preparation typically have more than a dozen steps, are prone to peptide loss and bias, and require more than a day to complete.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, it was discovered that more than 70% of researchers in academia and industry are unhappy with current protein sample preparation methods.  To address this need, a sample preparation kit that increases the speed and efficiency of peptide sample preparation was developed. The approach differs from current methods in three fundamental ways.  First, all manipulations will be done in solution in a single tube with half the number of steps compared to existing protocols. Second, a fast, universal, and reversible chemical tag is employed rather than relying on physical separation, preventing sample loss or bias. Third, a stabilized derivative of trypsin will allow for complete digestion of protein samples followed by efficient removal of intact and fragmented trypsin, preventing contamination.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from developing technology to enable enterprise, cloud, academic, and government network operators to cost-effectively scale computer clusters to support the growing demands on these systems. Computer clusters underpin an increasingly broad range of services that businesses, researchers, and society have come to rely on, from machine learning systems to online social media platforms. Companies increasingly use computer clusters to gain a competitive advantage and accelerate product development. Today's networking technologies improve in performance by a factor of two every two years, but the demand placed on cluster computing systems is growing more than twice that fast in some market segments. The technology developed through this project is well-positioned to exceed the cost and performance scaling limitations of current networking technology, enabling business and scientific end-users to find solutions to more complex problems more quickly.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a network interconnect for computer clusters that routes traffic through transparent optical switches. Optical switches remove communication bottlenecks in the network fabric but require fundamental changes in how distributed applications communicate information across the network compared to present-day technologies. The commercial success of the technology depends on its ability to accelerate the execution of common distributed applications while providing the interoperability, reliability, and manageability expected by network operators. This project aims to demonstrate a 2x improvement in the execution speed of network-bound applications compared to today's technologies. The proposed research to reach this goal includes developing and optimizing the software stack necessary to interface commodity applications with the fabric, quantifying the performance of those applications subject to the constraints imposed by optical switching, and optimizing the optical switch design to maximize application performance at a system level.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a novel arteriovenous graft that will minimize injury and decrease the probability of serious complications for chronic hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining therapy for patients suffering from kidney failure; it requires that blood be withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of the failed kidneys. This process must be performed at regular intervals and requires access to the blood with large bore needles. Graft failure complications, many directly attributable to  needle injury, cost the healthcare system billions of dollars per year and lead to significant morbidity and even mortality for patients. There are nearly 2.5 million patients with kidney failure who receive dialysis worldwide, and this population is growing at a rate of 8% per year. Currently, no technology on the market addresses dialysis graft needle injury or graft material degradation due to needle trauma. InnAVasc Medical's novel graft design has the potential to reduce complications associated with aggressive graft compression and inadvertent punctures, thus reducing adverse events and dramatically improving patient outcomes and quality of life while significantly reducing health care costs related to chronic dialysis graft injury. 

This project will substantially advance the development of an innovative device that will simultaneously allow for immediate cannulation following graft implantation (typical is to allow 4 weeks to heal prior to cannulation) and eliminate complications associated with repeated cannulation during maintenance hemodialysis. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to identify and engineer a suitable biocompatible material that will provide the desired mechanical strength to withstand passage of the dialysis needle into undesirable areas, while being sufficiently flexible to allow for optimal blood flow through the device and adequate conformity for patients of all shapes, sizes, and skin integrity. The first technical objective will focus on identifying candidate materials and testing their strength, flexibility and durability. The second objective will take promising candidate materials and develop prototype devices to assess manufacturability and performance. These aims will identify a suitable material that will enable the InnAVasc graft to be marketable to the broadest patient population. Successful completion of this project will provide a prototype device constructed of materials that will simultaneously optimize the desired ratio of mechanical strength to flexibility.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative imaging device that applies tactile sensing to the surface detection of vertebrae to help clinicians place needles for the nearly 13 million diagnostic and therapeutic spinal punctures performed in the United States each year. The standard of care involves manual palpation of the back to estimate a vertebral gap for needle insertion. This technique is highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple attempts, which lead to pain and complications, unpredictable procedure times, poor throughput, and high rates of referrals to radiology for fluoroscopic guidance. By offering an accurate means of localizing bony landmarks, this project will enable successful insertion in fewer attempts, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing costs across the $3.2 million market, including emergency medicine, neurology, anesthesiology, and pain medicine. The device can also be introduced for training and to reduce errors in clinical testing of intrathecal drugs; and can increase procedure access by offering an alternative, bedside solution for challenging cases. To date, tactile imaging has only been applied clinically to soft-tissue evaluations. This project will pave the way for expanded use of this low-cost, non-radiative modality; to possibly replace palpation for other procedures, such as joint injections and thoracenteses.

The innovation is the first standalone, clinical tactile imager. Its imaging subsystem comprises a sensitive, high-resolution pressure-sensing array, which detects vertebral landmarks when pressed against the back, and communicates them as a 2D pressure map to an integrated display. The device also includes a novel needle guide, which allows for flexible and reliable insertion. Positive gap localization has been verified in early development. This project will first confirm accurate insertion relative to imaging output by characterizing the relationship between guide and visualized-landmark locations, and by developing a mechanism to stabilize the device over unpredictable lumbar curvatures. Next, 2D pressure information will be evolved into an optimally robust and intuitive image. Advanced algorithms will be developed to detect, track, and highlight features of interest; and to understand and predict device use across cases. At each stage, the device will be tested on phantoms and through IRB testing on anesthesiology patients. Performance will be evaluated across anatomical variations, and compared with the standard of care. The resulting device will have demonstrated feasibility as a comprehensive spinal-puncture localization and insertion solution, rendering it suitable for further development and testing toward a regulatory submission, and providing compelling evidence for continued optimization in Phase II.

Such rechargeable batteries will allow cell phones to be charged to their full capacity within 20 min (rather than 2 hours offered by the current battery technology available in the market) while extending the usage time to 3 days (rather than 2 days of current technology) before recharge is needed. These ultrafast charging and high energy batteries can also find a market for other consumer products, such as cameras, laptops, drones, power tools, electric forklifts in warehouses, and military devices, to improve work productivity and life quality for consumers. Furthermore, Si-based high energy batteries can be utilized to reduce the cost and weight of electric vehicle battery packs by 60%. These advancements will pave the way for broad market penetration of electric vehicles and support a more environmentally sustainable mode of transportation. 

This I-Corps project employs a novel, simple and low-cost manufacturing method that can synthesize a new type of Si-based anode powder which exhibits unusual properties with ultrafast charging capability, high specific capacity and long-lasting cycle life. This new Si-based anode is termed as Si@void@C because it contains three distinct features simultaneously: (i) nanostructured Si building blocks, (ii) a conductive carbon shell outside the nanostructured Si core, and (iii) engineered void space inside the Si core. Together these three features offer the much-needed properties for Li-ion batteries: ultrafast charging capability, high specific energy and long-lasting cycle life. Based on these unique properties, the Si-based rechargeable batteries are designed in two general categories, one being "ultrafast charging batteries" that can shorten the charging time to 20 min while still allowing cell phones to be used for 3 days before re-charge and the other being "high energy batteries" which require 2 hours charging time, but allow users to recharge batteries every 6 days. Furthermore, "high energy batteries" can enable a reduction in the cost of the battery packs by 60% for electric vehicles, removing a critical barrier to consumer acceptance.

The Ecosystem is a software tool that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products, less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations). The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.  Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.  Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented. 

The project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible, yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS, correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases. The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited, generic learning objectives for engineering design."

The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

Only 22% of the United States? graduating high school seniors are proficient in science. This is important due to the estimated 2.4 million unfilled jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) in the United States, to provide higher-paying STEM jobs to citizens, and promote a scientifically literate citizenry. Recent research supports new approaches for how to improve this scientific literacy, and states across the country are adopting new science standards to support this effort. The outcome of this project will support development of students' scientific literacy with a novel approach which utilizes cooperative, interdisciplinary, problem-based learning within a video game. Commercialization of this product will transform the process of inquiry-based learning by putting the tools in the hands of student scientists as they test their own solutions. The project supports the NSF's mission by empowering students to develop strong science and engineering skills, as well as supporting development of 21st century skills such as collaboration and problem solving that are desired by employers. 


The technology developed by this Phase II project will produce a group problem-solving experience for up to five students to analyze a problem and implement an engineering solution within a live simulated environment, providing educators with a powerful curricula tool to engage their students in the real problem-solving cycles a scientist would engage in, within a feasible setting using the video game. The research goals include creating a flexible content authoring tool that designers and educators can use to generate their own unique scenarios and creating an easy-to-use educator dashboard to accompany it. The content authoring and customization options empower educators to reflect local context, student interest, and student background knowledge, strategies which are essential for educators of diverse populations currently underrepresented within STEM. The technology and its dashboard will also serve as a powerful formative assessment tool, enabling group assessment that is able to parse group and individual participation, and is designed to promote balanced group problem solving. The result of this research will create a uniquely flexible tool that will enable educators to engage learners in deeper, contextual learning, encourage transfer of information, cooperative learning, development of science and engineering skills such as data literacy, and be utilized for assessment of these skills.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the need to reduce the time associated with conducting tests currently used to establish targeted antibiotic (and dose) to treat infections.  Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at 30-50% of all hospital deaths).  To combat these high death rates, time is of the essence.  The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood of survival by roughly fifty percent.  This project combines electronics and microchannel fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility.  The project requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing.  The resulting product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually).  (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. 

This project uses Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the "bulk capacitance" (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease.  Using m-EIS to measure bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive, and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in approximately 4 hrs).  This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample, inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria.  Pathogen growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic.  The first products utilizing this system/method will focus on urine and positive blood culture broth samples.

Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)

fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing

Commercial potential is expected to emerge when replacing costly existing technologies (like quantum dots) with inexpensive materials able that can be embodied as highly fluorescent organic solids. Such materials are expected to create new value and have commercial potential in several markets in which either aesthetics, brightness, or color transmission is critical for performance. Our primary markets of interest are colorants in paints and polymers. Fluorescent brighteners represent an important segment of the global dyes and pigments market (a >$30B per year industry). We believe our technology can expand this segment by streamlining the formulation and processing of fluorescent materials, and by broadening the available color palate. Immediate applications would arise in creation of new fluorescent paints and coatings for construction and safety applications, and may also provide new user-friendly color options to the growing market for 3D printing materials. We anticipate additional downstream applications to arise in customized biolabeling technologies and solar power generation. If successful, the broader impacts also include the training of scientists in the process of commercialization. 

This I-Corps project provides a universal tool to address the outstanding intellectual challenge of understanding how to reverse loss of fluorescence from solid-state formulations of organic dyes. The intellectual merits will derive from new synthetic preparations of fluorescent dye and pigment technology by a method called small molecule isolation lattices, or SMILES. This project derives from research that has provided a way to insulate the color-carrying dye molecules from one another allowing their fluorescence to be rescued. A wide range of proof-of-principle experiments shows how to prepare the SMILES materials simply by mixing a proprietary compound with existing fluorescent compounds. The results show fluorescence in solids, as films, crystals, dyes, and particles under identical conditions that render conventional fluorescent dyes non-emissive.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the expansion of facial recognition technologies into the emissive infrared bands and the reduction of false negatives in the presence of large facial pose variation.  Visible 2-D image-based machine learning techniques dominate the commercial facial recognition landscape while heterogeneous facial recognition techniques including 3-D to 2-D matching and infrared to visible matching have not seen similar widespread commercial deployment.  The patented technology originates from an NSF Award and brings a crucial algorithmic component for commercial deployment that enhances heterogeneous facial recognition techniques while not relying on machine learning nor its concomitant large training database requirements.  This in turn opens up the potential for improved automated surveillance against a given watch-list deployable in a host of public and private spaces and under a wider range of surveillance conditions than currently possible using 2-D commercial matching algorithms.

This I-Corps project is a result of technology developed under an NSF Award which enables a radical improvement in 3-D facial recognition by reducing the computational costs for facial implicit surface generation and biometric capture originating from multispectral (visible and infrared) sources.  The technology results in robust recognition in the presence of large facial pose variation and occlusion using 3-D facial implicit surfaces.  The improvement over existing 2-D commercial facial recognition algorithms is evident under conditions typical of automated surveillance where large facial pose variation and poor lighting result in false negatives using conventional practice.  The method and apparatus for 3-D facial recognition underlying this research, however, performs equally well under large facial pose variation and is able to seamlessly integrate multiple band infrared input along with visible image input for vastly lower false negative facial recognition even in the presence of low-light and nighttime conditions.

"abstractText": "Biodiversity loss, climate variability, and pollution are major threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life. Addressing these human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems as they contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate regulation, and filter pollutants from water and air. Despite their importance, current policies are still largely ineffective as indicated by continued significant tropical forest loss over the past several decades. This NSF International Research Experience for Students award will support U.S. student projects across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda to analyze how international variation in environmental policies influences land use practices and how these practices affect conservation outcomes related to forest condition and primate biology. By examining similar forests with different environmental policies and different forests with similar environmental policies, we will be able to evaluate the largescale effectiveness of conservation incentives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, alongside the effects of agricultural practices linked to deforestation, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Through this research program, underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies and Makerere University Biological Field Station. Students will work closely with local field assistants and communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange. At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and host country scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences. An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure. Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods. 

Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities. Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation. Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks. However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas. As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives. Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations. Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1) To utilize international variation in environmental policies that integrate conservation and development objectives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, for an analysis of the effectiveness of conservation strategies for both protecting tropical forests and their primates and maintaining human livelihoods; and 2) To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences. To meet these objectives, 15 upper level undergraduate and early career graduate student projects will examine the extent to which differing economic and participatory incentives and agricultural practices influence conservation outcomes as measured by on the ground data collected on forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, biomass) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, and population size) across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda. At these sites, students will survey primate populations using line transects, quantify differences in primate behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays, conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, government officials and other stakeholders, and quantify forest characteristics using GIS and field methods. Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how these effects influence local perception of environmental policy. Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic and participatory incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes. As a breakdown in socio-environmental systems will negatively affect both humans and biodiversity, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually meeting their sustainability and conservation goals.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hypo allergenic peanut (HAP) variety, which is expected to save human lives by preventing allergy-related deaths, reduce the incidence of peanut allergy, and increase security, comfort and peace of mind for those individuals sensitive to peanuts and their families, extended families, friends, schools, and restaurants.  HAP also may reduce and/or eliminate the number of institutional lawsuits resulting from peanut allergy events, and reduce and/or eliminate the number of costly food recalls due to peanut contaminations. Reducing allergens may gain back the loss endured by the peanut market, improve the U.S. competitive edge on the international peanut market, and increase sales by 15% to 20% due to an increase market by restaurants, airlines and more. Food allergies cost the US $25 billion annually and peanut is a major contributor. HAP will provide a significant solution to peanut allergy with the potential to reduce the overall cost of food allergy.  

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to produce a commercial prototype for a hypoallergenic peanut as a solution to the serious health concern nationwide for peanut allergy. In previous work, a HAP was developed by concomitant silencing of the genes coding for the three most potent peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3. The HAP was 2 to 85-fold reduced in allergenic potency, and the HAP trait was transmitted to several successive generations in field trials. However, some of the transgenic peanuts were found to be chimeric and to produce non-homogeneous population of seeds with variable levels of allergenic potency. To solve this problem, repetitive somatic embryogenic tissue was used to produce first generation chimera-free HAP (T0 plants). During this Phase I project, the progeny T1 plants will be analyzed using Southern blot and quantitative PCR to confirm the chimera-free status of the plants. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, Western blot, sandwich ELISA and immunoCap assay will be performed to confirm the population of the progeny T2 seeds is homogenous and has undetectable levels of the targeted allergens. A commercial prototype variety for the hypoallergenic peanut will be identified and selected for further studies.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI.

This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a better and safer alternative to conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic instruments that use liquid-coupled transducers for the inspection of pipelines, tanks, and other structures used in power generation and liquid process industries. This new instrument does not require the use of liquid coupling, and can work on rough, coated, or contaminated surfaces that cannot be inspected with conventional liquid-coupled techniques unless the part is subjected to costly and time consuming part preparation. By not using liquids, this instrument can also be used on components that are very hot, very cold, radioactive, or in a vacuum. A high-resolution ultrasonic instrument that does not use couplant and has comparable performance to a piezoelectric instrument will save inspection time, reduce inspection costs, and permit inspections while in-service, which will result in millions of dollars in savings for plant operators. Society as a whole will also benefit from improvements in safety and performance of the plants, and by reducing the amount of waste and contaminants released into the environment as direct sub-product of the inspection, or from failures in facilities and equipment.

The proposed project consists of the development of a portable, high-resolution, ultrasonic phased array instrumentation, software, and transducers based on non-contact Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to substitute or complement the tens of thousands of conventional piezoelectric instruments in the market. For the instrumentation, the research will revolve around the development of a high-power and compact 16-channel pulser/receiver with a very small dead zone that permit inspection near the surface of the part. This instrumentation will also require custom software with signal-enhancing algorithms that compensate for the small amplitude of EMAT signals. The 16-channel phased-array EMAT transducers will involve multi-physics simulation of electrical and magnetic components to develop very small and high-density coil elements that can produce enough signal amplitude at high-frequencies while handling the pulsing rates required for effective inspection, and the high-power generated by the custom instrumentation. All these components will need to be enclosed in a battery-powered package that can be used in the harsh conditions typically found in field inspections. The expected result is a portable instrument that can compete in performance with conventional piezoelectric instruments, especially in applications and inspection environments where a conventional instrument is not practical or very costly to use.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on the design of the first completely automated radio frequency ablation (RFA) system for breast tissue. Of the  approximately 200,000 breast cancer patients in the US who elect lumpectomy annually, over 20% must undergo re-operation due to lack of clear margins. Furthermore, many breast cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately, performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins. However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   

The proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal post-lumpectomy RFA. The proposed device is designed to mechanically fit the post-lumpectomy cavity for near-perfect tissue contact. The control unit includes advanced algorithms that utilize machine learning to create a three-dimensional ablation status map of each margin (ablation vs in-ablated) for controlling ablation. The combined system allows the surgeon to customize and monitor the three-dimensional ablation profile and automates therapy delivery to ensure accurate, precise ablation results. The objectives propose gathering device requirements, identifying critical tasks of an automated RFA procedure, and improving the system algorithm by collecting training data in cadaveric and prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The intellectual merits proposed are: (1) an automated ablation system implemented on an embedded microprocessor and co?]processor FPGA capable of ablation shape estimation and control; (2) a system that demonstrates clinical relevance through successful ablation in human tissue and surgeon usability."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes."

This improvement will accelerate deployment of intelligent systems and improve scalability through localized intelligence. Our technology automates hardware design, implementation, and deployment to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems.

The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients.

Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care."

As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers."

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The primary goal of the ISU Site is to embed a strong and pervasive culture of entrepreneurship and innovation across the entire campus community. With a rigorous and experiential program of study, led by experts, this Site interfaces with other innovation Sites in the Midwest and, within five years, is expected to propel the university towards reaching its full potential in terms of creating new ventures. This goal is being accomplished via a new entrepreneurial ecosystem that effectively integrates several key components including a continuum of entrepreneurship options, mentors, funding networks and assistance, Angel investors, a "Startup Factory" program and space in a new Startup Factory Building. 

Expectations are that the ISU Site is energizing solutions to grand challenges - such as food production to serve a growing global population - that require innovative thinking and creativity in agriculture, engineering and other disciplines. ISU, a land grant institution steeped in traditions of agriculture, contributes a record of entrepreneurial contributions reflecting its strengths in engineering, bio-renewables, materials science and agriculture. In the long term, the I-Corps site will generate a new body of academics, holistically trained as scientists-technologists-entrepreneurs, equipped with knowledge and skills to galvanize transformative new solutions to vexing agricultural and other global problems that will ensure the robustness and sustainability of the food and energy supply chain. Association with other agricultural and engineering schools in the Midwest enhances the knowledge base and creates a virtual network of innovators and entrepreneurs driving the economy of the entire Midwest region. 

Through partnership with the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA), the Iowa Innovation Council and the Iowa Innovation Corporation (I-ICorp), novice entrepreneurs from the ISU innovation ecosystem connect with the broader network of venture capitalists and business leaders in the state; through practical experiential learning modules, cohorts collaborate with a diversity of successful real-world entrepreneurial businesses (bioscience, information technology, bioenergy etc.) in the Research Park as well as the more mature companies (Pioneer-DuPont, Monsanto and John Deere) that drive the economic engine of the state; and, the Site training program incorporates respect for and inclusiveness of all forms of diversity in the innovation economy."

This novel technology for the treatment of landfill gas/biogas to remove siloxanes uses the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles as the adsorption media. The innovation of this technology will make electricity generation from landfill gas more sustainable and more attractive economically.  In addition, the development of a new reuse market for waste tires will reduce the burden of tire disposal across the U.S.  By providing an economical solution for siloxane control as well as creating a reuse option for waste tires, the well-being of communities near landfills will potentially be improved.

This I-Corps project will help to propel electricity generation from landfill gas by removing one of the major obstacles to its use.  A major challenge to the use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source comes from trace contaminants, namely 'silica containing compounds' called siloxanes which are converted to silicon dioxide, a glass like substance that reduces engine efficiency, reduces heat transfer, increases scour and abrasion, and accelerates equipment deterioration.  This innovation is the development of a new siloxane adsorption process using waste tire rubber particles.  Using this approach, the siloxane nuisance in landfill gas to electricity plants will be mitigated. Currently, there are limited options for the reuse of the rubber material from waste tires.  The development of an effective adsorption process using the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles represents an exciting entrepreneurial opportunity to turn this waste product into a marketable adsorbent that can compete with activated carbon adsorption for siloxane control.

Since the proposed PCMs will be produced with organic, bio-based polymers, new business and market opportunities are anticipated to be created, especially in the states with a strong agricultural basis. This will not only offer a viable alternative to the current petroleum-based, paraffinic PCMs, but will also have a meaningful contribution to improving the social and economic well-being of communities in both urban and rural areas.

This I-Corps project will investigate the market potential of concrete materials transformed with (1) agricultural-based PCMs tailored to deliver a high capacity for energy storage and (2) porous lightweight aggregates selected to act as a container for PCMs. One of the distinct features of the proposed PCMs is an adjustable melting temperature, which helps target a range of comfort temperatures and climate zones. Further to performance considerations, the encapsulation method to incorporate PCMs into building envelope components will be one of the main focuses of this project. A number of macro- and micro-encapsulation methods have been developed to date for the use of PCMs in the building sector. Although the micro-encapsulation methods are proven to deliver an acceptable long-term performance, the estimated cost of them is in the range of 45%-65% of the total cost of the system. Exploiting the porous structure of lightweight aggregates commonly used in concrete is expected to eliminate the need to resort to costly encapsulation methods, while contributing to the rapidity and flexibility of construction, depending on customer-specific needs and preferences.

"abstractText": "This project will develop a cyberinfrastructure framework to facilitate research on the efficient management of agricultural practices and their impact on water resources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB).  Large-scale data acquisition, integration, analysis, and visualization using data-enabled information technologies will accelerate the dissemination of knowledge, experience, and shared resources (e.g., technology, equipment, and people) among communities and partners.  The key element of the project is a new cyber platform, the Upper Mississippi Information System (UMIS), which will provide water quality data within a rich spatio-temporal hydrologic context.  The UMIS directly addresses three of the Grand Challenges for Engineering identified by the National Academy of Engineering: i) provide access to clean drinking water; ii) manage the nitrogen cycle; and iii) engineer the tools of scientific discovery.  The UMIS will immediately begin facilitating data access, integration, and scientific discovery for water quality challenges in the UMRB. 

UMIS will offer internet-based open access to water quality information in its meteorological, hydrological, and geographical context, providing almost endless potential benefits for stakeholders.  For example, the experimental design of the UMIS will enable researchers to study spatial scaling, efficiency of various land use and agricultural practices to improve water quality, and the impact of climate change on land management and water quality.  Decision-makers, producers, and extension staff will be able to assess the relative efficacy of local (e.g., best management practices) versus system-level (e.g., state programs) solutions designed to reduce pollution, optimize the use of resources, and evaluate tradeoffs among competing objectives.  For all stakeholders, the UMIS will support partnerships and collaborations, increase dissemination of information about a critical natural resource to empower stakeholders at all levels, and set new standards in the communication of scientific data.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to improve manufacturing technology for the purification of monoclonal antibodies, which are important therapeutics as well as valuable tools in research and diagnostics. Approximately four new antibody drugs are approved every year, and while they can have tremendous clinical outcomes and are sometimes heralded as "magic bullets," they often come with a significant price tag. This puts a strain on patients and insurance companies, limiting the accessibility of antibody-based drugs. Furthermore, antibodies are critical research tools that enhance the understanding of biology. The technology developed in this research project will provide a completely novel method for the purification of antibodies from cell culture that will lower cost, increase manufacturing throughput, and accelerate the time to market for new therapeutics. Commercially, this technology will disrupt the current gold standard - Protein A resin - making antibody purification simpler, faster, and cheaper at all scales: research, clinical, and industrial. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop technology for improved purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Although upstream production of antibodies in cell culture has improved dramatically, downstream purification has not kept pace, resulting in a production bottleneck and a major market opportunity. The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to demonstrate technical and commercial feasibility of a new technology that combines affinity with liquid-liquid phase separation to separate antibodies from cell culture contaminants. It involves an antibody-binding domain fused to a biopolymer with stimulus responsive phase behavior. When this fusion protein is added to cell culture harvest, it binds the antibody and, after triggering the phase separation with salt, pulls the antibody out of solution. The purified antibody can then be eluted from the fusion by lowering the pH. This project aims to 1) optimize regeneration conditions so that the fusion can be reused, 2) evaluate long-term stability, and 3) validate the technology at scale and conduct a head-to-head comparison to the industry gold standard, Protein A resin. The goal is to identify storage conditions that provide a long shelf life for a product that can be reused 10-100 times without compromising antibody yield or purity. The focus of the project is to demonstrate promising capabilities of the technology for use in industrially manufactured monoclonal antibodies, replacing conventional chromatography steps with a simpler and more cost-effective method.

form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
can prompt innovation across many industries.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing.


This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need."

"abstractText": "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive, personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms. The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations, generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year over year. 


The innovation in this project is the creation of methods and algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content, appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher "dashboard" to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development, the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on both Android and iOS markets."

"abstractText": "This project, from Jackson State University Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, establishes an I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Jackson State University Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (JSU Center) strengthens their culture of entrepreneurship by supporting the translation of research from lab to market through training for faculty, students, and staff in the areas of academic entrepreneurship and innovation. The JSU Site:
-Offers entrepreneurial training and development opportunities for faculty and student teams in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to prepare them for participation in the NSF I-Corps Teams Program or for further commercialization; 
-Broadens the participation of underrepresented, specifically African American, faculty and students in STEM and entrepreneurial training and development; and 
-Builds the capacity of faculty and students to explore the translation of academic research into tools, products, services, etc. that are favorable candidates for commercialization. 
These objectives are carried out through three major activities: 
-Twelve weeks of training for 30 STEM teams per year that emphasizes the role of customer discovery and the business model canvas in the journey toward commercialization.
-A year-long series of academic entrepreneurship workshops offered to the teams as well as to the campus community
-An end of the year Academic Entrepreneurship Networking and Engagement Session, hosted annually in conjunction with Mississippi Innovation Month and Global Entrepreneurship Week.

While progress has been made in understanding how to support scholars in the transition of research and innovations from lab to market, little attention has been directed to the ways in which faculty and students at minority serving institutions may require different levels of support or engagement to be successful in their entrepreneurial efforts. Teaching-loads, service requirements, and limited resources may hinder faculty of color at minority serving institutions from venturing into entrepreneurship. Lack of exposure to STEM professionals and limited access to information regarding entrepreneurship may limit African American students? opportunities to participate in research based academic entrepreneurship. Situating an I-Corps Site within the JSU institutional contributes to greater understanding of the best practices for overcoming the obstacles that hinder people of color and women in STEM from participating in innovation and commercialization activities.

Through teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up, and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented students with STEM faculty and successful entrepreneurs also impacts the community by providing important networking, mentorship, and research opportunities - all of which are essential parts of recruiting and retaining students and promoting career advancement for faculty."

This I-Corps Site award enables JHU to leverage research outcomes by providing teams with an essential stipend for customer discovery and prototyping and the ability to validate and test their hypotheses and confirm through customer discovery whether there is value in their technology in the marketplace. By actually getting out of the lab, researchers gain insights into the mindset of decision makers and the payers who may become their customers. This grant will enable the JHU Site to provide a better learning experience for its participants by providing additional, non-dilutive funds.

For example, in the fall of 2015, JHU's Short Course cohort focused on life sciences and brought together teams from universities across the city. The focused approach allowed instructors to delve into the unique challenges faced by researchers commercializing technology in the life sciences space including the development of strategic partnerships and the need for greater evidence based research at a time when the life science industry is investing less in research and development and easing away from the risks of basic and translational research.

The I-Corps Site at JHU fills the fundamental educational disconnect between invention and market that is not found inside a lab or classroom but only through customer interviews. The goal of the JHU I-Corps Site will be to advance the knowledge and understanding of the commercial potential of life and basic science research while providing access to the life science expertise of Johns Hopkins to include translation, partnering, and entrepreneurship for the greater National
Innovation Network.

Participants in the JHU Site include teams from other universities especially those with diverse populations such as University of Maryland Baltimore City, Morgan State University, and Coppin State University, fostering collaboration and economic growth in the city and beyond. Over five years, this grant will impact 150 JHU teams and to a minimum 45 non-JHU teams, each comprised of three team members, for a total of at least 585 participants."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to ablate brain tumors and other cranial soft tissues with less infection, better outcomes, and reduced cost compared to current alternatives. Currently, there are around 700,000 individuals diagnosed with brain tumor in the US, with another 80,000 expected to be diagnosed this year (National Brain Tumor Society, 2017). Nearly two thirds, or 54,000, of these patients will undergo surgery as a first course of treatment at one of 5,000 neurosurgical centers in the US. The majority of patients are currently treated with invasive cranial flap resection procedures. Furthermore, the proposed technology may offer a therapeutic option for the 13,000 patients with high-risk primary malignant tumors that may be considered inoperable with current surgical approaches. The thermal ablation medical device market represents a $2.2B opportunity in the US, with ultrasound thermal ablation technology valued at $334M with an annual market growth rate of 13.5% (BCC Research, 2017). This innovation would offer a unique tool for neurosurgeons apart from cranial surgical navigation tools with a $459M US market, which are currently considered the standard of care for cranial surgery.

This I-Corps project will explore a minimally invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device to ablate brain tumors and other cranial soft tissues, which features a hybrid transducer tip to apply therapeutic ultrasound to the targeted anatomy while simultaneously using ultrasound imaging to visualize the surgery site. Our simulation modeling determined the appropriate parameters for an initial prototype to precisely focus ultrasound and create a lesion using a flexible transducer phased array in a heterogeneous medium volume simulating cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue (Zhang et al., 2017, AAPM Annual Meeting). These data showed that our system could provide the same efficacy of treatment with two orders of magnitude less power than non-invasive, transcranial HIFU devices. The project team then built a prototype based on the simulation results, and showed proof-of-concept functionality using a bovine serum albumin protein phantom. One of the primary challenges of this project will be to maintain the acoustic performance of the probe as the project moves toward miniaturization of the technology to fit the probe within the brain ventricles. The team will pursue further customer discovery to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical workflow, revenue streams, reimbursement, and regulatory aspects, with the goal to build an evidence-based business plan.

"abstractText": "The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales--from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place--reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection--yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals, could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is "presence", telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercially develop an in vitro (cell culture) platform to enhance the efficiency of drug discovery. Every drug delivered to a human engages the network of blood vessels for delivery to the target tissue or as part of the removal. An essential feature of the blood vessel network is an extensive network of small vessels surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract and dilate to control blood flow, and thus drug delivery. There are no in vitro human platforms that can mimic this biological function, despite the fact that cardiovascular toxicity is the leading cause of failure in clinical trials. As such, a pre-clinical tool to assess vascular toxicity would significantly impact the drug development process. Developing a successful drug averages 10-12 years and nearly $2.6 billion. Despite the fact that ~60% of the total development costs are spent on human clinical trials, fewer than 1 in 10 entering clinical trials will succeed. There is a significant opportunity to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug screening which, in turn, will generate dramatic cost savings and shorten time-to-market. The company's proposed vasoactive human vascular network represents a leap forward in technology to simulate the human response to new and existing drugs. Furthermore, the platform technology has broad future applications including the incorporation of tissue specific function (e.g, human tumor cells) and patient specificity which will further advance drug development and precision medicine.

There are currently no in vitro platforms that can mimic vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation, processes which require vasoresponsive smooth muscle cells. Competing technologies line prefabricated tubes or membranes with endothelial cells to mimic the vasculature which will never be able to simulate vasoactivity. Since the company's platform is comprised of living dynamic microvessels, the company is uniquely positioned to create a platform with this functionality. The primary objective is to develop a 3D perfused human vascular network with smooth muscle providing the capacity to characterize vasoactive substances. The company will achieve the primary objective by completing two specific aims: 1) Incorporate human smooth muscle cells into a 3D in vitro vascular network; and 2) Quantify the dose-response of the 3D perfused vessel network to a panel of vasoactive drugs. Achieving vasoactive functionality in an in vitro vascular network will be the first demonstration of this critical biological phenomenon, and will meet an important commercial need in the pharmaceutical industry.

The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process.  This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption.  Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide.

This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters.  Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.

This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.

To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.  The proposed research and simulation testing will validate the patented system and create a proposed program for customer field testing prior to commercialization (Phase II).

The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.



The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way."

Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions. However, there still is no technology or research available to monitor and predict the shrinkage on-line during production to improve, to optimize and to control parts quality and processing parameters without using expensive instrumentation. The outcome of this Phase I project will fill this gap and develop a fully functional multivariate shrinkage sensor which will enable measurement of molded product dimensions in situ prior to ejection from the mold.

This project proposes an innovative Fourth Sector Ecosystem incubator that brings a coordinated suite of services to local communities to engage them, educate them, and provide financial capital through a crowdfunding platform. This project will engage four communities in a pilot study designed to engage and educate key leaders, energize advocacy for fourth-sector growth, and catalyze fourth-sector social enterprises by offering capital access through crowdfunding. The validation of this grass-roots scalable educational and participatory incubator will enable communities to support local for-benefit businesses who will improve the quality of life in their communities, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, leading to expansion of this model across the nation and globally.


The innovation inherent in this educational platform is the synergy between the components of its scalable, turnkey process to provide a catalyst for fourth-sector business growth. Innovative components include a robust, secure crowdfunding platform, educational training for community leaders and businesses in fourth-sector principles, assessment methods to evaluate/provide continuous improvement of the process, gamification that rewards fourth-sector-supporting behaviors; and network-building processes. The goals of this research are to determine the performance, design and educational training specifications that will address the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., entrepreneurs, community leaders, contributors), and demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through a pilot study in four communities. Methods will focus on continuous evaluation and feedback from stakeholders in the four communities to determine best methods to teach communities to manage their incubators, activate their communities to participate, achieve campaign success, demonstrate improved learning outcomes from the training, and increase the density and reciprocity of networks in the pilot communities. Surveys and data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each component in the process, from planning to implementation to assessment, as shown through survey results, expansion of networks, and funding raised by fourth sector enterprises using the crowdfunding tool.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is mainly in the area of machine condition monitoring. Vibration monitoring is an integral part of any machine condition monitoring regimen. All equipment that comprise belts, gears, bearings, drive motors, or other moving components have a specific vibration signature during normal operating cycles. Change in equipment vibration serves as an early warning of a decline in operating condition and signals the need for preventative maintenance to avoid more serious equipment faults and failure.  Due to extremely small form-factor and wireless signal detection scheme of the sensing tag in the proposed vibration monitoring system of this project, simple and cost-effective direct measurement of vibration from hard-to-access parts of machinery (e.g. rotor in an electric motor) is enabled. This will have a significant impact on widespread use of such vibration monitoring techniques, hence improving the performance and safety of the equipment, extend their lifetime and avoid any unplanned downtime or maintenance across a host of existing and new industries and applications. 

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will initially focus on developing wireless battery-less accelerometers that can achieve very high resolution. The operating principle of the resonant accelerometer to be developed has never been demonstrated in the past and it is through this novel concept that high-sensitivity wireless measurement of acceleration is made possible. The proposed sensor consists of a piezoelectric resonant cavity coupled to an antenna that utilizes the piezoelectric stiffening effect to produce an acceleration-dependent resonance frequency. The center frequency of the resonator is wirelessly interrogated through pulsed excitation signals. One main and particularly attractive feature of the sensors is the simplicity of the sensor tag where no electronics are required. An acceleration detectivity of less than 50mg for a device operating in the 27.12MHz ISM band is targeted in this project which meets the requirement for a wide variety of application including motor vibration monitoring.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective high-performance platform to monitor and characterize phytoplankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be toxic or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns (such as recent "red tide" events in Florida, USA) and drastic economic consequences (i.e. deadly effects of harmful algal blooms on the aquaculture industry). The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collection and evaluation using a benchtop microscope or optical digital imaging system. In contrast, the proposed platform will be transformative by enabling low-cost, portable and fast monitoring and automated characterization of aquatic microorganisms. Therefore, this platform will revolutionize monitoring of aquatic microorganisms and, being low cost, it will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets. Some of these future applications include more efficient biofuels research and development (via algae monitoring), marine biology science and education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, production algae monitoring. Therefore, the potential societal impact and commercial potential of the proposed technology is transformative.

The proposed project aims to develop and evaluate a portable, rapid, durable and environmentally-stable imaging flow-cytometry technology that will automatically monitor microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and pathogens present in the flowing water, and will be capable of specific classification. Existing optics-based flow-cytometry solutions are expensive and not durable for field use. Unlike lab-based flow cytometers or hand-held assays, the proposed system will not rely on reagents or labeling, and therefore will not need an expert/professional, and will keep the evaluated water unchanged. Thus, it can be installed for continual unattended operation and will be much more cost-effective per test due to elimination of an expert's time, costly reagents and fluorophores. Furthermore, the proposed system will also be integrated with a machine learning engine capable of automated identification of microorganisms as well as other micro-objects of interest. Finally, the proposed system will be evaluated on pre-collected samples of local coastal ocean water to determine the presence of three example types of phytoplankton microorganisms and to provide statistical distribution of all of the detected micro-objects. Therefore, the proposed system will be transformative and provide an innovative and unique capability to expediently survey samples of water and automatically characterize identified micro objects.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop and commercialize a high resolution, protein-based retinal implant intended to restore vision to the millions of patients blinded by retinal degenerative diseases, particularly retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. These currently incurable and blinding diseases affect between 30-50 million people worldwide, and lead to a loss of independence for the individual, as well as an increased burden on their caregivers. While improved quality of life is the most vital outcome of this technology, reduction of medical costs of treating chronic retinal degeneration and limiting time with doctors will also be of benefit to the broad healthcare field.  The work outlined in this SBIR proposal also has the potential to significantly impact our understanding of retinal degenerative diseases, which will help in developing better and more effective treatments for a number of ophthalmic indications. The subretinal implant under development provides the framework for the next generation of high-resolution retinal prosthetics, while offering a cost-effective solution to vision restoration, and will help these patients regain independence and thus improve their quality of life. 

The proposed project will expand on the data collected from the in vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.  These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology under development."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project supports development of an innovative device for use in laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery of the abdomen). Laparoscopic injuries most often occur during primary port entry, before visualization into the abdominal cavity is possible. Injuries are primarily to the bowel or vasculature and are very serious, with mortality rates up to 5% for bowel injuries and up to 15% for vascular injuries. To minimize this risk, surgeons lift the abdominal wall away from the vital organs that could be inadvertently punctured during primary port entry. Two lifting techniques are commonly utilized, but one is unreliable and the other invasive. The product in development utilizes suction instead of mechanical force to grasp the abdominal wall and is more reliable and less invasive than the current techniques. Projected benefits include better surgical outcomes, increased surgeon and patient satisfaction, and decreased patient post-op pain. Successful development of this product is forecasted to create 40 new jobs by 2023 with an annual payroll exceeding $2.5M. As a direct result of this Phase I grant, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2019 and become the gold standard for abdominal wall lifting devices in the next five years.

The technical innovation in this proposed project is a novel abdominal lifting device for use in laparoscopic surgery that is more reliable and less invasive than current lifting techniques. The novelty of the innovation is affirmed with one issued patent and an additional pending patent application. The device takes advantage of existing suction available in every operating room.  This suction allows for the non-invasive attachment of the lifting device to the abdominal wall.  Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using perforating towel clips. Manual grasp does not always provide a secure grip and perforating towel clips invasively perforate abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The technical goals of this project focus on creating a minimum viable product produced with biocompatible materials using standard good manufacturing practices for FDA Class I medical devices. Production quality samples will be produced with five different materials to determine which performs best in terms of strength, reliability, and flexibility. These samples will also be used to determine if any further design changes are needed prior to commercialization.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry. Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology has the potential to reduce the solar industry's 2026 carbon footprint by over 50%. 

The proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines. As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then investigates and optimizes our wafers' performance during each critical step of commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing. A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can 'drop-in' to an existing cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this process.

This provides an opportunity to reduce estimated $78.5 Billion - $127.3 Billion in waste due to reactive maintenance per year in the US commercial facilities market alone.  A data driven, proactive approach provides a unique opportunity that enable facilities managers to assess as-is conditions of assets, avoid non value-add activities and plan maintenance tasks to avoid failures and shutdown. This will contribute towards transforming a traditional industry to an advanced data-driven one.  It will also enable significant reduction in the disruptions caused to occupants due to failures in facilities.  Given that Americans spend 85-90% of their time indoors and any disruptions caused by facilities directly impact their qualities of lives, the broader societal impact of reducing failures in facilities is significant.  

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends to research, develop and demonstrate the feasibility of using big data analytics and machine learning to transform facilities operations and maintenance decisions. Owners and operators of the over five million commercial and institutional buildings in the United States are faced with the challenges of managing aging and crowded building infrastructure. They waste between 30% and 40% of resources by operating in a predominantly inefficient, reactive mode. This project targets development of computational mechanisms that automatically analyze integrated building information to identify patterns that lead to actionable insights that help reduce non value-add activities and improve resource utilization in FM daily operation and planning. By combining advanced machine learning technologies with existing building information modeling (BIM) resources, the company is proposing to develop high-impact, statistical and visual methods for optimizing the decision-making abilities of facility managers and with that, the performance of critical facilities infrastructure and maintenance crews.  The results of this research will include algorithms and methods to normalize heterogeneous building data, detect patterns and anomalies, from which actionable insights can be derived with domain knowledge, and generate qualitative and quantitative output appropriate for improved decision making in managing commercial facilities."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the problem of assessing blood clotting and associated bleeding and thrombosis risks in neonatal and pediatric patients. Existing coagulation analyzers put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. This project will develop Acoustic Tweezing Thomboelastometry (ATT) for these patients.  Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $2.0 billion annually.

This SBIR Phase I project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood (<6uL in volume).  The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly minimal marketable product for the market of pediatric coagulation analyzers. This goal will be achieved by meeting the following three objectives: 1) build the user-friendly prototype; 2) develop integrated software for device control, data acquisition, and data analysis; and 3) calibrate the prototype and standardize it for coagulation measurements.

These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually, a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a considerable commercial impact.  
 
The proposed project will develop a non-invasive electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.  The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing, with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial, micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error, and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples of a variety of material types. 

The objective of this Phase II project is to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield, represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general, including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping."

"abstractText": "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will scale-up development of eco-friendly, cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish with high corrosion resistance and robust solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Conventional ENIG currently available in the market is prone to black-pad defects (hyper-corrosion related failures) associated with de-wetting of solder. ENIG also suffers from brittle solder joint failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies - component disconnection which lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Moreover, most ENIG manufacturers/suppliers provide cyanide-based gold chemistry which has health and ecological hazards. The novel ENIG eliminates black pads- corrosion related issues, achieves robust solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly. Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for immersion gold process making it eco-friendly. This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year). 

The primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies. The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development, optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market. This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.) as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios and various industry standard based testing including drop and vibration tests and solder ball shear and pull tests at extended thermal exposures."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the potential to deploy a powerful tool for carbon capture.  CO2-capture is the foundation of greenhouse gas mitigation.  The high cost of current processes for CO2-capture have prevented their widespread deployment.  High-pressure, Density-driven Separator (HDS) technology efficiently and continuously captures CO2 from gas streams, including both flue gas and fuel gas.  An HDS module produces nearly Pure High-pressure CO2 (PH-CO2).  HDS technology has transformational operating expense enabled by innovative strategies for compression, expansion, energy recovery, and subsequent use of the dense and light fractions.  An HDS module has no moving parts, membranes, pressure swings or temperature swings.  Therefore, HDS technology has the potential for very low capital expense.  These low costs allow access to financial markets.  Other revenue sources are also facilitated by low capture cost.  For instance, PH-CO2 is food grade, valued in excess of $100/ton.  PH-CO2 is suitable for enhanced oil recovery.  HDS technology separates CO2 from fuel gas, producing a valuable high-pressure vapor, in addition to PH-CO2.  HDS technology dramatically reduces the CO2-capture cost and provides a purity that enables a profitable B2B model. 

This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop HDS technology.  Quantitative metrics will be refined and employed to develop detailed capital expense and operating cost models.  Two technical hurdles must be overcome to reduce these costs.  These hurdles are also opportunities for innovation.  The first opportunity is to achieve sufficient volumetric efficiency in the pressure vessel for commercial deployment.  The equilibrium state inside the HDS module is perfect separation.  Increasing the rate of approach to that equilibrium state reduces the size and cost of the HDS module. This will be accomplished by exploiting the synergy between fluid state, surface state, fluid motion, and gravity.  This synergy coalesces CO2, allowing its rapid separation from the remaining components of flue gas and fuel gas.  The second opportunity is to achieve sufficient overall process efficiency for commercial deployment.  The power required for compression determines operating expense.  Our strategy involves operating the near-isothermal cold compression train and near-isothermal hot expansion train as a heat engine (an approximation of the Ericsson cycle).  In this manner, innovative gerotor compressors and expanders work together with heat exchangers using waste heat to reduce or eliminate operating costs.

Unfortunately, we all suffer the consequences, as litter impacts our economy, degrades the environment, demoralizes community pride, kills wildlife, and poisons the food system. This project builds on the accomplishments of an SBIR Phase I project that developed a mobile technology empowering anyone to identify, map, and collect the world's litter, while simultaneously connecting to a broader community of associated brands, cities, schools. 


The company has integrated image recognition and machine learning algorithms into its software to advance the crowdsourcing of litter data and cleanup activities. This advancement will allow for the identification of litter even if the item is in a deep state of decay and decomposition. This project also aims to continue building the Global Database of Litter, a technology platform that integrates the company's litter taxonomic classification with other data sets including location, time, retail locations, and the watershed. This data provides great potential to improve municipal infrastructure, resource allocation, brand packaging redesign, and individual responsibility that promotes positive behavioral change. Like the National Science Foundation, this project aims to promote the progress of science and advance our national health, prosperity, and welfare.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe, renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations, such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies."

"abstractText": "This project, from Louisiana State University (LSU), creates an Innovation Corps Site (I-Corps Site)

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Louisiana State University's (LSU) I-Corps Site nurtures and supports multiple, local teams of faculty, students, and the LSU community that are transitioning their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace. 

The LSU Emerging Technology Preparation (LA EMTEC Prep) program provides training, education, and mentorship to LSU faculty, students, and the community through a six to eight week training program focused on Intellectual Property, the Business Model Canvas, Basics of Licensing and Technology Transfer, Small Business Innovation Research Grants, I-Corps Teams, and other funding mechanisms, Customer Discover and Hypothesis Validation, and Early Stage funding for Research Intensive Companies. Projects can originate from student work, funded or unfunded research at LSU, institutional, or industrial projects. The LA EMTEC Prep program makes LSU technology more competitive in funding programs, as well as increasing the number of new start-up businesses, licensing agreements, and third-party investor reviews stemming from LSU based innovations. 

The LA EMTEC Prep program improves commercialization outcomes for LSU technologies by encouraging researchers (including Post-Doctoral scholar, graduate student, undergraduate, or professional staff) to tackle marketability questions early in their research process and pivot their research accordingly, by training LSU researchers and students on commercialization principles, and by better preparing all parties at LSU to succeed in I-Corps Teams and other intensive assessment programs. Over time, LSU's participation in I-Corps Sites will (1) stimulate the translation of fundamental university-based research into commercially viable technologies, (2) encourage faculty, students, and community-based industry personnel to collaborate around early stage university technologies, and (3) enhance the understanding of faculty, students, and community-based industry partners through hands-on training and experiential learning in innovation and entrepreneurship."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this i-Corps project is safer and more reliable 3D printed metal structures, also commercially known as additive manufactured parts.  The project will explore the needs of the 3D printing industry as the technology is applied to ever more demanding areas such as aerospace and automotive.  In aerospace, each component must be produced by a verified and validated procedure, and in-situ inspection can meet that need.  In the automotive industry, representative components must be evaluated to verify production procedures and equipment operation; again, in-situ inspection can meet this need.   In addition to aerospace and automotive, 3D printed metal structures are expected to have wide commercial applications, ranging from health to defense.  In these applications, safety and reliability are paramount.  For example, a 3D printed replacement for a broken bone must be highly resistant to breakage itself.  However, the mass limitations for a bone replacement require efficiency in design and a trust in fabrication.  

This I-Corps project is a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method that is used to observe the metal structure while it is being printed or upon completion of the manufacturing process.  Historically, metal parts must be subjected to destructive inspection methods to meet high reliability requirements after manufacturing.  This alternative NDE is based on a novel X-ray imaging method, grating-based interferometry, first introduced about ten years ago.  In this method, micro-fabricated X-ray optics are used to enhance the X-ray image, especially for the detection of sub-micron features.  The traditional X-ray image is improved with an overlay image that reveals the presence of sub-micron features.  Recently, sub-micron features in 3D printed metal components have been correlated with preliminary crack formation under fatigue stress.  Therefore, an X-ray grating-based interferometry image of a freshly printed structure (either in-progress or completed) can reveal the presence of failure points.  By demonstrating the viability of this unique NDE methodology to potential users of 3D printed parts, it is anticipated that new market segments can gain sufficient confidence in part reliability to incorporate these 3D printed parts into critical components.

Over the lifetime of this 3-year project, 15 students will participate. Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited. The unifying research theme of IRiKA is smart systems with the subtopics of sensors, emerging electronics, and materials and process development. In addition to lab work and weekly cohort research meetings, IRiKA students will visit Korea's government research institutions and global leaders in the tech industry such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. The distinctive features of IRiKA are: 1) A cohort experience bringing the US participants together; 2) Vetted and structured professional development program tailored for both US students and Korean mentors; and 3) Availability of follow-on collaborative projects in US and Korea to facilitate a sustained global network of mentorship. Students will gain formative research skills and learn how smart systems brings together interdisciplinary technological solutions for manufacturing, healthcare, energy, safety and security, transportation, and logistics. The international aspect of the IRiKA will help students recognize their place in the global scientific community. The participants will present their work at their home institutions upon their return and will be incentivized to publish in a peer-reviewed journal or present at a conference for broader dissemination. 

Interdisciplinary Research in Korea on Applied smart systems (IRiKA) for Undergraduate Students will engage students in interdisciplinary research, help them develop a global perspective on collaboration, and motivate them to pursue a career in STEM research. Efforts will be made to attract students underrepresented in STEM and/or with limited STEM research opportunities. IRiKA takes a scaffolded mentorship approach that fosters students' growth from a relatively dependent status to as independent a status as their competence warrants. Smart systems incorporate sensing, actuation, wireless connectivity, and machine learning. Examples of research projects that individual students will conduct during 8 weeks in Korea include: Development of an air-borne particle sensing system for health monitoring and air quality monitoring; Development of miniature and micro power generation systems to enable autonomous sensor systems; and Development of a light-weight, flexible point-of-care device consisting of microfluidic channels and reduced graphene oxide-based biosensors. Upon return to the US, students will be able to engage in follow-on projects in areas such as convergent IoT systems at University of Florida's NSF I/UCRC Multi-functional Integrated Systems Technology (MIST) center and wearable sensor systems at Louisiana State University.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop."

These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today's electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar 'internet of things' devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this 'wafer 2.0' will help to shape America's high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world's largest nanotechnology focused institute.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process."

Leading sunscreens that are currently on the market have been shown to be inadequate in protection against UVA damage (photoaging). Moreover, Oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are found in over 80% of chemical sunscreens, have been shown to be highly toxic to coral cells. Estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen settle into the world?s coral reefs every year and the oxybenzone that is present in many of these sunscreens cause coral bleaching and accelerate the destruction of the world?s already fragile coral reefs. The Magic Blue sunscreen uses an alternative eco-friendly technology to protect the skin from UVA and UVB damage, and the successful commercialization/market adoption of the Magic Blue sunscreen will significantly benefit the global environment by protecting our aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs, from further oxybenzone/octinoxate-induced damage. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR/STTR) Phase I project will develop a novel coral reef-friendly sunscreen that can provide broad spectrum protection. Magic Blue, LLC is partnering with the University of Maryland, College Park and collaborating with the Carnegie Institution for Science to conduct the key feasibility experiments, including biological analysis of UVA protection in 2D and 3D human skin tissues, chemical assays on SPF determination, and environmental study on the effects of the new sunscreen on soft and hard coral reefs.  Once these experiments are complete, Phase II of the project will revolve around obtaining necessary FDA approval for commercial launch. The overall outcome from a successful STTR project will be the commercialization of the world?s first sunscreen that will encompass the following attributes: scientifically proven to protect against UVA-induced photoaging, abilities to provide sufficient UVB protection and to reverse UVB-induced damage, and safe to coral reefs.

Over $160 billion is spent on sewer fees in the U.S., with year-to-year costs increasing by over 5% for many users. Even with the significant resources spent on wastewater treatment, 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated sewage are still released from US wastewater treatment plants each year. Development of technologies leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to better manage complex biological and chemical processes will not only have a major impact on the $91 billion wastewater treatment system control market, but on other biochemical-dependent industries as well. In addition to reducing the societal financial burden associated with wastewater treatment, this technology will improve the sustainability of the infrastructure and will limit the environmental impact of human activities. Wastewater operators will be able to utilize this technology's real-time decision-making software to significantly reduce their municipal facility operating costs and decrease environmental pollution caused by non-compliance and overflows.


This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop real-time software for assisting wastewater treatment operators with decision-making for improved efficiency and effectiveness. Existing commercial simulation solutions for control and monitoring do not accurately reflect actual treatment plant behavior, do not model biological processes, do not require extensive configuration to be used, and do not respond rapidly to changes in plant performance. This project improves upon current approaches by linking biological components of the wastewater treatment plant with historical data using machine learning techniques. Phase I research will focus on development of: 1) an influent flow/composition model allowing accurate model inputs; 2) a full-scale hybrid model combining physical process and machine-learning bioprocess modules able to accurately predict plant effluent flow and quality, and; 3) a software platform to manage the model processes. The technical approach will focus on balancing the complexity of incorporating large-scale genomic data as part of a non-linear treatment process while ensuring high accuracy and maintaining model stability. Anticipated technical results will provide waste operators a software product that develops full-scale treatment plant models in real-time, using historical and current plant data, enabling significantly improved operational decision-making.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.


The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to put forth a solution to the critical problem of clinical trial enrollment, by improving awareness of clinical trials with physicians through technology that matches physician questions to relevant clinical trials via an online interactive social decision support platform. Patient enrollment is a significant weak link in the development pipeline and a significant pain point for organizations that sponsor clinical trials. More than two-thirds of trial sites fail to meet enrollment goals for a given trial, and up to 45% of study delays are caused by enrollment difficulties. This can result in lost revenues up to $1 million/day. Clinical trials are a critical link between scientific discovery and changes in clinical practice that advance prevention, treatments, and cures for diseases and disability. Increasing awareness of trials among physicians is key in increasing clinical trial enrollment, which in turn is essential in advancing health care practice as well as patient health and quality of life. While the area of cancer is an initial target for improved enrollment, ultimately the proposed solution can be applied to other medical specialties and be scaled globally using the same platform. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to drive clinical trial accrual by changing how physicians learn about clinical trials. The major innovation is combining a credible online social platform with powerful natural language processing technology and machine learning techniques to deliver customized clinical trial information to physicians in their decision-making process. For this Phase I project, the key objectives are: 1) To build out a prototype to match clinical trial information to relevant physician questions. Natural language processing (NLP) technology will be created to match clinical questions to related clinical trials so that physicians learn about clinical trials at the time they are seeking information on how to best treat their patients. 2) To conduct a pilot assessment of clinical trial knowledge pre- and post-use. A small subset of users of the social network platform will engage in a comparative assessment, pre- and post-exposure to the clinical trial component, to determine the technology?s impact on clinical trial knowledge.  Successful completion of Phase I will result in a user-friendly platform that matches clinical questions to oncologists and relevant, open clinical trials, and will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of the proposed concept.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the demonstration of the technical and economic feasibility of a photonic crystal enabled thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system at scales over 10 watts, which would have transformative effects in power generation for portable and remote applications. A small, high energy density TPV power source has the potential to transform multiple markets that currently rely on battery power by reducing the battery weight by 75%. For example, remote scientific instrumentation stations in polar regions rely on 1000-2000 pounds of batteries to operate through the six-month polar night, resulting in high installation costs. Dismounted warfighters carry 10-20 pounds of batteries and would have greater capability if they could carry ammunition and water instead. Small unmanned aerial vehicles would be more effective if they could fly themselves to remote and inaccessible locations, perform their mission for longer, and then return.

The proposed project will develop a new approach to photonic crystal fabrication to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy generation - the conversion of fuel into electricity with heat and light as intermediaries. A TPV generator works by burning fuel to heat a selective emitter to incandescence, leading to infrared radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. A photonic crystal selective emitter greatly improves the efficiency of the generator by almost perfectly matching its emission spectrum to the photovoltaic cell. Our photonic crystal is a square array of cylindrical micro-cavities etched into a refractory metal substrate. The research objectives of this project address the technical hurdles that limit the use of photonic crystals in TPV: scalable substrate preparation from commercial foils using a novel high-throughput process; nanofabrication over large flexible substrates using traditional semiconductor manufacturing tools; and integration with the generator by brazing. The anticipated technical results of this project are to develop a process capable of a breakthrough fifty-fold increase in photonic crystal emitter area, to enable photonic crystal fabrication on flexible substrates, and to reduce photonic crystal cost - all leading to a practical TPV generator that meets market demands.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will build technology to reduce the time needed to identify effective antibiotics for urinary tract infections (UTIs) from 2 days to 2 hours. Every year in the US, 13 million UTIs are treated with a physician's best guess antibiotic, because antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is too slow. Up to half of first guesses are wrong, opening up the possibility for infections to worsen into life-threatening sepsis and allowing antimicrobial resistance to evolve. One quarter of 1.5 million sepsis cases and at least 250,000 deaths every year begin as UTIs. Rapid AST using biophysical sensing can take guesswork out of UTI treatment, save lives, and avoid billions in unnecessary healthcare costs. By sensing bacterial cell fluctuations associated with the mechanically active processes of metabolism, motility, and growth, this novel and fundamentally different measurement concept for AST enables almost an order of magnitude increase in speed. This project will establish technical and commercial feasibility of developing the underlying sensor technology for point-of-care diagnostics that demand push-button technology operable in a hectic clinical environment. Translating innovative federally-funded technologies like this out of the laboratory and into medical clinics will build taxpayers' return on basic research investments. 

This project tackles a key technical hurdle for clinical implementation of rapid biophysical AST at a meaningful scale: demonstration that the demanding performance characteristics of the underlying resonating quartz sensor technology can be reproduced using low cost materials for a disposable resonator housing providing fluidic, thermal, and electrical control.  The rapid biophysical AST method takes the pulse of bacterial cells. Changes in mechanical fluctuations of cells occur after exposure to an effective antibiotic, and can be sensed in real time by detecting phase noise generated by cells on a resonating crystal substrate. Key to the commercial success of this technology are multichannel resonators that can be manufactured in large quantities to perform with very low noise resonance characteristics. Best practices from low cost microfluidics studies will dovetail with those from high-tech resonator development to deliver the phase noise performance needed to pick up the biological signal. Rapid prototyping tools including 3D printing will be used for quick design iterations. If satisfactory, Phase II will optimize fabrication methodologies for both resonators and housing modules interfacing with a fully integrated clinical prototype instrument ready to support clinical trials of the technology.

Quantum computers require extremely sensitive amplifiers operating near absolute zero to amplify weak signals. There are two critical features of this amplifier that will benefit the community directly: 1) the ability to have more qubits per amplifier - essential for large scale quantum computers, and 2) the ability to use a commercial manufacturing process. As quantum hardware continues to scale, so does the number of qubits, making multichannel amplifiers essential. European and Asian investment in quantum technology is growing at an alarming rate. The US is at risk of losing the leading position in this technical space. The commercialization of TWPA technology is an example of technologies required for the US to remain competitive in quantum technology.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a TWPA product prototype for the Quantum Information Processing market by addressing some of the interfacing, packaging and manufacturing limitations of experimental devices. Critical to the ability to distribute these amplifiers to the market is a means of manufacturing such devices at scale. A key advantage of the proposed technology is its ease of fabrication and the fact that it can be fabricated using an industry standard process, which will be demonstrated during the Phase I project.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an advanced manufacturing technology that will enable the production of high-quality optical glass lenses that are customizable and affordable, without the use of laborious machining or expensive tooling common in traditional lens manufacturing. The technology aims to reduce lens production costs by at least 5x while increasing throughput by ~6-8x. In addition, the project will address a key industry need to improve integration of optical components with electro-mechanical systems such as those found in compact camera modules. The methods and tools developed here will enable systems integration at a wafer level, thereby simplifying assembly, reducing cost/weight/size and improving the overall performance of many next-generation devices. This outcome will have a significant impact on imaging technology used in smartphones, wearable electronics, miniature aerial vehicles, medical endoscopes, and advanced automotive driver assistance systems. Hence, the project has the potential to benefit a diverse number of industries and strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness within the optics sector. In a broader sense, the technology developed in this project will also help revitalize American manufacturing.

The proposed project will demonstrate a new method of lens manufacturing by leveraging semiconductor processing techniques and developing an innovative lens fabrication tool. The new tool will measure key optical metrics in real-time during lens creation for on-the-fly process adjustments. Closed-loop feedback during fabrication will improve tolerances and yields and produce higher quality lenses compared to traditional methods. This approach represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing as all commercial lenses today are created through iterations of lens forming and ensuing optical metrology. Furthermore, the tool will enable rapid production of customizable lens shapes, including a novel planar lens. The flat lens will be compatible with surface modification technologies such as those used to create electronics and micro mechanical structures, thus enabling, for example, thin film transistors or sensors to be fabricated with the optics at a wafer level. Specific research activities will include (1) designing and constructing manufacturing tools and fixtures, (2) experimentally correlating tool configurations with lens shapes, (3) constructing and characterizing concave, convex and planar lenses and (4) developing a software model of the lenses based on realistic manufacturing constraints.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that enabling processing thin glass substrates for next generation communications and packaging needs will mean faster communications with improved power efficiency.  Society has an ever-expanding need for data, due to technologies such as mobile communications, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the shift of communication to higher frequencies (1s-10s of GHz).  As the frequency increases, traditional material choices, such as silicon, can experience very high losses and therefore there is increasing interest in using insulating materials, such as glass, to improve power efficiency.  Similarly, as device size is also important, ability to process thin materials is also critical.  Successful completion of this work will enable cost-effective processing of thin glass substrates and enable next generation communication initiatives impacting commercial, military and industrial markets.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposed to enable processing thin glass substrates in high volume environments.  There has been substantial interest in using glass for next generation RF and packaging solutions for many years due to its advantageous material properties, and scalability.  Of particular interest is the dielectric properties, which provide low electrical loss solutions relative to incumbent materials such as silicon.  Furthermore, the smoothness, hermetic properties and scalability of glass provides additional advantages over materials such as ceramics and organic laminates.  There has been a lot of progress in establishing processes to form thin glass and make precision through glass vias (TGV), as well as demonstrating advantaged functional performance in a lab environment.  There has been a challenge to establish the ability to scale to high volume for thin glass solutions due to gaps in the supply chain.  This SBIR project will establish a process that enables a carrier solution using a silicon carrier that will allow processing of glass in existing infrastructure making thin glass solutions available to the current well established and capable supply chain.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project involves the creation of particles that will allow one to see a map of temperature within a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurement.  This is a significant advancement because conventional thermometry is usually invasive, allows only single point temperature measurements, and may interfere with the therapeutic and imaging instrument. The proposed technology is designed to be biocompatible and minimally invasive, leading to fast 3D temperature mapping deep in the human body. The proposed materials and techniques can be used with MRI-guided thermal procedures which can replace scalpel-based surgery for a variety of cancers, improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time. The method can also be used to improve treatments for essential tremor, uterine fibrosis and arteriovenous malformation. In these treatments, the temperature in the entire affected region must be constantly monitored. Due to the limitations of the currently used temperature measurement methods, these minimally invasive MRI-guided procedures are not frequently used or take considerably longer time than desired because surgeons often must work around failed temperature measurements. The work in this proposal could transform current methods of MRI-guided thermometry, significantly reducing surgery time and cost as well as improving patient outcomes.  

This proposal develops a novel, minimally-invasive method of creating temperature maps superimposed on anatomical MRI images. The technology uses a new type of temperature-sensitive sensor, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles, and could ultimately be used within human or other tissues.  The key idea is that magnetic particles embedded in tissue will create a local dipole magnetic field that will modulate (statically or dynamically) the homogeneity of the main static magnetic field of the MRI scanner.  This changes the nuclear relaxation times of the tissue and broadens the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) linewidth, ultimately leading to local changes in the brightness of the MRI image.  The magnetization of the particles is engineered to change with temperature, and therefore the results are temperature dependent. Different shades of gray in the weighted gradient echo MR images, can then be calibrated to obtain a spatial map of temperature. This has immediate application in providing real-time temperature information to the surgeon during MRI-guided thermal interventional procedures to treat cancer, for example. These new contrast sensors can operate in a wide temperature range both below and above the human body temperature, producing spatial maps of temperature with an accuracy better than 1 degree Celsius.

This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.

The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy.

Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization."

Deposition of high-quality thin films on a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up on shower doors, can improve the scratch resistance of mobile phone displays, and can reduce the cost of energy-conserving windows. The control of energy during fabrication processes won't just broaden what films can be made; it will allow the use of a greater variety of substrates. In recent years, a number of applications have utilized traditional inorganic coatings like silicon oxide on top of new materials like organic solar cells and organic LEDs. These organic materials show greater sensitivity to degradation during the coating processes. This ion beam source can give industry, as it begins to bring these innovations to market, a tool with the level of energy control that will allow lab results to translate to high yield, low cost manufacturing. 

The proposed project addresses the challenge of depositing advanced thin films on insulating and/or delicate substrates. Control of the deposition's energy flux has been shown in laboratory demonstrations to be required for many thin films including diamond-like carbon, transparent conductive oxides on silicon and organic solar cells, and ultra-thin silver. A scalable linear ion beam sputter source will establish a high-volume manufacturing tool for thin films limited today to much smaller scale. In Phase 1, the source's functionality was demonstrated. Phase 2 has two major components: hardware development for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications. The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties. For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they will test for continuity of ultra-thin films. Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) efforts will focus on electrical properties and substrate impacts, particularly carrier lifetime in silicon.

USVs have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer by removing humans from the task. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for gathering information, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required. The development of this technology will open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection, and ultimately benefit society through: i) more information upon which to base decisions about resource management and environmental policy; ii) higher frequency of data collection activities through reduced cost; and iii) increased safety by keeping human personnel out of harsh environments.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lay the foundation for a transformative approach to environmental data collection in surface waters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing technical challenges that will enable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. This will be achieved by advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning toward intelligent obstacle characterization. The proposed framework interprets images or video of obstacles to extract salient features, such as flexibility or rigidity, through the innovative use of machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and tools borrowed from the analysis of collective behavior.

Increasing wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne illnesses creates a tremendous opportunity for natural acaricides. The project's terpene target has long been known as a highly effective and safe acaricide; however, its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production. The aim is to develop an alternative manufacturing process for biosynthetic production enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the $1.6 B acaricide market. Because the target is GRAS and because it has been used extensively as a food ingredient for decades, there is a compelling safety benefit combined with its potent efficacy, which may spur increased spraying in public areas and private residences. Overall, this project will provide a new sustainable, cost-effective production route, thereby enabling acaricide commercialization. 

This SBIR Phase II project will lead to sustainable, scalable, and economical access to a highly potent natural acaricide.  A commercial fermentation process will be developed by employing advanced metabolic engineering and protein engineering approaches for improving strain and enzyme performance.  Achieving these production metrics will enable formulation and commercialization of various acaricidal products, including yard/area sprays, which will allow better control of tick populations and halt the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.  In addition, this work will significantly advance the understanding of producing complex plant natural ingredients, thus providing economical and scalable commercial access to a wide array of compounds with significant potential benefit."

"abstractText": "Marquette University (MU) and the University of Genoa, Italy (UNIGE) will participate in an international student exchange to foster understanding of global healthcare issues and to cultivate the cultural competence required to develop biomedical engineering solutions to improve the health status of individuals around the world.  The goals of this IRES project are to increase understanding of the relationships between motor behavior and the health status of individuals at risk of requiring costly healthcare services, and to develop technological solutions that can enhance the quality of life while also reducing medical costs.  During their involvement, undergraduate and graduate students will learn important research skills, discover applied solutions for global healthcare problems, and develop international relationships.  Student projects are designed to be performed in conjunction with faculty mentors from both universities. Upon completion of those projects, new technologies can be developed for application in the healthcare industry. As such, this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project promotes the progress of science, advances the national health, and contributes to the development of a more globally competitive Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce, with efforts to attract women, first-generation, and other underrepresented minority populations. 

The research projects will focus on motor control, motor coordination and overall motor activity in individuals afflicted with Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, and/or in the elderly population.  Research projects will focus on developing technology aimed towards reducing tremor in those with Multiple Sclerosis; improving manual dexterity in those afflicted with stroke; and monitoring activities of daily living in order to assess/classify at-risk older adults. Student groups will prepare their research project under the guidance of MU faculty, they will then travel to UNIGE to collect data and begin data analysis under the mentorship of the collaborating UNIGE faculty.  While at UNIGE they will also be immersed in Italian culture and the biomedical and computer engineering field so as to increase their cultural competence.  Students will then return to MU to complete analysis and disseminate their results to scientists and the general community.

"abstractText": "This project, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) extends their NSF I-Corps Site for an additional three years.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 
I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This I-Corps Type II proposal is to continue the existing NSF I-Corps Site program at MIT. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

This Site will continue to support MIT researchers that are working on new, innovative and differentiating technologies. To date, over seventy teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps Site training programs and the total will be well over 100 by the end of the initial award. Ten teams have completed the NSF National Team Program and two more have been accepted. Collectively, the graduates have received over $8 million in additional grants or awards to continue developing their technologies. Six companies have submitted SBIR or STTR proposals and four have been awarded so far. Two companies were accepted into accelerator programs. The startups have raised over $6.5 million in early stage investment and at least twenty-five new jobs have been created. Three of the companies have successfully reached commercialization of their publicly funded new technologies. Additional outcomes show that participants learn new skills both professionally as well as in entrepreneurship. The training contributes to their current research and has affected how they will conduct their future research by including commercialization potential as part of their planning. Site participants benefit from a Team Mentoring approach through a partnership with the MIT Venture Mentoring Service that continues beyond their I-Corps training. The mentor team framework increases rates of learning and provides continuity in nurturing the teams as they advance their ideas.

MIT's activities are likely to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students, faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society; and, encouraging more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach successful outcomes, serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and growing network of universities that have launched mentoring programs based upon the VMS model."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve neural cell culture assays, thus furthering the research and development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. To enable the development of new therapies, there is a need for better functional control of long-term, physiologically relevant in vitro models that are translatable to the clinic and ultimately increase treatment efficacy and mitigate patient risk. While many components are necessary for a physiologically relevant model, one key area of concern is the substrate upon which neural cells are grown. In vitro cell culture platforms using substrates such as matrigel and recombinant human laminin can result in aggregation and delamination of cultured neurons within a week. The synthetic polymer substrate we are developing is designed to promote neural cell attachment and reduce delamination, enabling long-term culture and functional analysis of the cells. Furthermore, a defined substrate formulation is desirable for maintaining cell culture consistency that is expected to yield more homogenous neural cell populations, which is an advantage over animal-derived substrates.

This I-Corps project will focus on the commercial potential of novel synthetic polymers upon which neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can grow, expand, and differentiate into neural cell lineages. The proposed product is expected to enable enhanced neural cell attachment, while maintaining viability and functionality for long-term cell culture applications. The synthetic substrate is a poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG)-based polymer that can be mechanically modulated to alter its physical properties. Additionally, bioactive modifications that mimic the native cellular microenvironment can be incorporated to enhance functionality. A key feature of this polymer is that chemical and mechanical properties are preserved across different synthesis protocols, significantly reducing the risk of batch-to-batch variability, which is a major concern with commercially available natural substrates such as matrigel. The synthetic polymer system has previously been used to enhance the attachment of other stem cell-derived cultures such as endothelial cells and preliminary data suggest that it will support stem cell-derived NPC culture.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly solution for production improvement in oil, gas, geothermal, and groundwater reservoirs. Fracking/stimulation is a required step after drilling to increase permeability and get access to the trapped geofluid in sedimentary and rock formations. This method provides an alternative or complimentary reservoir permeability enhancement solution to current high-pressure water/acid injection-based method such as hydraulic or acid fracking. This proposed innovation will allow for an economical permeability increase without water contamination and induced seismic activities. Furthermore, this method will alleviate the demand in water stressed areas.

This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for developing a novel Electric Reservoir Stimulation (ERS) method that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping material into the subsurface. This method will consist of controlled high voltage electrical pulses applied in two electrodes placed at the depth of interest between wells. In this method, the conductivity of the geofluid along with the pulse discharge parameters (amplitude, width, frequency), and treatment time will determine the effect on the permeability of the reservoir rock. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within pores. We're performing experimental analysis in our lab on different core samples to see the effects of the proposed electric treatment. Additionally, numerical simulations are used to predict the effect of proposed method and power requirements in reservoir scale.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies primarily in its ability to stimulate growth across multiple industries. The membrane filtration technology developed allows for the separation of components of interest and value in the oil & gas, food & beverage, life sciences, textiles, and semiconductor manufacturing spaces in a more efficient manner than the methods in use today. By replacing these more expensive and energy intensive processes, the technology can provide a significant cost savings to the industrial end user, thereby generating surplus revenue, increased hiring capacity, and facilitating growth. In addition, the project will yield a societal benefit by providing a more effective and energy efficient approach for industrial process separations and wastewater treatment.

This I-Corps project further develops a robust membrane filtration technology. The membrane consists of commonly available thin-sheet silicon through which nanoscale pores are chemically etched using a simple patented process. These pores extend from one side of the silicon sheet to the other, thereby acting as channels through which water can flow. Molecules, particles, and other constituents of interest are rejected both by the physical size of the pores, and by the chemical character of the membrane surface, allowing for the removal, concentration, or separation of important components. The membrane offers a unique value proposition in that it combines a very small size cutoff offered by polymeric filters with the harsh environment compatibility of ceramic filters, while possessing excellent resistance to clogging and blockage. These properties enable low maintenance separation performance in a wide range of industrial applications where exposure to harsh environments such as high or low pH, organic solvents, and high temperatures is required.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project results from its utility for customizing interactive media experiences for diverse users in systems including workplace learning software, streaming media, educational games, and recommendation applications. This is enabled by the project's novel approach to implementing more nuanced user representations in software (online accounts, user profiles, avatars, etc.). Currently, customized systems' responses for specific user representations are expensive to produce and not expressive enough: they often are hardcoded, labor intensive to implement, and fail to support the particular needs of diverse users. In most such systems users' membership in categories (e.g., demographic groups or experts vs. novices) is determined in a top-down fashion, with no possibility for systems to respond to user representations that only partially fit in categories, inhabit multiple categories, or change over time. These deficiencies prevent systems from achieving the nuance of social category membership in everyday life. Finally, a key potential application is building interactive media supporting prosocial skill and knowledge development.

This I-Corps project will advance knowledge related to modeling user identities in commercial and socially impactful digital media systems. Key to the intellectual merit of the project, the core technology is a computational engine that models identities (using data from profiles, avatars, characters, and accounts) by mathematically computing users' degrees of membership across multiple categories over time. To computationally model category degrees of category membership, the engine computes a closeness value corresponding to the degree to which an actor deviates from a prototypical member of a category, who is defined via a set of features. The degree of membership fluctuates throughout an interactive narrative based on user behaviors. Modeling these scenarios draws upon specific concepts from sociolinguistics, cognitive science, and sociology of classification. They include: category gradience, category dynamics, multiple memberships, inter-category relationships, and prototypes. Along with numerous publications, relevant prior work has been conveyed through invited keynotes and talks at major universities, foundations, and academic venues internationally.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide on-chip optical sensors that enable faster and cheaper production of drugs and chemicals. Pharmaceutical R&D and production rely heavily on chemical analysis to provide insight into the processes at play, however analytical instruments do not follow the latest manufacturing trends towards single-use technologies and smaller batches, or even continuous production. Integrated (on-chip) photonics is an attractive sensing platform thanks to its small form factor, robustness, large multiplexing capability, and tight optical confinement that enhances light-matter interactions. This project will pioneer the large-scale use of integrated photonic sensors starting with chemical sensing, paving the way to other applications. By enabling a better understanding of the reactions at play in manufacturing processes, the proposed technology is poised to impact the pharmaceutical market and help improving public health.

This I-Corps project aims to develop the first practical implementation of a microchip-scale optical spectrometer. Integrated photonic product remain scarce due to several barriers at the fabrication and packaging levels. This project will mitigate these issues to offer equivalent sensitivity and performance to large benchtop optical spectrometers in a dramatically smaller form factor. This will be realized by combining recent advances in integrated photonic component design, photonic chip architecture, and optical packaging. The proposed sensor will enable novel chemical sensing applications and help with the understanding of processes at play in areas such as cell-based manufacturing and continuous-flow chemical manufacturing.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significantly improved in-field data collection and data analysis workflow.  This technology leverages the widespread use of smartphones around the world by providing a robust digital platform with low hardware requirements for collecting and understanding data.  By digitizing inputs from the beginning of the data collection process and providing live analysis, the platform reduces the cost, time, and expertise required to collect and understand the information contained within datasets.  The technology can benefit diverse industries, but has particular application to municipal governments and NGOs, where project managers need to regularly monitor the effect of their program.  Their ability to do so and make the necessary adjustments directly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the projects.  The technology has significant commercial potential beyond governments and NGOs, and impacts any industry that requires rapid and reliable data insights for decision making.  Over time, the technology will make data collection and usage more accessible to empower average people to better advocate for their community.

This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a fully digital in-field data platform. The technology allows any team to quickly collect and analyze in-field data.  A robust software platform forms the core of the technology. The platform automatically tags data with GPS and time information and provides live visualization of data and team activity with minimal hardware requirements. Advanced mobile algorithms manage data caching and cloud uploading. These algorithms enable the platform to operate reliably in areas with intermittent internet connection and protect data during hardware crashes. This fully digital process reduces the cost and time required to compile and interpret in-field datasets so valuable insights can be gained quickly and cheaply to facilitate data-driven decision making. Over time, this work may also increase the accessibility of data to the public and empower citizens to better advocate for their communities.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to democratize the power of machine learning and predictive analytics to help non-engineering business personnel realize the full value of their data. Enabling this will drive better organizational decision making at all levels and the creation of additional business value for commercial and governmental organizations of all kinds, and of all sizes. Data-driven decisions using big data analytics holds massive promise, but has largely remained unfulfilled primarily because, in its current form, it is unaffordable to all but the most technologically advanced organizations. Data-driven businesses have 5-6% higher productivity and can potentially add $3 Trillion in value globally, per year. A wide range of sectors, such as manufacturing, retail, finance, healthcare, security, and governmental services will see significant commercial impact including higher productivity, better utilization of resources, and the acceleration of the deployment of new products, services, and technologies. By enabling commercial and governmental entities to more effectively utilize their data and resources, businesses and government agencies will increase their productivity, more effectively utilize their personnel, improve their competitiveness, and eliminate waste resources while increasing the flow of products and services that benefit society at large. 

This I-Corps project is based on ground breaking technology meant to realize a scalable, flexible and easy-to-use data-processing infrastructure. At the highest level, building such a platform requires: (a) coming up with the right abstraction or language that accommodates all sorts of computation at scale; (b) implementing the architecture to realize such computation at scale; (c) the ability to go from "sandboxing" or "prototyping" to a production environment instantly; and (d) the ability to work in heterogenous data environments instantly. We have put forth a novel computational language, called factor graph computing. Such a computation framework is "Turing complete". Factor graph computing allows for performing data transformation, predictive modeling, and optimization at scale to enable data-driven decisions. Such a platform eliminates the need for data engineering, provides flexibility to build predictive models instantly, allows for seamless evolution by bringing in new datasets in the mix, and requires minimal support to maintain the infrastructure and allow for generating prescriptive decisions at scale.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a reduction in food losses and waste.  Roughly one third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted.  A large portion of this waste is due to proper cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers.  Transport refrigeration is an expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel.  The transport industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel engines.  This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and food processors everywhere.  The project is has the potential significantly reduce food waste worldwide.

 This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to 82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material.  This highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given volume.  These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized.  An adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel."

The initial focus will be on equipment such as compressors, valves or pumps located in a remote or dangerous location. This novel acoustic method and the corresponding AI analytics brings novel and advanced functionalities at a fraction of the cost of existing methods. This allows users such as water companies or oil producers to reduce the energy needs of their equipment while reducing downtime and enabling early detection of many types of failures.

This I-Corps project further develops an acoustic monitoring platform for remote pumping equipment.  It is a full stack internet of things solution for the monitoring, diagnostic and control of industrial equipment. Acoustic monitoring is a novel method that uses sensors to detect complex issues in remote pumping equipment. Simple surface sensors give important insight on the running condition of underground or remote equipment by integrating acoustic sensing with AI analytics. A control solution then adjusts the running condition of the equipment to extend its lifetime and increase its efficiency. The proposed industrial control solution aims to reduce down time, decrease leakage and increase the efficiency and output of many industrial pumps.

"abstractText": "This research project will develop a collaborative data science platform for computational social science called the Data Science Foundry. The collection and management of large-scale data currently is a relatively unstructured process, with data-processing decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Society has started to rely on data-driven science to address policy-related questions, however. The development of a collaborative platform that provides structure will allow social scientists to collaborate and validate each other's studies.  This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

"abstractText": "Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (e.g., requiring the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fears of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting started. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations, (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the technological refinement and concomitant commercialization of the first accurate and portable instrument that can perform in the field nondestructive test for hardness, strength and ductility of existing infrastructure. The material properties measured include yield strength, work hardening exponent and ultimate tensile strength of metals, specifically steel. The on-shore oil and gas pipeline transmission industry has pressing needs for non-destructive tests because of the aging infrastructure, national need for energy, and recent explosions and leaks that have cost lives and billions in remediation. Although transmission pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary strength data.  Therefore, there is an immediate need to verify strength during the 80,000 excavations done each year so that the life of these costly assets can be extended by identifying and remediating the few sections that are vulnerable within the extended network of 300,000 miles of pipelines. Pipe cut-outs and hydrostatic pressure tests are alternatives to nondestructive testing, but both damage the asset and require expensive and complex service interruption. 

The overall technical objective of the Phase II work is to perform the necessary research and development to enable the development of engineering specifications, system integration, and validation of the instrument to successfully perform valuable nondestructive testing to provide precise and accurate material property data. The research and development program includes three milestones, each enabling the implementation of the research into design and manufacturing of beta test units.  Milestone 1 is to enable full instrument functionality under adverse field environments such as vibration, moisture, and extreme temperatures. Milestone 2 is to perform the necessary work for designing ruggedized field units. Completion of this milestone will enhance the capability for initial field testing services.  Milestone 3 is to develop the knowledge to fully and reliably integrate the system, validate the sub-systems, and package it for manufacturing. The overall goal is to enable the company to have the necessary knowledge and experience to enter the instrument market with a leasing program for use in pipeline inspections."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets."

The development project is based on patent-pending technology for scalable and affordable manufacturing of textured coatings using existing electroplating facilities in the industry. The proposed technology will create a new generation of coatings that provide non-stick functionality where the existing nonstick coatings fall short. The existing non-stick coatings decompose at high temperatures and may produce toxic fumes. The challenge for the existing non-stick coatings is even greater when application is needed for hard-to-reach areas, such as inside of oven chambers and pipes. The anticipated outcome of the Phase II proposal is an inorganics-based and PTFE-free non-stick coating that can provide more thermal-resistance than existing non-stick coatings and can be applied to different surfaces through a scalable and affordable route."

This work would result in a platform for 1) teaching students Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics and 2) providing them critical hands-on experience designing, prototyping, and programming machines. By enabling students to exercise their creativity via an intuitive design interface and a minimalist novel robot kit, this project advances the students' ability to innovate and invent machines and robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This framework would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. This project is closely aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce. The proposed design-driven educational robotics framework has the potential to fulfill these needs, improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology, and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

The proposed research seeks to develop a novel design-driven educational robotics framework encompassing 1) a modular, customizable, and compatible with off-the shelf electronics hardware kit consisting of rigid and compliant parts for rapid prototyping of robot structures and mechanisms, 2) a multi-modal mobile app for synthesis and simulation of robot motions, 3) a web-based CAD interface for designing users' custom robot parts that interface seamlessly with the kit, and 4) instructional material and curriculum for middle and high-schools. The hardware would provide a suite of planar parts with unique design capabilities to support creation of 3D geometry of robots and structures. The novel structural elements would give rise to a new method of enforcing geometric and kinematic constraints and provide flexibility in choice of material and manufacturing process. While the new connection methods are much more intuitive and simpler, they also closely mirror the way engineered structures are created in practice. The mobile app based on the latest mechanism synthesis research imbued with a multi-modal graphical user interface will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide necessary skills and experience in the design process.

Lack of access to community resources such as housing, food and transportation (also known as social determinants of health) has been associated with negative health outcomes such as unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency room visits. This leads to high healthcare costs. Therefore, healthcare teams (i.e. social workers, case managers and discharge planners) spend a significant amount of time to locate appropriate community resources for their patients. Our innovation will leverage a community of healthcare professionals and the resource providers to ultimately find community resources for patients in a faster and less costly manner. The machine learning technology supported by this award will connect healthcare professionals with relevant community resources that ultimately reduces the cost and time associated with this process. A successful implementation of this technology will lead to improved post-treatment care outcomes for the patients and reduced cost of care.  

The proposed project will develop and test the feasibility of a web-based software platform to empower healthcare professionals to share community resources. Novel machine learning technology will be developed to facilitate appropriate and efficient exchange of community resources. Healthcare professionals using the platform will be able to get onto the platform as well as search and share resources. The machine learning algorithm leverages the relationships of healthcare professionals and resource providers to coordinate community resource sharing. A successful implementation of this algorithm will provide substantial improvements on the ability to acquire timely community resources as compared current methods.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (> 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities."

An implantable micro-biosensor that reliably detects, monitors, and tracks alcohol consumption allows for more accurate diagnosis so the appropriate treatment solution can be prescribed and tracked. Our system integrates an implantable micro-biosensor with smartphone technology to continuously detect and monitor, collect, transmit, store, and analyze relevant biodata, pushing resulting behavior change instructions to the user.  This creates a revolutionary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol use disorders by reporting outcome data more accurately and reliably than current, self-reporting methods. Our system potentially yields multiple societal benefits, including lower treatment costs and increased treatment accessibility. Additionally, it could reduce both economic and social costs through the identification of people at risk thereby increasing the number of people who seek and receive treatment.  

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on refining the design and functionalization of an injectable alcohol micro-biosensor, developing a wearable device, and testing the alcohol micro-biosensor in animals. Once fully developed, our system for detecting, monitoring, and treating alcohol use disorders will consist of three components: 1) a multi-plex micro-biosensor, small enough to be directly injected under the skin. The sensor is customizable to continuously monitor and measure alcohol; 2) a wearable sensor device that provides power to the injected micro-biosensor while collecting the measured data to transmit to a nearby smartphone or other data aggregator; and 3) a mobile smartphone application developed by our company that uses evidence-based psychotherapy techniques to encourage behavior modification. The anticipated technical results include an implantable micro-biosensor for the continuous monitoring and measuring of alcohol consumption. Additionally, an unobtrusive wearable device that can power the biosensor and store and transmit the data collected is anticipated. Both of these components will have been tested in animals and be ready to move on to testing in humans.

The primary barrier to installation is the cost of trenching cable, which can be $7,000-$30,000 per service location. Similar challenges exist in emerging markets and remote industrial Internet of Things. Networks cannot easily be replaced with today?s wireless technologies due to the losses that occur when forwarding information wirelessly, which can eliminate up to half of the throughput capability at each forwarding location. Low-loss mesh networking, such as that proposed, would enable fully-wireless solutions to last-mile connectivity problems globally by eliminating reliance on cable. The impact of distributed and scalable algorithms extends beyond mesh networking into the decentralization of other technologies to be more secure and robust, but cannot due to performance issues.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on low-loss mesh networking that could feasibly cover hundreds or thousands of acres with broadband internet access without laying cable. The primary intellectual merits include scalable aggregation of data, reducing communication interference with a predetermined network structure, and other challenges that arise in very large wireless networks. The objective of this research is a wireless mesh network topology and hardware that can maintain less than 17% throughput loss-per-hop in a network larger than 100 nodes. This will be accomplished through real-world trials, simulations, and iterated testing of different geometries and time-domain multiplexing.

Such superior coatings are expected to have a potential market of billions of dollars. In automotive applications, coating the engine surfaces and the piston rings with the high-performance carbon films will improve the fuel efficiency and substantially reduce Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide emissions to benefit the environment. Broad applications of the low-friction and super-hard carbon coatings on cutting tools, bearings, glass, and electrodes will greatly reduce the manufacturing costs and the consumption of the earth's resources.  

This I-Corps project aims to determine the commercial viability of a patent-pending magnetically enhanced cathodic arc plasma technology that is capable of coating the inner and outer surfaces of working components, such as engine liners and bearings. This technology overcomes the limitation of line-of-sight in conventional physical vapor depositions. A properly designed magnetic field efficiently confines the arc plasma. A single arc current can reach over 100 Amps to locally vaporize the target materials. The evaporated particles have high kinetic energies, leading to excellent adhesion of the coatings to the substrate surfaces. When a graphite target is used, the energetic carbon species form strong bonds with a combination of multiple extreme properties: 1) a hardness value of over 6000 Vickers (close to diamond) compared with ~200 Vickers of 304 stainless steel; 2) a low friction coefficient of ~0.1, similar to the value of Teflon; and 3) a superior chemical inertness and resistance to corrosion.

Nontechnical abstract
This international research training program allows advanced undergraduates and junior graduate students to spend extended periods conducting field research on free-living African carnivores in Kenya, building on a strong long-term program of carnivore research in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Several students each year will undertake projects designed to acquire new and useful information about the carnivores inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, and to develop strong, long-lasting professional relationships with Kenyan scientists. A strong team of American and Kenyan trainers will help students address a broad array of research questions about the behavior, conservation and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to the effects of human activity on their stress physiology. Pairs of undergraduate and graduate students will be linked by topical research focus, and work closely with local experts. While in Kenya, students will receive explicit training in science writing, and present their work at an annual conference on carnivore biology sponsored by the Kenya Wildlife Service. The research opportunities offered to students here are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain very poorly understood, but also to make important contributions to behavioral ecology, stress physiology and conservation biology. The knowledge acquired in this research should facilitate conservation of African carnivores, and thus contribute to the economic well-being of Kenya, which is intimately linked with revenues from eco-tourism. This research program will also contribute significantly to the professional development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.

Technical abstract
The intellectual focus of this project is the behavioral ecology, physiology, and conservation of African carnivores.  Mammalian carnivores are critical to the stability and integrity of ecosystems around the world, largely because they play key roles in regulating such important ecosystem processes as interspecific competition and predator-prey dynamics.  Despite their importance, however, carnivores are in global decline due to a combination of habitat degradation and direct human persecution. In fact, today many carnivore populations are declining even within protected areas. It has become clear in recent years that our ability to conserve mammalian carnivores, including most of those in Africa, is limited by a dearth of knowledge about many aspects of their basic biology. This international research training program aims to fill these gaps in our knowledge in regard to African carnivores, and to apply that new knowledge to improving carnivore management; this program should thus ultimately facilitate carnivore conservation across the African continent. During the proposed funding period, students will use experimental and observational methods to test hypotheses suggesting 1) relationships among social complexity, foraging demands and general intelligence, 2) endocrine substrates of cooperative behavior, 3) how anthropogenic activities affect the behavior, physiology and demography of mammalian carnivores, and 4) best carnivore management practices. This is the only training program in the United States where both undergraduate and graduate students can obtain field research experience investigating the biology of free-living African carnivores. Most past participants in this program have reported their experiences in Kenya to be life-changing, setting them on trajectories of professional development they otherwise never would have dreamed possible."

Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a proposal for a Type II I-Corps Site - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.

During the first Site award, Michigan Tech was able to create a partnership with Western Michigan University, doubling the number of workshops offered and the number of teams participating in those workshops in one year. During the Site's next phase, Michigan Tech will offer Workshops each year and recruit teams to participate each year; increase the diversity of participants in the Workshops; expand the mentor pool to broaden participation of experienced mentors from academia, industry, and investment capital; continue to refine the I-Corps curriculum to best meet the needs of participating teams by offering a follow-up workshop in order to prepare teams for National I-Corps and to build and support communities of innovators; expand their interaction with the Midwest Node; revise the mini-grant process to encourage more teams to apply for these grants; and continue to build the local, regional, and state-wide innovation culture and ecosystem. The Michigan Tech Innovation Center for Entrepreneurship will use a cadre of Outreach Ambassadors to serve as advocates across campus and within their spheres of influence to help recruit high quality teams to participate in the I-Corps program. Project evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of specific curriculum improvements and on the impact of the project on the local, regional, and state innovation ecosystem and culture.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "This project creates an NSF I-Corps Site at Michigan Technological University.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

A typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Michigan Tech's innovation success looks to the Sites Program to achieve higher levels of translating innovations to market through a structured I-Corps Site approach, particularly at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Also, this project adapts and applies the recently developed Lean Start-up methodology as a means to strengthen their innovation ecosystem. By  introducing Lean Start-up methodology to I-Corps Site teams, as in the National Program, it is anticipated that there will be increased start-up business development and other commercialization initiatives, increased rate of success of those initiatives, and improved knowledge and skill development that will be used, shared, and perpetuated by all faculty, staff and student participants in current and future initiatives.  

Broader Impacts:
By strengthening their infrastructure and support systems with an I-Corps Site, Michigan Tech will be better positioned to contribute to the economic challenges of the country and their geographical region. Participation in NSF's I-Corps Site program will allow Michigan Tech to increase the reach of the program and contribute to the expansion of start-ups that are critical to the economic and employment growth required to survive and thrive in the 21st century."

"abstractText": "IRES: US-Denmark Collaboration to Create Next Generation Biosensors

There is a great need for the development of fast and simple detection devices for diseases ranging from cancer to malaria. Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases, it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities, and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.  Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught. This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18 highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. 

Today?s global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education, but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition, the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for others to seek out international research opportunities."

"abstractText": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.  Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  

The proposed project seeks to double the area of the spinal cord which can receive therapeutic benefit, by developing an active stimulation-grid electrode grid technology.  By positioning a very small electronic circuit within the paddle electrode, the team is expected to create a 64 contact therapy array to deliver precision therapy.   To accomplish these goals, the project includes three critical tasks including:  (1) develop a medical-grade design of the implantable electronics, package, and lead array, (2) perform mechanical aging and stretch testing, and (3) prepare prototypes for subsequent ISO 14708 validation testing.  The goal of the project is to accelerate the medical-grade hardware development effort to enable future therapies to treat low-back pain.  Eventual validation after this project is completed will be performed in humans by selectively applying stimulation and recording if the patient feels therapy in the low-back area."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae.

This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation, we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial acceptance in schools throughout the US. 

This project is designed to provide simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade, using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions, both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting higher math applications and scientific discovery."

Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays."

Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.  It is clear from data they have provided that a Site at this institution would have a significant impact on the university and the region as well as the faculty and students at this institution."

The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.

This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers. Discoveries from this project will inform the decision of the next step towards a startup and commercialization.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This Site at M S&T integrates education and research with cutting-edge applications to create and convey knowledge that serves the State of Missouri and the nation, and helps solve societal challenges at global scale. The Site enhances the university strategic plan which requires experiential learning as an integral component of undergraduate curricula to foster innovation and creativity. In addition, the I-Corps Site encourages a large number of untapped STEM talents and provides institutional support for commercialization. The complementary, on-campus Student Design and Experiential Leaning Center is also leveraged to develop student entrepreneurs and accelerate their business ideas to the market place. 

By providing targeted seed funds for commercialization efforts, the I-Corps Site enhances existing programs at S&T, improves visibility of entrepreneurship, and expands participation in existing technology transfer programs. Thirty teams per year receive I-Corps Site funding to translate ideas and research to the marketplace. The Site entrepreneurial education program is based on the I-Corps curriculum with experiential, collaborative learning and uses the Lean LaunchPad methodology. The Site objectives are to: 
(1) Enhance entrepreneurial activities and training experiences for undergraduate and graduate students at S&T; 
(2) Expand training opportunities available to post docs, faculty, underrepresented groups using LLP model; 
(3) Increase the number of teams entering the I-Corps program, entrepreneur fellows at the University of Missouri System and S&T, and VentureWell E-Teams; and 
(4) Transition more activities to commercialization. 
Teams are recruited from existing and new entrepreneurial student activities, course projects, research, and participants in local and regional venture competitions and entrepreneurship events.

The I-Corps Site impacts the Midwest region and Central Missouri where S&T is located. Rolla and its surrounding rural areas are remote and in need of economic resurgence. The I-Corps Site catalyzes activities to create a critical mass of innovators and entrepreneurs to establish a local technology hub and economic base and engage civic leaders and other stakeholders. The Site also serves as a bridge for collaboration with more mature startup communities and developed economic bases in St Louis and Kansas City. The Site provides fertile ground for experiential training of students from nearby community colleges, middle schools, and high schools through entrepreneurship courses, seminars, workshops, innovation camps and competitions, and other outreach activities. Special attention is being paid to recruit and involve female and underrepresented minority students in this program; the activities of which will be widely disseminated through various mechanisms including a dedicated website, newsletters and other social media."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at optimizing production of a bio-surfactant in preparation for commercial launch of the product.  During Phase I, the company developed an engineered microorganism that synthesizes the surfactant, and a key customer confirmed the identity and purity of a sample of the surfactant.  During Phase II, synthetic biology methods will be used to increase the efficiency of the microorganism producing the surfactant.  In addition, multiple samples of purified surfactant will be shipped to customers for evaluation.  Customer feedback will identify any product features that require modification and will result in development of a detailed product specification, which will include metrics such as:  purity, color, acceptable variation in composition and molecular weight, etc.  The objectives of this Phase II project are to optimize surfactant characteristics and microbial production efficiency so that the surfactant can be profitably manufactured and sold for use in consumer products formulations.
  

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it should enable the company to demonstrate that synthetic biology methods can be used to increase the efficiency of production of a bio-surfactant so the surfactant can be sold as a commercial product.  Progress toward that goal should enable the company to attract a partner, for example a large chemical company, who will agree to collaborate on commercialization of the bio-surfactant.  If the bio-surfactant can be made and sold profitably, the company will be positioned to fund future research and development aimed at commercial launch of additional bio-surfactants.  Benefits to society are that chemicals produced using this technology will be manufactured using domestically grown renewable raw materials, which do not compete with food.  Furthermore, the energy required to produce these chemicals is low since the fermentation reaction is performed near ambient temperature.  The chemicals are inherently safer than traditional chemicals because toxic solvents are not used, and the surfactants are biodegradable and do not contribute to increased greenhouse gas accumulation.  These bio-surfactants will initially be used in personal care products, such as body washes and shampoos.  However, the surfactant market is large and diverse, creating an opportunity for use of bio-surfactants in products as varied as laundry detergent, paints and coatings, and floatation-agents used in the mining industry to purify valuable minerals."

For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer, virtual reality, watches, etc.) OLED is superior to all existing technologies in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting, OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.  The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing will enable this advancement. 

The proposed project will reduce OLED cost and improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.  The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous and non-crystallizable in all three layers.  These molecules are chemically designed to meet all the required photophysical and electrical characteristics necessary for superior OLED performance.  Preliminary device fabrication and testing has confirmed that these new materials dramatically improve both emission efficiency and device lifetime with the standard emitter molecules.  Due to the physics of charge recombination in the emitter layer there is only one technology which has the potential to harvest 100% of the injected charge as emitted light:  thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF).  OLEDs using TADF technology have demonstrated high efficiency but with very short device lifetime.  This project will couple the new non-crystallizable technology with TADF to design and fabricate OLED devices with both high efficiency and long life to meet commercialization requirements.

It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with 10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection, power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. 

The work of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption, low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone. In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product. The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project stems from the need to substantially improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency in crop production and thereby improve profitability for farmers, while simultaneously reducing the adverse effects of agriculture on the environment.  Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide new opportunities for purifying waters that cannot be economically treated using existing commercial membranes.  Increased market growth to include recycle and re-use of contaminated water that is currently slated for disposal or long term environmentally risky storage will increase water availability for industry and agriculture and reduce environmental impact from these same users.  More available water, especially in higher demand locations, will lead to higher production and lower costs for industrial and agriculture based consumers, leading to job growth.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate a new method of thin film composite membrane fabrication using new materials strategies to produce game changing anti-fouling and chlorine resistant reverse osmosis membranes.  Current market dominating polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes are inherently susceptible to fouling and degraded by chlorine disinfectants used to mitigate bio-fouling, which is the greatest challenge to membrane operation.  The established TFC production technique provides very thin active layers on the order of 100?s of nanometers but is limited to polyamides.  The proposed technology will produce TFCs with alternative polymers.  Polymers that are chlorine resistant and inherently non-fouling are targeted for use but the unmet challenge has been the opportunity to manufacture them with membrane thicknesses down to the 100?s of nm thickness regime necessary to challenge the flux properties of current commercial membranes.  Combining this new fabrication technology and new polymers is the technological breakthrough needed to develop innovative membranes.  The project will synthesize a target polymer composition, develop the formulation and fabrication parameters within the new process and produce TFC samples for testing.  TFC samples will undergo comparative testing of fouling and chlorine resistance, water flux and salt rejection in a variety of simulated test waters.

After its qualification, 3D TSV selective metallization technology will enable fabrication of high performance 3D microsystems at lower cost by replacing costly damascene interconnect technology with selective electrochemical metallization technology for TSV metal fill, bump and redistribution layer formation.  The successful completion of this project would have a significant societal impact by accelerating 3D IC wafer technology adoption into state-of-art high performance digital devices such as next generation of smart phones. This project will also have positive economic impact by creating US semiconductor jobs and maintaining US technology leadership over a wide range of electronic applications and consumer electronic devices.	

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project advances a novel three-dimensional through-silicon vias (TSV) selective metallization technology to fabricate low cost and scalable 3D integrated circuits (IC). Physical and economical limitations for two-dimensional scaling (so called "Moore?s Law") prevent further increase of integration density to improve the performance of IC. These challenges have stimulated the development of 3D TSV technology (so called "More than Moore") in order to increase the speed and bandwidth of the devices as well as to decrease the form factor and power consumption of integrated microsystems. However, the mass adoption of 3D IC is limited by the high cost of 3D TSV interconnects (due to the use of expensive vapor deposition and chemical-mechanical damascene processes) and its poor scalability (due to low conformality of physical and chemical vapor deposited films) to high aspect ratios and smaller via sizes. Proprietary and patented 3D TSV selective metallization technology developed during Phase I project will be further optimized and qualified on production tools to address cost and scalability issues of 3D TSV interconnects. Enabling low cost and scalable 3D ICs will allow heterogeneous systems integration for next generation smart phones and other consumer electronic devices."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a low cost Lidar+Thermal camera to the autonomous car market that will eventually enable level 4 and level 5 autonomy. The proposed innovation incorporates both a Lidar and a thermal detector to locate objects but also classify them, as this is the most crucial aspect of autonomous vehicles. The dual polarity Lidar+Thermal photodetector solves a few major issues in the current Lidar industry. First, current Lidars have to use advanced algorithms to classify the objects, whereas a Lidar+Thermal detector can easily distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, while continuing to establish their location. This is done due to the drastic heat signature of animate objects. Second, the dual polarity detector is able to detect and locate hazards on the road such as snow or puddles, which is vital if autonomous vehicles are used in northern regions. In addition, the frame rate of the Flash Lidar+Thermal is up to 200 Frames per second, which will drastically reduce smearing effects and allow for driving at speeds of 70+ MPH. Lastly, the high thermal resolution of the camera will ensure operation in bad weather conditions including fog and rain.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept of the dual polarity Lidar+Thermal detector. An array of 32x32 pixels will demonstrate that in one polarity, a thermal hot-mid-wave image and in the other polarity the pixels will operate in a time-of-flight mode for Flash Lidar operation. The pixel?s spectral response will range from 500nm up to 3.5?m in the Lidar mode. Characterization of the detector array will use the eye-safe 1550nm laser. The goal is to show a 200m Lidar operation with a high resolution of a few centimeters and thermal imaging with a thermal sensitivity of 4mK. The transition to Phase II will include an array size of 1000x500 with 10?m pixel pitch. The detector will be evaluated outdoors to demonstrate the detection of animate objects, snow and puddles and will be tested under fog conditions.

"abstractText": "This Small Technology Transfer Phase I project will realize a sensorized soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with an interactive 3D virtual reality (VR) gaming environment that provides fine motor training for stroke patients' hands. There is a currently a lack of available devices that provide fine sensory and motor training of the hand. The potential benefit is to fill this niche market opportunity, especially when considering the high incidence of hand disability due to stroke and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries. This system can provide structured therapy sessions which requires minimal therapist supervision while improving patient engagement which enhances the broader participation. As a complimentary technology for current rehabilitation practice, it has a potential to lower health care and labor costs associated with neurological rehabilitation. The outpatient physical rehabilitation market is a $30 billion industry growing at a rate of 7% in the US, mainly due to the growing elderly population. The robot-assisted rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by 2020. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available, the customer base will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally to home-based care. 

The intellectual merit of this project results from the combination of a soft robotic system with fine motor control synced to VR games for both sensory and motor stimuli. The robotic exoskeleton provides individual joint control to practice complex grasping while the VR environment provides targeted rehabilitation games. This system addresses the fine motor control needs that have not been met by current hand rehabilitation devices, which only offer gross motions. Adaptive algorithms will adjust to the patient's level of ability to accomplish the assigned tasks in virtual game scenarios, providing accessibility for a wide range of population with different levels of severity. There are three main goals for the project. First, we will develop a VR environment simulating real-world hand motion via interaction with objects in an immersive game. Second, we will develop adaptive control algorithms for the soft robotic exoskeleton to provide active assistive motion in performing rehabilitation-oriented tasks in the VR environment. Third, a pilot study will be conducted with both healthy individuals and hand-impaired stroke patients. The Phase I project will produce a system with assistive hand motion in a targeted rehabilitation virtual game environment, which can be tested for efficacy in a larger clinical population of stroke survivors.

Current solutions (typically available only at facilities with trained professionals) assess only significant health changes to cognition. In contrast, our solution provides an affordable, reliable way to measure brain health and to monitor changes after treatment, training, and rehabilitation. Thus, it will be an excellent tool other companies can use to assess various interventions aimed at affecting brain function. The "quantified self" market sells technologies (wearables, DNA tests, software) that collect data to inform and guide health and self-improvement. The total addressable global market is estimated at ~$19B for 2019. The initial target market of customers are those seeking a competitive athletic edge by measuring, tracking, and training cognitive abilities such as reaction time, decision-making, and multitasking. These customers are coaches in high schools, colleges, and high-performance gyms across the US.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need to combine and harness the power of eye-, hand-, and head-tracking instruments, virtual reality, and cognitive neuroscience to accurately measure and monitor brain function. This Phase I SBIR project will complete four technical objectives: (1) to develop a highly controlled testing environment that can accurately measure the time users (athletes) spend on detecting, processing, and acting on different cognitive tasks; (2) to develop software that can collect reliable data from naturalistic inputs; (3) to develop a set of tasks that users can complete within 30 minutes and that will generate sufficient data for analysis; and (4) quickly process, summarize, and contextualize the collected data and report meaningful results to the athletes and their trainers. Successful completion of these objectives will realize a first-of-its-kind product that provides meaningful insight into the brain with laboratory-quality cognitive assessment in a real-world context.

From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

Compared to competitive products (e.g., packed resin beads or microfiber adsorption membranes), these nanofiber membranes/felts will provide greatly enhanced throughput (i.e., shorter processing times), reduce the amount of waste generated, and decrease the volume of media required (i.e., lower costs and smaller operating footprints) for purification of high-value biopharmaceutical products. The SBIR Phase I project was completed successfully by developing a manufacturing process for the functionalized nanofiber felts and proving superior performance compared to commercial products. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on further optimization of the formulations used during production of the nanofiber adsorbents for bioseparations. This will include two scale-up steps needed for the commercial manufacturing effort anticipated during the Phase II timeline (nanofiber felt production, surface functionalization, and module development). Key technical improvements, including greater product stability and a broader array of functional ligands needed in bioseparations, will continue to be made to the nanofiber felts/mats. 

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project goes well beyond bioseparations. Due to the many advantages of the surface-functionalized electrospun nanofibers made from regenerated cellulose, this innovative adsorption material has tremendous commercial potential. Customers will come from companies within the biopharmaceutical industry, as well as from the established manufacturers of bioseparations adsorption media. Additionally, the underlying fundamentals associated with nanofiber adsorption media will have a wide range of implications, including more efficient separation processes in the water purification industry and the blood products and/or blood purification industries. The advantages achieved through this innovative work will lead to more efficient separation technologies across many sectors and include faster processes, reduced energy consumption, lower materials requirements, and less waste generation. In addition to the broader scientific impacts, Nanofiber Separations, LLC is committed to creating jobs and to training highly technical staff members, providing them with expertise in the interdisciplinary fields of advanced functional materials (including nano-scaled materials) and/or biotechnology."

Through this project, VentureWell connects national programs to form the "National Innovation Network" (NIN). This emerging community of innovators represents a key component of NSF's I-Corps programs. With the NIN, NSF accelerates the development of a national innovation ecosystem that reaches deeply and broadly across the country to engage the most creative and consequential research discoveries and talents in the process of entrepreneurship. The NIN is composed of clusters of universities that support the I-Corps  Nodes -- the primary training group for the I-Corps national course teams; the I-Corps Sites -- that include the individual institutions dedicated to spurring on very early stage teams; the Teams -- that focus on market validation of technology innovations; and organizational stakeholders such as mentors who support the teams, and venture development partners such as angel investors, venture capitalists and other types of investors.

The role of VentureWell in the advancing of the NIN involves seven primary activities:
     1. Commission teaching teams for eleven NSF I-Corps National Team Trainings
     2. Implement I-Corps Faculty Training
     3. Convene an I-Corps Faculty Summit
     4. Design and implement Teaching Assistant Training
     5. Organize and implement the annual National Innovation Network conference that brings together all of the Nodes and Sites
     6. Prepare, disseminate and archive the curriculum and curate best practices for pedagogical improvements
     7. Conduct Ongoing Course Evaluation

A particular focus of this project is VentureWell's research and assessment of formative and summative evaluation of I-Corps Team experiences in cohorts as well as related dissemination activity. The formative evaluation is designed to understand participants' satisfaction with the cohort and course and perspective on the course environment, to understand the quality of instruction, and to assess knowledge gains. The evaluation involves the administration, response rate monitoring, data collection, and cleaning of four surveys: (i) pre-course, (ii) after kickoff, (iii) after week-3 of course weekly webinars, and (iv) post-course. The summative evaluation is designed to track individual and team outcomes of interest to NSF and assess the impact of the course at approximately one year and 3.5 years after formal participation in the program ends. Finally, dissemination activities are designed to ensure that key program information is shared with appropriate audiences. In addition, VentureWell is creating public-use datasets. These datasets contain de-identified data from the pre-course, post-course and longitudinal outcomes surveys in order to disseminate information about the program to the I-Corps research community and allow others to use these data in their research."

This NSF project will support the evaluation of I-Corps program outcomes and tracking of program impact in a systematic and timely way.  This work is important to the operation of a consistent, high-fidelity program at scale and to the measurement of long term program results and an understanding of what works. The core intellectual merit of this work is insight into the program's impact, both economic outcomes and participants' career and research outcomes, over time. To gain this insight, the project evaluates the delivery of each cohort, administers a longitudinal outcomes survey, and tracks venture outcomes independently to verify program impact data. Working with NSF, the project makes these datasets accessible to the research community to enable the continued study of how best to support emerging science and technology innovation. The processes and data systems that efficiently track outcomes and provide insights into the development of technology-based products and ventures are a product of this project, as well.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the immediate need to develop advanced air conditioning technology that increases energy efficiency and will have a significant and positive impact on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. As Room Air Conditioning (RAC) demand increases by an estimated 5x over the next 30 years, it is crucial that newly established scientific and technological approaches be developed which lessen the requirement of 'peaker' power plants to supply electricity for their operation. Nativus is engineering an energy-efficient 12,000 BTU Room Air Conditioner (RAC) for residential and light-commercial consumers, capable of cooling 500 ft2. Through a complete architectural redesign, our proprietary technology offers customers a solution to their air conditioning needs which is cheaper to operate, quieter, filters the air, and is easier to install than currently available commercial offerings.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, rotating air conditioning design which combines the main components of an air conditioner into a single, packaged device to drastically increase air conditioner performance.  The roughly one billion air conditioners in operation globally operate at 5-10% of their theoretical ultimate Carnot efficiency, as industry focuses on "first-cost" and has not demonstrated meaningful, radical improvements since the inception of the air conditioner. The current state-of-the-art technology in the HVAC industry is based upon the 'fan plus finned-tube' (FPFT) Heat Exchanger in which a fan blows air across either hot or cold heat exchanger fins. This architecture results in the formation of an insulative 'boundary layer', severely degrading heat exchanger performance. Through the use of one high-efficiency motor, instead of two or three motors commonly found on state-of-the-art technology, our proprietary design rotationally-shears the boundary layer from the surface of the heat exchanger, thereby increasing efficiency while decreasing power consumption. Our research objectives include air conditioner component and system-level validation, supported by three milestones which include Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) performance validation, system reliability through prototype testing, and economic analysis.  The tasks involved in our project include design, manufacture, assemble, and testing of a complete system.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR Phase I project is a sustainable fruit and vegetable processing technology utilizing a new, low temperature technique that can extend the shelf life of pre-cut fruits and vegetables by months without using preservatives, chemicals, freezing, or refrigeration.  The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste.  With significant percentages of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration, achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally. 

This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology. Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products. Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables, and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration of taste, texture, and nutritional quality.  Such a result would actuate follow-on development work to validate that, at commercial scale, the new process technology improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods. The market-ready product will be evaluated by eight preclinical immune cell research beta sites to discover new treatment pathways.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies.  As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with > $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space.  In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.  By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state.  This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run.

The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.  With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner.  Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere.  Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years.  The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

"abstractText": "This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

NJIT's I-Corps Site will enhance the quantity and quality of commercializable student and faculty research projects while complementing the existing innovation and entrepreneurship activities at the institution. The Site funding will catalyze and accelerate faculty and student efforts to commercialize original research and new technologies by providing financial support for prototypes and customer engagement. Lean Startup training will help teams discover their potential customers and product-market fit. 

NJIT's support for entrepreneurs has four main anchors: the Enterprise Development Center, a 100,000-sq.-foot high technology and life sciences business incubator; the newly established NJ Innovation Institute; the NJ Innovation Acceleration Center, an initiative of School of Management and the Office of Technology Development; and the NJIT Undergraduate Research and Innovation initiative where students form interdisciplinary teams and participate in experiential research activities that can solve societal problems.  An NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will help bridge one of the roadblocks to the commercialization of research by providing funds for the development of risky early-stage prototypes. Faculty/Student teams seeking financial support will be required to participate in Lean Startup training and entrepreneurial networking that will help them to transition from researchers to potential innovators and entrepreneurs. 

An NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will establish a robust pathway to market for original research and new technologies by cross-fertilizing academic, entrepreneurial, and corporate participation. The grant will further enhance NJIT's relationship with the entrepreneurial and corporate communities as we bring community members onto campus as mentors for the I-Corps Site teams. 

An I-Corps Site at NJIT will create pathway for underrepresented teams to participate in the NSF I-Corps program and support the mission of promoting science and technology to advance the national health. By combining academic research activities with commercialization activities, the I-Corp Site at NJIT will foster experiential teaching, training, and learning for students and faculty. Students and faculty who learn to discover the path to commercialization will be able to view research discoveries with greater understanding.

The Kauffman Foundation has recognized that minorities are underrepresented among entrepreneurs. All entrepreneurs face resource constraints but the barriers to entrepreneurship may be insurmountable for economically disadvantaged students and students who don't have a strong network from which to derive resources. An NSF I-Corp Site at NJIT will draw students from one of the most diverse campuses within the US and will provide early stage funding to women, minorities, and economically disadvantaged participants on a meritocratic basis. 

Leveling the playing field will broaden participation from underrepresented groups and create a new class of technology entrepreneurs and will benefit society by helping to move ideas out of academic silos. Nearly all net new job growth in the US has come from the formation of new companies and the subset of new companies that have grown most rapidly has been technology-based companies, the sorts of technology startups that would be fostered at NJIT."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to catalyze the development and commercialization of innovative nanobubble technologies in environmental, agricultural and other potential engineering applications. In environmental applications, reactive nanobubble technologies could impact water or wastewater treatment industries, municipal water treatment plants, drinking water disinfection, natural and landscape water management and remediation of impaired water bodies (e.g., by algal bloom). Value propositions include the improved water treatment efficiency (e.g., increased disinfection efficacy), reduced use of traditional hazardous chemicals such as chlorine, and reduced maintenance/operational cost in water remediation. In agricultural fields, irrigation with nanobubble water can significantly improve dissolved oxygen in water by 100-5000% and efficiently deliver oxygenated water and growth elements such as nitrogen to plant roots. Thus, the value propositions include improving crop or plant's growth, health and quality. Moreover, nanobubble water can positively affect turf and grass business and promote reduced or chemical-free fertilization in turf or lawn maintenance and therefore increase ecosystem safety and reduce negative environmental impacts.  

This I-Corps project explores fundamental engineering principles of colloidal bubble systems at nanoscale dimensions. Innovative scientific approaches employ reactive nanobubbles to control and mitigate water pollution as well as support smart agricultural irrigation/fertilization. Specifically, nanobubble technologies are processes that generate ultra-small sizes of bubbles with a diameter of < 1 um dispersed in water or other liquid media. Nanobubbles in water have a long residence time in water due to their low buoyancy and excellent stability against coalesces, collapse or burst, and the formation of bulk bubbles. Therefore, compared to regular bulk or large bubbles, nanobubbles have a higher efficiency of mass transfer due to their high surface areas, which also facilitates physical adsorption and chemical reactions in the gas-liquid interface. Therefore, nanobubble technologies are potentially useful in many industrial and engineering applications, ranging from ultra-sound imaging and intracellular drug delivery, pharmaceutical manufacturing, detergent-free surface cleaning, mining separation, water purification to wastewater treatment. This I-Corps project focuses on the evaluation of unique business models in water pollution control and mitigation as well as irrigation for agricultural applications.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to revolutionize the music industry and related sectors such as game development and video production which significantly involve music. With the proposed music generation technology, copyright issues can be avoided since the music generated is completely original. Furthermore, compared to traditional composing methods which take at least an hour for the user or composer to produce a one-minute piece of music, the proposed technology spends only less than a minute to generate the music of the same length. These advantages will allow small game developers and self-media producers to generate original music that fit to their needs in a very short amount of time with minimum cost, which significantly benefits the game and self-media industries.

This I-Corps project features the technology of automatic music generation from user's humming based on AI and music theory. Without any professional knowledge of music, a user can simply start by humming a short melody. Combining the AI algorithm with music theory, the application completes other necessary musical components (such as chord progression, beats and tempo) and expands the short input melody into a full piece of music for which the user can change genre and do post-editing. The technical differentiators of the proposed technology are threefold. Firstly, a pitch detection algorithm is developed to recognize the user's humming tune and turn it into musical notes, which are then optimized to conform to music theory and logic. Secondly, a novel algorithm combining Recurrent Neural Network and music theory is developed to generate a full piece of music, including the main melody, chord progression, motive and accompaniment, based on the user's short input melody. Thirdly, the post editing stage allows the user to modify the notes and genre according to the generated chord progression.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with impacts on global markets that involve catalysts.  Catalysts influence many fields in science and technology such as material science, electrochemical processes, nano science and energy storage technologies.  These areas represent some of the most rapidly evolving global sciences and applications. The novel catalyst material that is the basis of this project will likely have commercial impact in global markets in that 60% of chemical synthesis and 90% of chemical transformations in chemical industries are currently dependent on the catalysts. According to the North American Catalysis Society, approximately 35% of global GDP depends on catalysts and the use of catalysts in the industry is increasing by 5% every year. With the growing market need of catalyst materials and the facile synthesis methodology for large scale production, this project's catalyst can be a potential game changer in the global market.

This I-Corps project is primarily intended to identify the market need and characterize the technological gap to commercialize a  recently developed nano catalyst based on metal-organic framework-modified nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G/MOF) for oxygen reduction reaction applications. The modification of the nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) catalyst by metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) has been developed to enhance the catalytic and electrochemical performance of N-G catalysts. The MOF-modified N-G catalyst (N-G/MOF) has high catalytic performance due to high surface area and porosity, which has better performance than the conventional precious group metal (PGM) catalyst. The innovative and economically viable synthesis method using nano high energy wet (NHEW) ball milling was developed for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene catalyst in room temperature environments. The NHEW ball milling synthesis method offers a long-term solution to the primary challenges generated during the high-temperature synthesis process, and serve as the primary synthesis method for the industry-scale production of the N-G/MOF catalyst in the future.

"abstractText": "The near-surface roof of volcanic systems is often considered geologically simple. Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved, providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds will document the project to share the overall experience of international research with a broad audience through public outreach programs. 

Through this 3-year project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of volcano anatomy. In the Jièín Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise (Èeský ráj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval times through today have unearthed many volcanoes to expose levels between 100 m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation, and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as: 1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry, exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.

This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

"abstractText": "This project, from New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Arrowhead Center, establishes an NSF I-Corps Site for the purpose of supporting university student and faculty research projects as they transition to the marketplace. 

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 
I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The NMSU I-Corps Site is housed at NMSU's economic development arm Arrowhead Center (Arrowhead). Through the I-Corps Site, Arrowhead created Aggie I-Corps, a five-week training program teaching Value Proposition Design and the Customer Discovery process. Aggie I-Corps provides teams with training, resources, networking opportunities, and seed funding to move their ventures towards the market, along with a range of follow-on funding through local competitions, NSF I-Corps, SBIR/STTR, and private investors. Aggie I-Corps is offered three times annually and serves a total of 30 teams per year. Teams are identified through a competitive application process intended to identify innovations across campus in areas typically funded by the NSF.

A novel aspect of the Aggie I-Corps program is the focus on Value Proposition Design as opposed to Business Model Design, which is the subject of most I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad programs. The purpose for the shift to Value Proposition Design is to focus on the two most challenging segments of Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. The core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.

NMSU and Arrowhead have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator. In the past two years, 80 new member startups were added, involving over 150 student entrepreneurs. This rapid growth signifies a large demand for entrepreneurship training at NMSU. Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding applications and private investment solicitations. 

Aggie I-Corps is having a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of Aggie I-Corps participants. The impact goes beyond the university and contributes to the regional ecosystem of entrepreneurship."

Compared to the existing drones in the market, the introduction of a multifunctional morphing drone will potentially reduce purchasing cost and storage space,  carry large payloads, maintain flight stability, and improve the endurance. This technology will potentially be useful in applications such as agriculture, wildlife, or forestry monitoring where there are large areas that need to be covered with high performance, large payload capacity and multi-mission capabilities.

This I-Corps project further develops a multifunctional morphing drone with spanning and sweeping capabilities. The novelty of this design originates from spanning and sweeping capability of the drone with boom stabilization during transitions. The main purpose of the offered concept is to design an optimal drone that can change its dimensions according to the defined mission. The stability in transition mode of morphing drones is one of the challenging steps for design and flight assessments. Consequently, a new concept that changes the dimensions of the wings and fuselage is proposed. This methodology can result in an improvement in the drones' performance, expansion in its flight range, enhancement of its stealth capability, reduction in drag, increase in its endurance and payload, and reduction in vibrational instability. The advantages of this design do not only come from the final expanded form, but also from the transitional phase. During the expansion of the wing, the center of gravity is independent of the increased spanning, especially in the case of an almost rectangular wing shape, which is not significantly altering the center of gravity position along the longitudinal axis.

NYU Tandon School of Engineering (NYU-SoE) Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will "encourage and support diversity in STEM entrepreneurship, among women in particular, by encouraging social entrepreneurship, an approach that has shown to be attractive to women." Using the Lean LaunchPad approach infused with insights into supporting diversity, teams will receive funding for customer discovery, prototyping, and other resources to support commercialization across multiple academic terms. This approach is supported by a strong network of faculty and mentors who have exhibited an excellent record of previous NSF funding and commercialization successes.

The intellectual merit of this proposal incorporates the proposition that social entrepreneurship is more attractive to underrepresented groups, particularly women. By pursuing avenues that will increase diversity in both STEM and entrepreneurship, through the training, programs, and mentorship of the site, this project may serve as an exemplar for I-Corps nationally."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of embedded machine listening as a low-cost, turnkey solution for early detection of machinery malfunction and improve predictive maintenance. In manufacturing, sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators, boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement in smart cities.

This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on deep learning.  Sound conveys critical information about the environment that often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.  Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools."

"abstractText": "Excellence in Research awards provide support for faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities to strengthen their research capacity.  The award to North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University has potential broader impact in a number of scientific and societal areas. The project will utilize a user-centered design methodology to conduct research that analyzes the unique gait characteristics of visually impaired individuals in the home, with consideration for the use of assistive devices or service dogs. This gait analysis and human factors research will facilitate an understanding of subjective factors, emotional status and aloneness for these visually impaired individuals. Finally, the research outcomes will support self monitoring such that the end users can be informed about the loneliness detection and assessment results through the use of accessible formats (e.g., voice user interfaces).  This research benefits the visually impaired, supports educational opportunities for students and advances knowledge in the use of human centered design research to address unique needs of those individuals with disabilities. 

The project is an ergonomics/human factors study that utilizes health informatics and data analytics to focus on advancing knowledge, technology, and human factors engineering principles to accurately assess human behavioral data in a natural environment (i.e. the home). The focus is on  analytical modules specifically designed for the inclusion of persons with disabilities (i.e. visual impairments).  The project objectives include conducting a user-centered contextual inquiry in a natural environment, developing the data collection, analysis, and report modules for the system using an iterative user-centered design approach, and finally, assessing the validity, reliability, and usability of the proposed system in an individual's natural environment.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "This proposal focuses on providing international educational and research opportunities in geosciences for US students and underrepresented minorities in a non-traditional study abroad destination, in this case Ethiopia. Only 4% of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including: increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and students at North Carolina A&T University (NCA&T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships that create the conditions for joint global projects. 

Ethiopia serves as an ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied. The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&T, Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between NCA&T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications, including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships between regional air quality and climate change."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve our understanding of the market forces that drive the need/use of antimicrobial materials. With ~1.7 million healthcare-associated infections causing upwards of 99,000 deaths annually in the United States, and adding about $30-45 billion to health care costs every year, the potential societal impact stemming from this proposed activity include a better understanding of the market forces that govern the need/use of antimicrobial materials. Understanding such forces will be important for the creation of the next generation of antimicrobial materials, and will impact the fields of materials and polymer science, textile engineering, packaging, and infectious disease (microbiology, virology) by providing performance guidelines in terms of material characteristics, physical properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. Food processing, packaging and service industries, waste water treatment, daycare facilities, and personal households are other potential areas that will benefit from this project. As such, given the potential commercial applications of platform antimicrobial technologies, narrowing the number of possible products and identifying a few key markets will be important for their commercialization, and this effort will be to better define the most viable products from which to commercialize platform antimicrobial technologies.

This I-Corps project aims to help the research team arrive at a go/no-go decision on whether to pursue commercialization of an anti-infective material: comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) into which are embedded photosensitizers (PS, chemical compounds that react with light and emit biocidal oxygen), this photoactive material, termed NFC-PS, is capable of the rapid, efficient, and low-cost sterilization of a wide range of infective agents, including drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, making it a platform technology from which to develop self-sterilizing materials. The intellectual merits of the proposed voice-of-customer research will establish the market-driven need for antimicrobial materials, including: i) to identify what customers and/or potential licensees would need in terms of anti-infective material properties (e.g. longevity, chemical resistance, integration into existing products, maximum cost or price points, EPA and/or FDA regulatory approvals); ii) to help identify potential products that could be improved by adding antimicrobial characteristics to them; and iii) to complete a business model canvas for the NFC-PS technology. Initial product ideation based upon the NFC-PS platform technology will be narrowed to 1-2 main products from a much broader number of market categories, and will be used to identify what prototype(s) should be developed along the path to commercialization.

In this IRES project, new generations of students will be taught to test hypotheses across species using cutting-edge tools in functional morphology and comparative biology,  subjects that are of interest to the great number of students interested in careers in STEM fields,  thus attempting to inspire this focal 21st Century work-force growth in a place that formed the foundation of the discipline over the last many centuries.  Approximately seven undergraduate students a year will be recruited from diverse backgrounds (including recruitment from colleges and universities that serve historically underrepresented groups) and trained in techniques that span live animal behavior, muscle dissection, analyses of bones, teeth and skulls and finally how to make inferences about the behavior and abilities of extinct species from the shapes of their fossils.  Not only will students learn these technical skills, but through working with senior professors and their international teams of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, they will learn the "soft skills" of collaborating across academic teams and cultures.  Students will gain these skills and earn authorship on professional presentations and potentially publications, giving them the possibly life changing experiences that may form the core of their continued pursuit of STEM interests and careers.

The overarching goal of this project is to train diverse cohorts of students in burgeoning 21st century functional morphology and comparative anatomy techniques.  Students will be trained in key techniques the US PI's lab (at North Carolina State University) prior to being accompanied to Paris to work in the lab of one of his collaborators at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle where they will have access to centuries-old collections and the other biological research institutions in the region.  There, with the mentorship of the professors and their senior postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the IRES students will develop independent or group projects that focus on modern approaches to functional morphology and comparative anatomy research questions.  These may include 1) behavioral research and experimentation at several zoological facilities (including access to a colony of mouse lemurs, or work with species like the greater bamboo lemur, that are not held in captivity outside of France), 2) dissection work with fresh specimens or specimens from the museum's expansive fluid collection, and analyses of osteological or dental material from 3) modern species or 4) the famous fossil collections also housed in this historically significant museum collection.  These studies may ultimately allow the IRES students to use this knowledge about the behavior and anatomy of extant species to evaluate the adaptations of extinct species.

"abstractText": "IRES: Vertically Integrated Team for Structural DNA NanoTech in Denmark

	This project sponsors a vertically integrated team (diverse members from education levels spanning high school through post-doctoral) of 5 or 6 participants per year from North Carolina for travel to Aarhus University in Denmark to pursue month-long research projects. Scientifically, the research project will advance the engineering of biological macromolecules (DNA and proteins) for formation of materials with their structures controlled on the nanometer length scale. The team leader will recruit participants from groups commonly underrepresented in science and engineering disciplines including minority and female students. This international research training experience will provide participants with unique opportunities to enlarge their scientific networks and to experience first-hand the benefits of cultural mixing. The project is important and deserves NSF funding, because it will develop molecular tools as well as scientific personnel capable of advancing nanoscience goals critical to the electronics and medical fields. US participants will benefit from significant scientific and social interactions with foreign students and faculty on-site in Denmark. The project will produce significant outcomes including cutting-edge research results and impactful research training experiences for participating American students. The senior investigators involved have received funding through the Danish National Research Foundation which primarily funds Danish students both in Denmark and on visits to the NCSU lab. IRES funding complements the Danish investment by allowing US students to participate in research at Aarhus.

	The project's scientific focus will be on the development of self-assembling DNA nanostructures and on their application toward nanofabrication of electronic, photonic, and biomedical devices. The NCSU team has used DNA as a building material to implement molecular computers, and to organize proteins and metallic nanoparticles with molecular-scale precision, while the Aarhus team is expert in DNA-guided chemistry for programmed synthesis of very large organic molecules. Developing ways to control matter on the nanoscale by exploiting the same construction principles used by biology (i.e. molecular recognition) holds great promise for diverse nanofabrication and biomedical applications. Engineered supramolecular complexes comprised of DNA, polypeptides, and inorganic nanomaterials provide the right length scale, range of physicochemical interactions, and complexity of shapes for interfacing effectively with biological structures. As such, DNA nanotechnology represents a perfect approach for creating custom diagnostic and ?smart? therapeutic agents for medical applications. Likewise, these same principles and materials are ideal for developing bionanofabrication procedures to compete with lithography for generation of electronic devices and circuits. Pursuit of biomimetic materials science, including molecular engineering for bottom-up assembly of complex nanostructures with diverse chemical, biological, photonic, or electronic functions, requires highly interdisciplinary teams. This cross-disciplinary work will therefore provide opportunities for very broad-based educational experiences to the participants. The cross-pollination provided by IRES funded international travel will lead to molecular materials engineering advances which could impact many fields of science and technology through applications in low-power nanoelectronics, programmable nanochemistry, novel biosensors, and smart therapeutics for biomedicine."

The goal is to contribute to a diverse and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce by providing eighteen U.S. student participants, six annually, with the opportunity to pursue mentored research on wide bandgap materials, i.e., nitride and oxide semiconductors materials.  At the Czech partners' institute, each participant will gain hands-on experience with advanced characterization techniques.  Overall, the research objectives of this IRES project are to study the fundamental and growth related properties of novel wide bandgap semiconductor materials, to identify current technology challenges, and investigate approaches for problem solving.  Such materials are of interest because they exhibit promise for future use in devices that would be capable of operating at high power and high frequency, and in harsh atmospheric conditions or biocompatible environments.  

Under the direction of Principal Investigator Tania Paskova and her Czech counterparts, participant research activities span materials science, surface science, semiconductor physics, and chemistry.  The intent is to work cooperatively to increase our fundamental understanding of the inherent electrical, optical and surface properties of wide bandgap materials as well as their modifications, following a variety of chemical treatments to examine their potential and limitations for energy and biosensing applications.  The new knowledge and improved understanding of the surface properties, polarity, and doping effects in wide bandgap materials with different crystallographic alignments are expected to contribute to future applications, including power electronics, optoelectronics, and chemical and biological sensors. The early career international research experience will expose the U.S. students to current technology challenges and increase their awareness of the importance of novel materials for areas essential to our future quality of life."

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This Site leverages Northeastern's entrepreneurship ecosystem as well as that of the larger Boston innovation ecosystem. The foundation for the program is a growing body of funded research which offers untapped opportunities for commercialization. To facilitate entrepreneurship, Northeastern created a series of entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as an on-campus incubator feeding ventures into the local investment community.

The Northeastern I-Corps Site program substantially increases both the quantity and quality of STEM-related ventures founded through its Site. The I-Corps Site program also leverage Northeastern's technology licensing office as well as its Mentor and Investors Networks in support of Site teams. There are 280 active individual Mentors supporting Northeastern's startups, as well as a variety of angel and venture capital investors who regularly assess Northeastern ventures, fifty of which have garnered $70 million in venture finance over the past three years. 

Northeastern University's entrepreneurship system is based on the meta-process of Educate, Incubate, and Launch. The I-Corp Site program is a highly focused way to a) better recruit a specific graduate, postdoc, and faculty population of potential technological entrepreneurs, and b) provide initial entrepreneurship and innovation education and training for them. Northeastern is also conducting research to more clearly understand the effect of entrepreneurial learning for first time entrepreneurs in its own incubator, focusing on the specific areas of developing customer insight, new product and service solutions, and business models. Several I-Corp ventures are already part of this study.

Northeastern's Site goals are to increase the number and quality of technology ventures emerging from laboratories and to feed new ventures into the I-Corps National program. Another important impact is that I-Corps offers a complementary pathway for early stage ventures to pursue initial funding through I-Corps Node and SBIR/STTR programs. Another potential impact is the expansion of this program in subsequent years to early stage entrepreneurs working in the numerous research environments within one mile of the Northeastern campus. These institutions include the medical schools and hospitals affiliated with Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University, as well as organizations pursuing research in robotics, cybersecurity, and IoT among other STEM areas."

Premature birth is globally the number one cause of death in children under the age of 5, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) being the leading cause of these deaths. RDS is usually addressed by using a bCPAP (bubble continuous positive airway pressure) machine that provides the baby with a humidified blend of air and oxygen at a controlled temperature and pressure. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art, low-cost bCPAP machine that aids preterm babies in low to middle income countries. While bCPAP devices are standard in wealthy nations, their $8-10k cost often makes them unaffordable for countries with fewer resources.

This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a novel bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) machine.  Some of the innovative features of this device include a cassette format for ease of maintenance and repair, a battery backup for uninterrupted care, robust component selection for extended lifetime use and a drug delivery add on for potential treatment of comorbidities. If successfully implemented, this product would potentially help provide quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations and reduce premature deaths due to respiratory distress syndrome."

The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit YNU over a period of eight (8) weeks. The project will enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on next-generation superconducting electronics, in collaboration with their faculty mentors in YNU. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. Through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the research of superconducting electronics, on the culture in Japan, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through the personal social media, Web 2.0 based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for local schools. It will be beneficial for the STEM and underrepresented student education as well as the advancing of superconducting and semiconductor industry in U.S.

Being widely-known for low energy dissipation and ultra-fast switching speed, Josephson Junction-based superconductor logic families have been proposed and implemented to process analog and digital signals. It has been perceived to be important candidate to replace state-of-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency. The project contains well-planned recruitment, preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research address fundamental problems in the circuit design, electronic design automation, and applications in superconducting electronics that need to be addressed urgently. The first project deals with the integration of AQFP technology with the efficient implementation of deep learning systems, where the latter is a core research topic in hardware and AI. The second project deals with efficient design of AQFP and RSFQ superconducting circuits and will greatly enhance the performance, efficiency and reliability. The third project aims to develop a design automation toolflow of superconducting electronics, which is currently lacking and will significantly reduce the development time of superconducting circuits. It is anticipated that with the close interaction with YNU, the breakthroughs made from these projects can have a significant impact on future superconducting electronics development and supercomputing systems, as well as the technology in the U.S. in corresponding areas.

This IRES project will partner with premier universities in Estonia to train students in interdisciplinary field-based environmental science methods in order to develop archives of past temperature and precipitation changes from the Baltic region. Each year the project will involve initial orientations, 5 weeks of international summer field and lab-based instruction, follow-up laboratory work at home institutions during the academic year, and conference presentations in the spring. A total of 4 students (undergraduate and graduate) and 1 in-service public science teacher (RET) each year will be recruited, and all the undergraduate participants will be from 2 year colleges in northern Illinois. Students from underrepresented groups will be targeted, and at least one undergraduate student per year will be from a non-STEM background.

This project will apply a multi-proxy approach to explore the timing and causes of historic climate variability in northern Europe. Student projects will be interrelated to develop a better understanding of how shifting Northern Hemisphere temperatures and mean-state conditions of the North Atlantic Ocean have influenced the climate dynamics of the eastern Baltic region. These datasets will serve as predictive tools for future variation across the Northern Hemisphere. Student projects will focus on lake sediment geochemistry (stable isotopes - ?18O and ?13C), paleoecology, and biology as tools to reconstruct past climate conditions. The educational goals are to: 1) Engage students in societally-relevant scientific topics to promote interest in STEM fields; 2) Mentor participants in state-of-the-art scientific research methods to better prepare them for STEM majors, careers, and advanced degrees; 3) Develop participants written and oral communication skills through mentoring and public presentations; and 4) Recruit underrepresented minority students and in-service public science teachers to promote diversity and sustainable impacts in public schools.

"abstractText": "Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will address a problem of poor oxygen delivery to the core of artificial tissues by providing reliable means of three-dimensional oxygen mapping in vitro and in vivo. The field of tissue engineering regenerative medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and organs is at par with curing cancer. Almost every part of the human body has been considered for replacement. Tissue engineering strives to solve arthritis, Type I diabetes, stroke, vascular diseases, liver and kidney damages, and many other medical problems by replacing or restoring damaged tissues or organs with artificial functional tissues. This project will address the problem of poor oxygen transport in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure, by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment over the time of graft production and upon implantation and develop better artificial tissues. The oxygen imager uses cutting-edge radiofrequency and magnet technology and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. 

The oxygen imager will be based on the innovative noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen imaging (EPROI) technology. EPROI uses an injectable water-soluble, non-toxic contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within 1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720 MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging. The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration, data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded biomaterials. It is expected that the oxygen imager will become an essential tool in tissue engineering labs of academic institutions and biotech companies and will have a major impact on the successful development of regenerative medicine therapies.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop single cell analysis technology to provide insight into cellular mechanisms, which has the potential to transform drug development and manufacturing. Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will support the research and development of a new medical device designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in the veins and is a common complication in hospital patients that is also a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. This project will develop a device that modifies blood flow patterns in the legs in a new manner designed to specifically activate genetic changes inside the vein that protect against blood clot formation. The goal of this project is to generate a new device that it is capable of creating the desired blood flow patterns in patients while maintaining a high level of device comfort, reliability, and ease of use for clinical staff and patients. In addition to preventing death and disability in the hospitalized population of the US, this project will move a new device towards commercial production, thereby supporting economic growth, job formation, and tax revenue. 

This SBIR Phase I project will leverage novel molecular and cellular discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to create a more effective device to prevent DVT in immobilized individuals who are at high risk for the disease. DVTs form in the sinus behind venous valves, where blood flow is reduced during immobility, promoting blood clot formation. This site is typically protected against clot formation by a powerful genetic program in the endothelial cells that is unique to the valve sinus microenvironment. Loss of this genetic expression program results in a prothrombotic environment that supports clot formation and DVT. Research has further revealed that the valve sinus anti-thrombotic genetic program is activated by a specific pattern of venous blood flow at that site that is driven by muscular activity. During prolonged periods of immobility, common during hospitalization, loss of this flow profile extinguishes the protective endothelial phenotype and supports DVT formation. Ultrasound analysis reveals that current mechanical therapy devices marketed to prevent DVT do not generate the hemodynamics at the valve that are produced by muscular activity due to their methods of action. This project will develop a device that generates a protective hemodynamic pattern in the valve sinus of immobile patients by actuating blood flow that accurately reproduce muscular activity. To accomplish this goal the device design alters the primary physical manipulation strategy of other existing devices away from calf and thigh compression and instead induces rapid calf expansion to replicate the effect of muscular activity on venous blood flow. Vascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that this actuation method successfully recapitulates the venous hemodynamics of the active limb required to support expression of the protective genetic pathway in the valve sinus. This SBIR Phase I project will optimize the device design to create this actuation while also improving patient comfort, mitigating common risks, and facilitating ease of use by clinical staff. This project will address key risks in advancing a medical device into clinical testing and use, thereby enabling the device to bridge to a phase of commercial manufacturing and use.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to broader adoption of newer medical technologies and increased revenue for medical device companies, decreased training costs, and decreased liability from misuse or lack of appropriate training on medical devices. Research has shown that surgical skill is directly related to a variety of patient outcomes, yet there are few tools that can reliably and affordably measure surgical proficiency. Providing objective measurements of surgical proficiency is not enough; the assessment method must also identify areas of difficulty during a task to improve the surgeon's future performance. The proposed innovation is an objective and scalable way to measure procedural competency using head and hand motion-tracking data collected in a surgical simulation and applying novel, deep-learning algorithms to the analysis. By providing surgeons with real-time feedback during training, this project will allow surgeons to rapidly improve training on specialized devices, thus leading to wider adoption of new technology. Adoption of this surgical assessment platform in medical schools and operating rooms across the country will enable an objective assessment of surgical proficiency, thus reducing training time and costs and lowering risk of medical error due to underdeveloped skills.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative, deep-learning Surgical Training and Assessment Platform to increase the commercial viability of a Virtual Reality (VR) surgical training program. VR surgical training technology holds enormous potential in improving the efficiency of learning by allowing for unlimited practice and rehearsal of surgical procedures; however, without the ability to reliably assess performance, such platforms cannot be used to their full potential. This application will translate the simulation environment into a vehicle for technical skills assessment to prevent trainees from graduating to independent practice without first proving competency in critical areas. The novel, proprietary software algorithms developed in this proposal will allow for the above applications and broad improvements to training efficiency and patient safety through the tracking and analysis of hand and head motion as a surrogate measure for surgical expertise. The Surgeon Assessment Platform will be developed by determining the most vital head and hand motion data to collect and validating the resulting assessment dataset in a small proof-of-concept study, while meeting the challenge of collecting, storing, and analyzing such a large, high-fidelity dataset.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

TEC at OSU has a track record in commercializing university technologies and training STEM and business students and is the primary market intelligence and business modeling entity, working with the Office of Research and the Technology Commercialization Office and partnering with more than a dozen colleges, department, research centers, and funded programs across campus. TEC has trained more than 500 graduate students and more than 40 research faculty using the Lean Startup curriculum, generating 27 new ventures that raised more than $40 million. TEC recently established a new initiative to support technology commercialization ? the Faculty Certification Program in Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization. This certification program uses an innovative pedagogy to train research faculty and their startup teams in the principles and techniques of commercialization via startup. 

The combined impact of the TEC Institute?s I-Corps@Ohio program and the new Faculty Certification Program is important for Central Ohio and across the state. The specific impact of the NSF I-Corps Sites funding is realized in:
1) An increase in the number of Ohio State teams that participate in the training program, 
2) A greater number of STEM graduate students that matriculate to entrepreneurial leads in technology startups, and 
3) More new technology startups that raise capital and launch in Ohio. 

Secondary outcomes that provide broad impacts are:
1) An increase in the number of inventions resulting from federally-funded research that are screened for commercial potential,
2) More new products and services providing innovative solutions to problems in healthcare, environmental sustainability, national security, food safety, etc., and 
3) Greater return on innovation investment for Ohio State. 

As successful ventures make their way to market, an additional outcome with big market impact is the number of research scientists that seek out training in advanced principles for commercialization because they recognize commercial markets on par with federal and state grants for career advancement and sustained funding for technology development."

"abstractText": "The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities.  (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

To leverage rapid technological development in sensing, imaging, and data analysis new ground breaking advances in neuroscience are necessary to facilitate knowledge discovery using data science methods. To address this societal grand challenge, the project will foster new interdisciplinary collaborations across computing, biological, mathematical, and behavioral science disciplines together with partnerships in academia, industry, and government at multiple levels. The Big Data Neuroscience Spoke titled Midwest: Advanced Computational Neuroscience Network (ACNN) is strongly aligned with the national priority area of neuroscience and brings together a diverse set of committed regional partners to enable the Midwest region to realize the promise of Big Data for neuroscience. The ACNN Spoke will build broad consensus on the core requirements, infrastructure, and components needed to develop a new generation of sustainable interdisciplinary Neuroscience Big Data research. ACNN will leverage the strengths and resources in the Midwest region to increase innovation and collaboration for the understanding of the structure, physiology, and function of the human brain through partnerships and services in education, tools, and best practices. 

The ACNN will design, pilot and support powerful neuroscientific computational resources for high-throughput, collaborative, and service-oriented data aggregation, processing and open-reproducible science. The ACNN Spoke framework will address three specific problems related to neuroscience Big Data: (1) data capture, organization, and management involving multiple centers and research groups, (2) quality assurance, preprocessing and analysis that incorporates contextual metadata, and (3) data communication to software and hardware computational resources that can scale with the volume, velocity, and variety of neuroscience datasets. The ACNN will build a sustainable ecosystem of neuroscience community partners in both academia and industry using existing technologies for collaboration and virtual meeting together with face-to-face group meetings. The planned activities of the ACNN Spoke will also allow the Midwest Big Data Hub to disseminate additional Big Data technologies resources to the neuroscience community, including access to supercomputing facilities, best practices, and platforms.

U.S. students will conduct research on a prosthetic device that was pioneered several decades ago at the Dr. P.K. Sethi Rehabilitation and Jaipur Limb Training Centre. It continues to be used throughout India due to the low-cost, cultural appropriateness, and magnitude of the amputee population. At present, the number of amputees in the world is significant, particularly in the developing countries. 

This IRES project will provide internships for five talented US-undergraduate engineering students each year over three years to conduct research and development activities that will provide a thorough understanding of this prosthetic device. At present, little is known about the properties of the individual components that comprise the device. The goal of this research is to improve the product for wider distribution within India and for eventual mass production so that it's potential for relieving the suffering of amputees in the developing world and beyond may be realized. 

Broader Description 
This project will make significant advances in prosthetic devices for the developing world. Although much is known in the U.S. regarding prosthetic devices, understanding the various design and production constraints for developing countries is less well-known. The project evaluation will lead to a better understanding of the impact of humanitarian projects on the development of engineering students. The research has the potential to transform the way that prosthetic devices are made in non-western regions in the world. 

The benefit to society accrued through this project is significant. Researchers will target women and underrepresented students for participation, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in engineering. This will serve to broaden participation in STEM fields. The results will be broadly disseminated through a variety of journals and conference venues. The impact on the world's poor who are amputees is potentially significant."

The goal of the Oklahoma State University (OSU) I-Corp Site is to increase the number of STEM-related startups and licensing opportunities emerging from the OSU campus. Recently, emphasis at this institution has been placed on the facilitation of business startups and tech transfer on campus resulting in an ecosystem that includes the School of Entrepreneurship, the Riata Center for Entrepreneurship, The Oklahoma State University Research Foundation, the New Product Development Lab, the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology's Fab Lab, and the Center for Sovereign Nation Engagement. The OSU I-Corp Site accelerates startup activity on campus not only by providing funding and training to startup teams, but also by helping create a faculty and student population that is familiar with the business startup process. It also provides a pathway for underrepresented students to participate in STEM-related business startups. 

The Site grant provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. 

The OSU I-Corp Site impact includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers. An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to provide an easily accessible and reliable national sewer data inventory that will assist municipal utility districts in developing effective and proactive maintenance and rehabilitation plans, hence reducing the overall maintenance costs of sewer systems as well as avoiding costly repairs due to pipe failures. Moreover, if the technology is successfully commercialized, sewer officials such as National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) will better understand the current and trend of sewer systems condition nation-wide; as such, they will have proven justification to secure adequate federal funding for sewer system improvements. This technology will support the nation's agenda of improving the condition of the aging and deteriorating sewer infrastructure, which will promote societal wellbeing and support the sustainable development of the society. In addition, it has been expected that the availability of national sewer inventory will help the industry to find new uses of sewer data and new collaborations. The participation in the NSF I-Corps program affords graduate students a great opportunity to cultivate their skills in innovation and entrepreneurship, which may lead to the creation of start-up companies and more job opportunities.

This I-Corps project addresses common concerns -- data availability and data quality -- raised by sewer industry stakeholders. Understanding the current condition and deterioration mechanism of sewer pipe networks is a critical step in improving national wastewater systems, which requires easily accessible and reliable data. Although sewer inspection data have been collected by various utility districts across the country for many years, the data is not in a usable and uniform format for asset management purposes. This technology provides a visual tool to evaluate and report data quality issues and an innovative algorithm to resolve these issues. The preliminary results show that, by applying the proposed quality assurance algorithm to six datasets obtained by the team, the percentage of good quality inspection data increased from 50%-75% (pre-process) to 95% (post-process). More importantly, the proposed technology includes a comprehensive, uniform, and quality-assured national sewer inventory that documents the historical and current conditions of sewer pipelines. Through the regional NSF I-Corps site program, it was concluded that there is a tremendous need for the proposed technology among utilities and contractors because of the time and cost savings that can be realized in inspection processes and rehabilitation plans.

This I-Corps project investigates the commercial potential of the technology, which leads users through a series of interactive, instructional videos that help users become critical readers of how language is used in discipline-specific, research writing in order to become better research writers. Users integrate their new knowledge of language use into practice tools derived from the field of applied linguistics. These tools help users analyze and discover language use patterns that are used to effectively structure a scientific argument. Automated feedback then guides users toward more purposeful analysis of writing. Studies have demonstrated that these tools can heighten user?s awareness of how to construct an original research argument while increasing their self-efficacy in becoming successful published research writers.  Furthermore, the tools have helped users become more independent writers, requiring users to seek less guidance about writing from research mentors who need the extra time to focus on their own research agendas.

Millions of individuals work in office and administrative support occupations. Most of these individuals spend majority of their working time sitting. With prolonged sitting there is immobility in the lower extremities which could result in venous blood flow issues and in some cases pulmonary embolism.  The innovation is a seating solution with a seat that is split so there are two parts on the bottom that could move separately by pushing down on a lever and individuals could move their legs up and down.

Patient medical information comes in many forms: DNA sequences, medical images, clinical observations, etc. Integration of these various data sources across large patient populations can reveal novel insights into clinical disease and inform new treatment options. There is a growing need for scalable data integration to support the delivery of precision medicine. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on the data Framework that was created during Phase I work. This Framework supports the aggregation of different types of medical data into a single data core ?pool?, and computation on the pooled data in a scalable cloud environment. The Framework includes a custom database for genomic sequencing data. During Phase II of this project, this custom (sparse matrix) approach to data storage will be adapted to handle microscopy images of cancer and other diseased tissues. The Framework, with its integrated genomic and image databases, will be marketed to healthcare systems, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical companies interested in applying advanced analytics on large, complex datasets.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers."

The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

"abstractText": "This STTR Phase I project aims to pioneer a novel approach for the sustained delivery of peptide therapeutics using nano-composite microparticles. Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.

Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology."

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This I-Corps Site project helps OSU deliver on its mission as a land grant university and advance efforts to revitalize an economically depressed Oregon by helping multiple local teams transition their ideas to the marketplace. Funds allow OSUAA to make specific enhancements to the Accelerator and increase the number of I-Corps Site (ICS) teams. The project's three goals include the following: (1) Enhancing linkages with the OSU engineering, science, and business disciplines through a faculty liaison program in support of Accelerator ICS teams; (2) Creating and delivering new course content on personal development, team formation, and dynamics to enable high performing ICS teams; and (3) Providing course materials and tracking software to enhance the Lean Canvas curriculum delivery and seed funds for development of prototypes and minimum viable products.

Many of the emerging companies OSUAA supports help address larger societal issues  such as clean energy and expensive healthcare devices. OSUAA provides a supportive environment to allow these cutting-edge technologies to develop and find commercialization pathways. Ultimately, the OSUAA may serve as a viable model to help develop new business and enhanced employment outcomes for other rural land grant institutions engaged in similar research activities.  

The OSUAA framework to advance the commercialization of research will help improve the economic climate and development in the largely rural state of Oregon. Oregon, particularly in the rural areas, tends to lag the nation in economic prosperity and recovery. Through facilitated launch of new startup companies, the OSU system may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development, manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components and dedicated resources for prototyping. 

OSUAA works across all 11 university colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world, experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works closely with the four cultural centers on campus to ensure that traditionally underrepresented groups know about, have access to, and take advantage of OSUAA's learning opportunities."

With this technology pharmaceutical companies can automatically and rapidly screen thousands of compounds with non-technically trained staff in multiple animal models.

This I-Corps project advances vision screening. The technology is analogous to a customizable disco ball, that can automatically alter light displays to non-invasively assess multiple aspects of vision in seeing verbal and nonverbal animals. Our past research has proven the technology is well-matched to screen multiple aspects of vision within 20s in zebrafish, an important biomedical model. It is a platform technology, therefore the invention will be important for high throughput screening of pharmaceutical compounds, biological mutants, and toxicological agents in diverse biomedical models, thereby advancing drug discovery, gene therapies, and quality control and assurance.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will directly affect the treatment and management of the over 80 km3 of wastewater and solid wastes produced each year in the US. Waste treatment processes are directly tied to environmental and human health in both developed and developing countries but are subject to high costs due to significant energy and maintenance requirements. Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure. Potential markets for this technology include public, municipal facilities in addition to treatment facilities in the industrial/agricultural sector.  Development of the proposed technology will likely spur additional applications of AI systems in other fields centered around microbial community based engineered systems like bioproduct production, biosensing, and bioremediation.

This I-Corps project is based on our recent development of a machine learning based approach used to accurately predict microbial community structure, process stability, and reactor performance for wastewater treatment. This novel approach, which incorporates genomic data along with environmental and operational parameters into data-mining datasets has demonstrated significant increases in accurately predicting process stability and performance of small-scale wastewater systems compared to models developed without consideration of microbial community dynamics. The predictive models developed through the construction of artificial neural networks have potential to inform engineering decisions for optimized performance and stability of environmental biotechnologies in full-scale systems. Development and implementation of this approach will not only progress the understanding and control of microbial communities that inhabit environmental biotechnologies but may be expanded to other microbiomes such as those associated with human health and biogeochemical cycles.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the
development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical
outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual
number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the
national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion
procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk
patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in
chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent
disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians
and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a
cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure
(BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new
surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing
complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic
surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to
accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,
face, and long bones.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to
demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates
new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to
clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal
instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of
the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the
fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws
accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such
as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to
create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased
under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized
electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key
regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational
evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic
instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of
electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and
improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions
utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model."

Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

Plasma activated water has several advantages: it is reusable and reduces the need to buy, store, and dispose of chemicals, it will not face antimicrobial resistance, unlike chemicals, and could be a faster disinfectant. In addition to replacing chemical disinfectants, plasma activated water could prove to be fast enough to allow for disinfecting the milking unit in-between individual cows, which should reduce the spread of mastitis within a herd, reducing the farmer's costs in terms of medicine, increased labor, and culling. By using plasma activated water as part of a milking system, cleaning could be automated as well as target spores in farm environments. The resulting reduction in costs, infection rate, manual labor & strain, and increase in milk quality, could revolutionize the dairy industry.

This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to research a method whereby plasma activated water replaces chemical disinfectants used in dairy milking machines. The dairy industry is facing two major problems relating to milking machines: first, a manual labor shortage, and secondly an ever-present threat of mastitis, an infection estimated to cost the industry $1B annually. These two problems come to a head at the milking machine, as current methods require cows to be manually cleaned before milking. The goal of this project is to explore whether plasma activated water could be an effective replacement for teat dips, aiming to design a self-cleaning milking attachment for existing machines, and clean the cows with PAW prior to milking. In Phase I, the focus will be on building a basic prototype to check sanitation capabilities, and compatibility with a farm environment.

This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will be significantly improved with the installation of passive radiative composite (PRC) roofing material for building energy management. The market demand for cool roofing materials has exceeded $1 Billion, annually, and is expected to grow with increasing need and return on investment. PRC roofing material can expect to compete in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal management to a variety of cooling needs including refrigerated transportation and storage. The development of PRC roofing will advance understanding and use of spectrally-selective materials designed for intelligent control of thermal radiation. 

The proposed project will provide critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage, relative to current commercial cool roofing materials, is expected to create significant long-term cost savings and reduction in fossil fuel usage for climate controlled structures. PRC material properties designed to be spectrally selective offer the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of solar and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly in the 8-13 micron atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, durability, and large batch manufacturing economy. Demonstration of PRC-based roofing materials on full-scale test structures will quantify passive cooling power and robustness to weathering, positioning PRC-based roofing for introduction by a commercial manufacturing partner.

While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation, has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free, continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing. Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem, as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination in continuous fermenters. The final objective is to fine-tune the biocide/biocide-resistant system to demonstrate the technology will not adversely affect the production yield and product quality in continuous fermenters. If successful, future Phase II development will be conducted in pilot and industrial-scale reactors to further optimize the technology.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally.

The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations. The challenge that comes with this  is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good reliability . This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit people with hand amputations. Touch feedback is a critical component of human manipulation, and its loss is most poignant in people with hand amputations. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide control through touch sensory feedback. Without touch feedback, prosthetic users tend to avoid manipulating many objects they otherwise could because they run the risk of destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research will yield a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million people with hand amputations worldwide and improve their quality of life.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the sockets of hand prosthetics to give users useful sensory feedback. The stimulator will integrate with existing prosthetic control systems. It will be built using standard off-the-shelf components, have a form factor small enough to easily fit into a variety of different prosthetic sockets, and operate for at least 12 hours while operating alongside a prosthetic hand and its control system. To improve sensation quality, a sensation controller that enables consistent long-term stimulation will be deployed, reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The expected outcomes of this research are 1) a portable, cost effective and energy efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the socket of a prosthetic user and integrated with their prosthetic hand; and 2) a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for daily manipulation tasks. The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the replacement of key petroleum-based chemicals used in the paints and coatings industry, representing a $7B industry that is growing at 7% per year. The total addressable market includes 3 similar diols: 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO). In this project, 1,5-PDO is produced from furfural, a chemical made from renewable agricultural residues such as corn cobs and wood chips.  Bio-based 1,5-PDO can be readily substituted for 1,6-HDO in many applications due to its analogous molecular structure and is similar enough to 1,4-BDO that it can be substituted for it in some applications. Rigorous technoeconomic analysis shows that this "green" 1,5-PDO can be made at 3x lower costs than oil-derived 1,5-PDO, opening new opportunities for its use as a renewable monomer for paints, coatings, adhesives and plastics.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will allow the technology to be developed with commercially available fixed bed pellet catalysts to prepare the technology for scale-up.  Thus far, the technology has been demonstrated in small scale fixed bed reactors with powder catalysts.  A commercial scale process requires the use of pelletized catalysts due to inoperable pressure drops over powder catalysts in commercial-scale reactors. The higher flowrates inherent with larger scale reactors cannot flow through the tightly packed powder catalysts and cause a large degree of backpressure upstream of the catalyst bed; thus, pelletized catalysts must be sourced from commercial vendors and tested for activity and stability prior to scaling.  The next phase in technology development is to scale up the process by >100x, enabling testing and validation of larger amounts of the bio-based 1,5-PDO product in potential customers' product lines.  This SBIR Phase I project will also allow completion of the process design work needed to estimate the economics at commercial scale.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance precision medicine by reducing data processing time and cost, leading to faster results, higher genomic data processing throughput and, ultimately leading to better treatment of patients. Many diseases have their impacts locked in DNA data. Unlocking the data for an individual may provide a significant boost to human healthcare. By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today's cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women. Correct prediction and treatment based on WGS data will extend human lives and promote better quality of life by accelerating the development and broad implementation of precision medicine.

The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to develop a cloud-based framework to accelerate whole genome sequencing data analysis.  This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques. The framework under development for accelerating genomic analysis has been implemented to focus on GPUs and traditional processors (CPUs). Using this framework, secondary data analysis programs can use all the computing resources present in a standard computing node (CPU cores; GPUs), leading to higher utilization of the system and higher throughput. The GPU accelerates the data parallel portion of the software, while the CPU is mainly responsible for the orchestration of data between CPUs and GPUs, load balancing across multiple accelerators. By providing this framework to run on the cloud and on-premise, users can scale to meet the exploding demands of the DNA analysis industry. The software generates exact results to industry standard tools and does not sacrifice configurability that is critical for users. This framework also will enable researchers and medical professionals to analyze several thousands of genomes simultaneously, leading to higher quality results.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care.  As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences.  Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere.  When they do, providers lose margin.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences.  Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details.  The company's software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences.  Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers.  This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share?  Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Penn State I-Corps Site, operated under the umbrella of the Invent Penn State Initiative and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, supports the translation of university research, develops partnerships between the university and regional economic development organizations and the national I-Corps Network, and trains students to be the drivers of research commercialization.

The Penn State I-Corps Site teams that pursue commercialization through two different programs, the TechCelerator@State College and the Happy Valley LaunchBox. These two programs are structured to nurture innovator teams using Lean Startup methodology and embody the notion of nurturing innovators both with deep craft and fresh eyes, that is, people with some who have depth of technical expertise as well as those with a fresh perspective on new markets, communication technologies, and consumer concepts. The TechCelerator Program, established in 2011 seeks to accelerate the commercialization of University technology. The Happy Valley Launchbox, created in 2015, is a community-university accelerator that makes extensive use of Lean Startup principles and Design Thinking to help teams bring their ideas into the marketplace. The I-Corps Site program provides funds to teams that are either selected out of one of these programs or have members combined from both programs to support the translation of university technology. The I-Corps Site also engages the broad network of Penn State Innovation hubs across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

The outcomes of this project have the potential for significant broader impacts across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the region. Initial activity focuses on Penn State's main University Park Campus. However, Invent Penn State operates 13 community innovation hubs throughout the State, affiliated with the University's network of Commonwealth campuses. In addition, the Penn State I-Corps Site, in collaboration with the Upstate New York regional I-Corps Node will run summer programs to train leaders from the commonwealth innovation hubs in Lean startup methodology and will engage their promising teams with the Upstate New York (UNY) regional I-Corps Node."

"abstractText": "Fulfilling the promise of "Big Data" for fields, such as migration studies, climate science, and food security systems, requires accurate and timely data from countries across the globe. Data collected through Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies, such as remote sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have the potential to contribute to global data hubs. However, most IoT applications and their data structures are designed to solve local problems, such as crop protection and local food shortage predictions. This IRES SITTE project will train 18 U.S. master's students in multicriteria design of and policies for IoT systems with the aim of making local IoT data available to global data scientists. 

The project involves collaborations with professors/mentors at University of Rwanda and Carnegie Mellon Africa, both in Kigali, Rwanda, the former of which serves as the Center of Excellence for IoT under the World Bank's Eastern and Southern Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program. Through the collaboration, students will receive interdisciplinary research training in wireless networks, software engineering, policy studies and sociotechnical systems. This interdisciplinary training will enable designs of low cost IoT systems, usable in a range of contexts, including the U.S., while increasing access to data by biology/agriculture and forced migration scientists. The training will also enhance students' as well as the project's advisory board, consisting of academic scientists and an industry innovation professional, on information and communication technology (ICT) innovations systems in East Africa, expanding global perspectives within the U.S. IT workforce.

Fulfilling the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ongoing systems innovation to incorporate advances in foundational technologies, lower costs, and fulfill the needs of global data scientists. Designing systems for integration of sensor-derived local data into global scientific data platforms, such as the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) hub and the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Migration Data Portal, can simultaneously inform local, regional and global challenges of socioeconomic and environmental development. 
This IRES Site Program pursues novel IoT research. The interdisciplinary research combines complementary wireless network, software engineering, policy studies, and sociotechnical systems expertise of the three mentors and the PI.  The program consists of three projects, two technical and one focused on policy analysis. 

The first technical project involves unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones) designed for collecting data from refugee gardens. Using cameras, the UAVs collect image data processed through a Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), a standard approach for vegetation monitoring. The UAV will also be controlled by software to optimize its path-planning, enhancing both coverage i.e. canvassing the target area, and network connectivity.  The second technical project targets device-to-device communications (D2D) for systems without access to a power grid, through innovations in hardware, software and data management systems, designed to improve crop information on tea estates.  A third project focuses on IoT policy analyses at national and organizational levels. The analyses will highlight current trends in Rwandan IoT use, system vulnerabilities, as well as national and organizational policies that may affect data sharing practices and hinder access by Big Data scientists.

This IRES Site Program develops interdisciplinary and creative information technology professionals capable of solving multi-criteria design problems. Through intellectually challenging yet appropriately scoped projects, master's students are exposed to international innovation systems and gain insights into the culture of East Africa. The program's design includes both pre-departure and follow-on courses, insuring effective student preparation and widespread dissemination of results.

For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools."

Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology."

By providing a system for autonomous vehicles to understand the goals and behaviors of humans on the road, the technology will allow autonomous vehicles to react to humans safely and effectively. Without the innovations commercialized with the help of this award, autonomous vehicles will be at best uselessly timid and dangerous additions to urban roads, and at worst a deadly obstacle to the goal of safe, livable cities.  Every autonomous vehicle that is capable enough to be on the market will need to solve the problem that this project is helping to solve.
 
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will help to address one of the thorniest problems in autonomous vehicles. The question of how a computer system can gain an understanding of human mental states has occupied researchers and laypeople with an interest in machine intelligence since the coining of the term.  By building an approach based on the leveraging of careful human measurement and state-of-the-art learning algorithms, the innovations developed in this project will help pave a new path towards the computational modeling of cognitive facilities that are central to human intelligence but historically intractable to model using conventional machine learning or computer vision techniques.  In addition to helping solve the central problem of human understanding for autonomous vehicles, the research published from this project will open new avenues for understanding a broad class of problems where the question of "ground truth" about the world is difficult or impossible to answer."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project aims to create and test a game-based intelligent tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has shown that early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible, and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded instruction. 


This project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented. However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate, leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot.
Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges
include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling. The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  

The miniaturization of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited, yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers. As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication, and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the prototype."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
(UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular
detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still
remains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report
from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5
million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-
Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by
more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting
in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,
makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market
accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of
generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will
benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early
treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a
significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.

The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence
signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-
Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally
efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional
excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher
compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive
detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to
achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less
than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser
sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to
fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to
develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for
Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma
(IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be
adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,
HIV and Cancer.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data."

Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications."

transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,
can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean
transportation and clean energy.

jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to

The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies."

These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.

This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.

It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden annually, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Such a tool would ideally gather any relevant information very quickly and provide a probability of sepsis directly back to the physician in less than 30 minutes. If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool.

The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction. The result of this project will be a fully functional reader and accompanying disposable cartridges for the measurement of these critical sepsis biomarkers.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform."

"abstractText": "This research project will develop a collaborative data science platform for computational social science called the Data Science Foundry. The collection and management of large-scale data currently is a relatively unstructured process, with data-processing decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Society has started to rely on data-driven science to address policy-related questions, however. The development of a collaborative platform that provides structure will allow social scientists to collaborate and validate each other's studies.  This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

This information is critical to the development of drug pipeline contributing to a $190 BN biologic's market where $87BN in first generation biologics face patent expiration before 2020. A successful technical approach for its implementation will provide essential information for decision making towards which candidates will enter the market, thus increasing the Biopharma valuation and ensuring supply of drugs to patients. In the end, improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases.

The proposed project will address the need for a multivariate high-throughput technology to address the risk of protein aggregation, that when adopted in R&D, will increase pipeline approvals, reduce late stage withdrawals and total costs of drug development. Average R&D development costs for the mere 1% of candidates reaching FDA approval have risen to $2.6 BN per product. Protein therapeutic development needs to be guided by a full understanding of protein stability and aggregation. 
Research objectives are to: develop our innovative First-in-Class high throughput platform for screening protein therapeutics; develop original software capable of deciphering protein aggregation mechanism, size, identity and extent of aggregated protein and product stability; commercialize the innovative technology platform. Fully automated evaluation of protein candidates during early R&D phase will be conducted. Best-in-class image acquisition technology will be employed towards this end, using a label free chemical mapping technology, dedicated software using auto recognition algorithms, and correlations to decipher protein aggregation. We through the use of its breakthrough technology will determine: the aggregate free candidate under various stressor conditions, optimum formulation conditions for the protein therapeutic, the most stable candidate, and electronic data reporting that establishes accuracy, reproducibility, critical quality attributes of the protein product."

Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.

This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable a consumer device for the detection of infectious pathogens at the point-of-need instead of in a central laboratory environment. The project will enhance current approaches to disease detection and monitoring in remote and low-resource settings by rapid and sensitive detection of infectious agents and automated data-logging. The commercial impact of the detection system leverages current smartphone capability in concert with advances in imaging, microfluidics, and enhanced computation to deliver detection of multiple important human pathogens all within a portable format.  Further, widespread user experience with smartphone technologies mitigates the need for additional training steps and lowers barriers to adoption. This project will support extensive customer discovery with field workers, healthcare community workers, clinicians, nurses, and procurement officials within governmental and aid organizations. 

This I-Corps project integrates the smartphone with external hardware and disposable microfluidic chips to enable a portable pathogen detection platform. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the sensitivity of pathogen detection. In the presence of pathogens, DNA amplification occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system. A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing both detection results and immediately logging the data. Data can be readily pushed to the cloud where organizations can track detection events in real-time. Therefore, this I-Corps project will explore the market potential for smartphone-based pathogen detection in remote and low-resource settings and for applications where disease surveillance and monitoring is of great utility. To this end, this project will provide fast and affordable infectious pathogen detection solutions while aiding in effective healthcare resource distribution.

One specific commercial application is synthesis of anti-corrosive coatings on variety of substrate materials. Owing to the unique intrinsic properties of graphene, the system enables lower coating cost and faster synthesis times. These protective coatings are utilized in multiple industries including aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas. This project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology and will inform further technical developments and possible commercialization paths and will create new research and commercialization thrusts in the overall field of plasma nanoscience.

This I-Corps project is focused on advancing the innovative approach of Radio Frequency plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique for synthesis the large quantities of graphene coatings on various substrate materials. Recent research advances indicate that graphene can be effectively generated in the plasma discharge environment. Plasma CVD synthesis has been shown to be effective in the production of monolayer and several-layer sheets of crystalline films of graphene characterized by high quality and low structural defects. In addition, utilization of plasma flux at synthesis enhances mobility and reactivity of the species participating in the synthesis process on the substrate's surface in comparison with that when atomic flux is used.  This enables synthesis at lower temperatures and widens range of substrate materials that can be used in the synthesis.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock, as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.   However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption; 3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated CO2."

QC technology is expected to disrupt significant portions of the high-performance computing environment for optimization problems, which has previously been characterized by slow and incremental performance improvements. This project would yield a platform that both increases the efficiency and lowers the cost of analyzing complex optimization problems, which could spur fast-paced innovation in wide areas of the economy that tackle such issues. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the need for a cloud-based platform for using QC technology. Early-generation quantum computers have been introduced by multiple hardware vendors. Despite advances in performance of QC processors, little effort has been directed toward developing programming environments and applications that can provide simple and inexpensive access to QC capabilities and that can exploit the power that QC systems will have in the near future. This project will develop a suite of front-end and back-end tools that efficiently transform high-level computing problems into formulations for circuit-model QC systems, abstracting away the physical low-level details and domain knowledge currently necessary to build QC applications. The project will further develop a set of applications in optimization, search, and machine learning. The proposed research will explore the best software tools and platform methods for integrating emerging QC capabilities into enterprise and research workflows by streamlining and making affordable the decomposition and formulation of real-world problems into implementations that run on quantum processors.

"abstractText": "The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable a much wider adoption of various photomedical treatments.  Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.

The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.

Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology."

The image quality of the high-energy, X-ray grating-based interferometry imaging system will be advantageous for detecting critical size flaws 
on flight critical aerospace components, such as turbine components, and medical devices such as customized hip cups. Interferometry radiography is capable of detection of sub-micron to micron voids at a rate faster than conventional industrial X-ray CT scanning. Imaging speed and quality is important; some flight critical components face a reject rate of 10% based on the current X-ray CT scans.  The goal of better image quality is feedback into the additive manufacturing print parameters so as to increase part yield and reliability. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the first to commercialize high-energy, X-ray grating interferometry in the US.  The interferometry concepts for this proposal are novel and have been partly derived from the NSF-supported gravity wave detection facility, the Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which led to a hardware/software patent for high-energy X-ray grating optics and software. The microfabricated gold and/or nickel structures on silicon or graphite wafers have exceedingly high aspect ratios, requiring the use of support structures for physical stability of the microfabricated features.  The support structures introduce image noise and diminished interferometry performance.

Today large scale solar generation (the majority of all solar energy) is almost exclusively by large farms of photovoltaic (PV) panels made from silicon cells, as used also for rooftop solar. The research is aimed at enhancing scientific and technological understanding of an alternative approach that exploits a different, much more efficient type of PV cell.? It promises lower cost electricity in sunny climates around the world, from longer lived plants using less land. The potential societal impact is broader adoption of solar electricity both in the US and across the world, and thus reduced global pollution. The commercial impact of the project is also huge. In the targeted global market, $30 billion now is spent annually on new solar installations and an increase to $100 billion is projected. This is an opportunity for the US to re-establish itself as a world leader in solar manufacturing, of both the different PV cells that underlie our approach, and the optical and mechanical systems that are the target of this research and are key to cost reduction.?

The proposed project will explore a new approach to solar electricity generation, using advanced photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity with twice the efficiency of silicon PV panels. The innovation is in the system used to focus sunlight on the cells as needed?for highest efficiency at lowest cost. The advanced PV cells themselves have already been developed for spacecraft, but previous efforts to commercialize them for ground use have failed, because the systems needed to provide concentrated sunlight were too expensive. The research will be directed to developing, building and testing the two innovative elements critical to a complete, low cost system: 1) Small glass lens arrays used at the focus of large dish reflectors to apportion sunlight equally onto individual small cells. Existing commercial glass molding methods do not yield arrays of the size and precision needed; a new molding method tailored specifically for the task will be developed. 2) A novel mechanical structure will be developed to orient the mirrors toward the sun throughout the day with minimal use of steel, by employing an efficient spaceframe structure turning on a ground track, and a sensor-feedback system to eliminate conventional, heavy, rigid bearings.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase 1 project will study how communications feedback loops effect online learning, especially in group settings. The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.


This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events. It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. 

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate, and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment to be realized by using this platform.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the most critical problems facing the United States agricultural industry, a shortage of available labor.   This shortage has had a particularly pronounced effect on the fruit and vegetable industry, where even a brief loss of labor can result in a total loss of harvestable products.  More recently, U.S. produce suppliers have been forced to rely heavily on imported produce sourced from greater distances and of lower quality.  Advancements in agricultural technology have already dramatically improved the efficiency of produce farms in terms of land utilization and water consumption by enabling produce to be grown indoors using highly sophisticated commercial greenhouses, automated nutrient delivery, and light control.  However, to date, these commercial greenhouses still lack a comprehensive solution for automating routine harvesting, pruning, and crop care labor tasks.  Thus, newly developed agricultural technologies which can automate these tasks have the potential for substantial commercial impact by making domestic farming operations more profitable and efficient.  Commercial adoption of automated harvesting technology will also benefit consumers by enabling higher quality produce grown closer to market and position the U.S. agricultural sector as a new area of growth for highly skilled technical jobs.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of new deep learning techniques used to identify harvestable fruits (initially tomatoes) using computer vision cameras and to accurately estimate their orientation and connectivity (bunches of fruits that are connected by the same stem or vine).  Successful development of a method capable of running in real-time would resolve substantial technical risks which inhibit the ability to commercialize robotic automated harvesting solutions.  Such advancements would also contribute newfound insights to the broader computer vision and robotic manipulation communities into the unique challenges that sparse and deformable ?vine? like structures present to traditional methods of object pose estimation and grasping.  In the later portion of this Phase I project, Root AI will incorporate these new methods of sensing tomato fruit orientation into an improved motion and task planning system which uses the additional information to intelligently plan a complex movement path to harvest individual fruits in congested and heavily occluded natural growing environments.

While each orphan disease affects a small fraction of individuals, thousands exist, affecting 400 million people world-wide. The challenge to bring therapies to the clinics for diseases that currently have no cure, which is coupled with an expanding market.  Orphan drug sales are expected to reach $262 billion in 2024.  Over the last few years, organoids made from human embryonic stem cells have raised the possibility of understanding the mechanisms leading to a genetic disorder by reconstituting, in vitro, a similar arrangement of the specific cell populations that are implicated in a certain disease. By comparing organoids made from healthy cells to those carrying the associated genetic mutation, drug testing may be performed in vitro to discover new therapeutics. However, this potential has not been harnessed due to technical limitations. In this proposal, as a necessary step towards this goal, the plan is to develop the analytical tools based on machine learning algorithms that will allow the analysis of drug therapeutic potential and toxicity when applied to organoid cultures.

The intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project is to develop and validate an unbiased analytical scheme to quantify the results of high-throughput phenotypic screens performed on micropattern organoids. Organoids have the potential to revolutionize the pre-clinical part of the drug discovery pipeline as they provide unbiased endpoints, they are disease relevant, and sensitive to toxicity. However, the use of multi-cellular organization in a high-throughput platform requires analysis of large amounts of information-rich microscopy images. The tools developed in this proposal will allow turning the biological complexity of tissue scale phenotypes into information predictive of the clinical potential of a compound. In the first aim, the goal is to demonstrate that the proposed method allows quantifying compound toxicity. The plan is to calibrate the toolbox against known methods quantifying cell viability, applying known toxic agents and withdrawn drugs. This will constitute a stringent test for the efficiency of the proposed method at quantifying deleterious effects of a compound. Second, the goal is to optimize the algorithm to measure therapeutic potential, using positive controls on micropattern-based organoids modeling Huntington's Disease (HD). The objective is to demonstrate the ability to analyze results of a screening campaign aimed at phenotypic reversal on the HD organoids, and detect hit molecules from a small library of FDA-approved drugs.

This project addresses major barriers in our main market, the application of IoT to the buildings sector, where complexity is encountered in the placement and powering of sensors in monitoring locations where access is limited. By reducing the upfront and maintenance costs of wireless sensor networks, the project allows cost-effective building sensor data collection of unprecedented longevity and density. These rich data sets in turn enable myriad benefits, including more effective building management controls and in-depth automated energy evaluations. The commercial availability of a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor would enable high-granularity sensing, feedback, and control to several additional markets including industrial, agricultural, and any other market application that would benefit from monitoring where power or access is in short supply. 

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on developing a low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental monitor using commercially available components and standard processes. An energy harvesting sensor of this type is not available commercially, and is uniquely enabling for building energy auditing and controls, supporting a new generation of automation and systems integration while eliminating the cost of extensive powered sensor installation or battery maintenance. This device was developed through Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 in Phase 1 of the SBIR program, in parallel with supporting data infrastructure, including dynamic cloud databases, data access via API methods and a beta data visualization platform. Phase II of the program aims to expand the scope of the low-cost, wireless, energy-harvesting environmental sensor from a network of low-power, short-range devices to a plug-and-play building-wide sensing solution, which includes the incorporation of additional hardware elements, including routers to extend the range of the low-power devices, and the development of automated data analysis strategies to extract valuable building information for the end-user."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project is developing a breakthrough technology to non-invasively monitor fetal oxygen levels in utero, to enable the more accurately detection of fetuses in distress and facilitate safer births for mothers and babies. Currently, obstetricians struggle with a 50-year old monitoring technology, which reports fetal heart rate and maternal contractions, and that is associated with an 89% false positive rate for detecting babies in distress. This is a major contributor to high cesarean section rates worldwide and up to 40% in some US hospitals. Because of the costs, risks for mothers and negative implications for babies' health, C-section rates are coming under scrutiny from insurers and accreditors, however, clinicians lack the means to accurately identify oxygenation starvation and, to date, no non-invasive means of directly measuring fetal oxygenation has been developed. Raydiant's system builds off traditional pulse oximetry and will employ safe levels of light, through the mother's abdomen, to monitor fetal pulse and report oxygen saturation, the crucial, but missing diagnostic. This technology will be applicable to over 2.9 million births per year in the US as an enhancement to traditional monitoring whenever a heart rate signal of concern is observed. Both the absolute oxygenation value and its trend over time will enable more informed decision making throughout the birth process.

This project pushes the fundamental boundaries of pulse oximetry and bio-photonics. Unlike traditional finger pulse oximetry, sensing non-invasively through the maternal abdomen presents a body in a body problem, where the fetal pulse signal is orders of magnitude weaker than and intertwined with the maternal. Photons are scattered and absorbed by multiple tissue layers and there are tradeoffs between signal strength, noise and the ratio of fetal to maternal signal. Non-homogeneities from subject to subject makes calibration difficult. Addressing these challenges will require innovation in photonics hardware and signal processing and this proposal has a three specific aims: the development of a specific sensor hardware architecture that will facilitate detection of the fetal signal; development of Raydiant's algorithm to separate fetal from maternal signal, reject noise and report saturation; and validation of the combined system in a pregnant animal model, where fetal oxygenation levels are actively controlled and compared to the device reading. This proposal encompasses developing a second generation prototype system and represents critical technology de-risking aiming towards a commercial system for integration with current monitoring technology and clinical practice.

Using Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) to develop a next-generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), increasing performance while reducing energy consumption at the sensor node level, is possible. As already experienced in our data driven world, it is critical that we improve our computing capabilities at the edge in order to gain in responsiveness and increase our energy efficiency. With evermore data and performance requirements to deliver on the consumer demands, innovative uses of emerging memories are showing great promise and providing capabilities that will help fulfill the IoT's potential. If fulfilled, this technology has the potential to enable a whole set of data driven applications at the edge, such as low-energy image recognition and learning in drones to operate longer and more effectively or long-lasting medical implants with leading data aggregation and reactiveness.

This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will aim to commercialize a patented technology to realize a ultra-low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based on Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM). To handle the data explosion in Internet of Things (IoT) network, the industry is moving towards increasing intelligent analysis capability for single IoT devices. Tight power budget has become a critical road block: high-end solutions, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, can provide enough computing capability but fail to meet the power budget, while low-power commercial products, such as micro-controllers and low-power FPGAs, can satisfy power constraints but hardly follow the increasing complexity in data analysis algorithms. This project aims to develop a ultra-low-power FPGA that can offer high-performance data analysis capability under IoT-level power limits. This project will prototype a FPGA chip built around an innovative RRAM-based routing multiplexer design. We will also release an associated software tool suite to support the implementation of customer's applications on the technology. Compared to existing commercial solutions, the proposed FPGA product is expected to demonstrate similar computing capability as high-end FPGA solutions while satisfying an IoT power budget (<1W).

This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness."

This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features.

This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube."

The race for the perfect battery is intensifying due to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density, reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic tool that provides an unprecedented glimpse inside the battery and has the potential to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities while a new revenue stream making batteries more sustainable.  Ultimately, this reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener use of resources for society. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.

Within RPI, the Center for Automated Technology has rapid prototyping capabilities. The Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies has resources for biotechnology and medicine innovators. And, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software is a leader for testing and developing software projects. 

RPI's I-Corps Site enables increased formalization and acceleration of existing programs with a focus on supporting student teams directly. Student teams are funded with modest amounts for software for collaboration and instruction, infrastructure, transportation and building an MVP to enable teams to transition into commercialization or an I-Corps national Team applicant. The mentors, expert advice, and networking opportunities are provided by the Accelerate518 schools for all teams. The I-Corps Site experience directly supports the development of formal, active, local innovation ecosystems for faculty and staff that contribute to broader national innovation ecosystem, increasing the interest in innovation and commercialization as well as increased numbers of educated students in the lean startup systems and processes of entrepreneurship.

The RPI region is experiencing growth in a number of high technology areas with Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties becoming centers for technology companies and knowledge workers. Further strengthening a culture supporting entrepreneurship in the region could have a meaningful economic impact and encourage both graduates and recently formed companies to stay in the region."

This challenge is a socio-technical, collective action problem that can be addressed through a combination of tools and incentives. The project proposes to holding a series of workshops along with proofs-of-concept implementations. These workshops will result in approaches to decentralize the sharing of data in the long tail, through socio-technical approaches that appropriately incentivize and facilitate data integration by smaller labs. Such an interdisciplinary community will provide crucial real-world input to computer science researchers, which will give their research into tools the potential for larger impact in ecological practice and will yield better tools for ecologists.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a coating product with superior durability and antifouling performance in the targeted environmental-friendly marine coating market. This innovative solution requires a less frequent application and reduces the amount of subaquatic growth on the hull of ships and static objects in bodies of water. Potential economic benefits include improving fuel efficiency and saving the maintenance cost of ships and static marine structures. At the same time, this product provides enormous environmental benefits by reducing the greenhouse gas emission from cargo ships and avoiding the potential species invasion caused by current marine coatings. In particular, this product is the first non-biocide environmentally friendly product of its kind. It addresses the current and future needs highlighted by global regulations to replace the existing harmful biocide-leaching coatings with an eco-friendly solution.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a novel marine coating product to deliver a high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution that is currently lacking in the marketplace. Current self-polishing coating products were subject to increasing regulatory restriction, while alternative environmental-friendly option such as fouling-release coating suffered low antifouling performance. This novel coating technology potentially achieves the durability and high antifouling performance for targeted marine applications, and the eco-friendly feature without leaching biocide into the aqueous environment. The objective of this project is to explore the key fabrication factors in coating formulation and identify their impacts on the coating stability and antifouling performance. Critical knowledge will be obtained enables the development of prototype product showing year-long reliability and top marine antifouling function.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast, precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences, specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. 

During the Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs. The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address the growing 2PM market.

Collaborative robotics is poised to revolutionize manufacturing where they will enable better utilization of factory space and machines, reduce energy cost, and mitigate labor shortages. Safe operation is a critical factor for successful operation of collaborative robotics, especially if they are mobile. The proposed project will demonstrate that tactile sensing skins can make robots safer, more collaborative, and manufactured at reasonable cost. The proposed task will also contribute to workforce development and enhance scientific understanding in the critical fields of robotics, soft robotics, and artificial intelligence, as well as providing opportunities for local students.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate a novel type of tactile sensing skin to improve robot safety and its ability to interact with human users. Unlike previous work, the proposed skin can detect obstacles from a distance of up to 20cm, as well as measuring contact and force. Also, the ability to detect user gestures such as tapping, rubbing or poking, opens new avenues for human-robot interaction and will enable the study of truly collaborative robots. The proposed research and development project will overcome the following key challenges that stand in the way of commercializing the technology: scaling from single patches to full-body sensing skins, fusing proximity data collected from the skin with those provided by conventional 3D sensors, and demonstrating its benefits in a series of real-world use cases.

"abstractText": "This project, from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), extends this institution's existing Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and entrepreneurship.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. Sites that received funding for three years during the early years of I-Corps may apply for a second award for an additional three years, called a Type II proposal. This project from RIT is a Type II project.

Since becoming a Site in 2014, Simone Center has vetted and counseled several hundred potential teams and advanced approximately 300 of them through I-Corps training. Program learning outcomes and evaluations with student/faculty participants provided significant insights, which have been operationalized and employed to improve offerings. Over the past three years, RIT and the regional ecosystem benefitted significantly from NSF's I-Corps Site designation and support. It has actively gained from and contributed to the National Innovation Network (NIN) learning community. RIT's Site Program is also in close collaboration with the regional NSF I-Corps Node, which is composed of Cornell University, University of Rochester, and RIT. 

There are a number of broader impacts for this project: during the next phase, particular emphasis will be placed on recruiting traditionally underrepresented participants in entrepreneurship, as well as training the deaf community, while furthering the advancement of access and inclusion technology projects; a new generation of students and faculty will be educated about I-Corps (lean startup) methodologies and fostering the creation of early-stage ventures; and, the regional ecosystem and National Innovation Network will profit from the outcomes of the RIT Site projects.

"abstractText": "This I-Corps Site at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will increase the quality and quantity of commercializable student projects, leveraging its core strengths in diversity and experiential learning to advance innovation, entrepreneurship, and commercialization outcomes. 

RIT has a track record for innovation. The Simone Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship's Student Incubator advanced approximately 100 multidisciplinary teams during 2012. These teams are supported by the Simone Center's faculty Innovation Council with representatives from all of RIT's colleges. Funding from the NSF I-Corp program will expand the number of teams that will receive funding for prototyping/proof of concepts supplies, coach expense, and exploratory customer market activities. The Simones Center's approach to entrepreneurship is experiential and multidisciplinary. RIT is situated to pioneer an I-Corps Site because of its history with experiential learning (coop, industry relationships, history of practitioners in the classroom etc.) and its program diversity. The Simone Center programs integrate technology, design, and business perspectives in a holistic manner. Teams simultaneously enter a program with formalized training and curriculum and weekly coaching by an experienced cohort of industry-based entrepreneurs and product developers. 

This proposal provides broader impacts to society and Rochester region in several ways:
-The Creation of Entrepreneurial Assets: RIT will increase the number of graduates with an emphasis on STEM and design with business creation/tech commercialization knowledge, experience, and teams building skills to innovate throughout their careers.
-New Ventures: The Student Incubator has and will continue to create a variety of companies that have growth and provided economic development to the struggling Rochester Region. 
-Pipeline Development: RIT will provide a pre-seed/early stage pipeline for potential new ventures.  
-Successful Undergraduate Innovation Processes: This program promotes and advances the development of balanced student teams, experienced coaching, and access to university support services (prototyping labs, faculties, and other expertise). 
-Integration with a Preexisting Business Incubator: The Simone Center's programs and events target early stage business development. The Simone Center's Student Incubator Program transitions its investment ready projects/businesses to the pre-existing RIT Incubator allows each unit to focus on the a specific stage of new venture creation. This is also a potential process for learning and dissemination.
This is a project at an institution that serves a very large population of deaf students (the largest population in the nation). It has processes in place that will accommodate those and the other RIT students to explore entrepreneurship and innovation - 90% of all RIT students engage in a co-op experience. The Site design is student-centric, having the joint impact of launching innovative products and immersing students in an entrepreneurship curriculum. RIT has a track record of successes - in particular, they have a history of launching "game-centric" and visual media products.


The Site has the potential to have a large regional impact in a part of the country that has been economically depressed. There is a large team of volunteers willing to mentor students as well as an Advisory Board to guide the programs."

Over a three year period, fourteen U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and three undergraduate students from the Monroe Community College Geospatial Information Science and Technology program (MCC) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Rwanda Center for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (CGIS). Significant activities include student access to and learning from CGIS on displaced population natural disaster resilience issues unique to Rwanda, East African context student research training activities, and access to disaster management organizations focused on displaced people such as the Rwandan Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR) only available in Rwanda. The project will create unique linkages to East African organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop 17 STEM student research scientists over three years focused on disaster resilience, displacement and GIS. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups as we will fully leverage RIT's existing underrepresented recruitments networks such as RIT's large Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing population, women, and minorities. The MCC student will create a unique opportunity for undergraduate international research experience as well as community college international research capacity development. Displaced people in Rwanda will also benefit through their participation as field research assistants as well as the research providing outreach and advocacy for their situations. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as community-scale resilience maps displacement resilience indexes will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to displacement and disaster resilience research and GIS. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of Rwandan and East African research networks only available by being on-site in Rwanda. CGIS and MIDIMAR for the first time become linked to NSF research. Workshops on disasters and resilience GIS mapping will be conducted by IRES students with Rwandan secondary schools and disaster stakeholder groups for broader project outreach. If successful, findings will be generalizable for additional internationally-focused research beyond displaced population natural disaster resilience in Rwanda (for example, the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises) and particularly US-national interest disaster resilience and displacement issues like seen in hurricanes Harvey and Maria, creating the potential for broader US-national and international research on displaced population natural disaster resilience that can provide future students with the knowledge, motivation and inspiration to pursue internationally-focused science careers to solve US-national and global challenges.

The primary student research project goal is community-level scale field mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of resilience indicators relevant to displaced population natural disaster resilience. Data collected by IRES students will be used as an input for spatially modeling, indexing and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people. The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between displacement and natural disaster resilience. Spatial indexes of displaced population natural disaster resilience currently do not exist at any scale -  let alone at the community-level scale that will only be possible to investigate through the foreign research site. Student research efforts will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) the spatial relationships between displacement and disaster resilience, (b) how developing displacement disaster resilience spatial metrics can inform displacement planning, and (c) how resilience is developed and manifested in displacement and disaster contexts to inform disaster management decision making and risk-reduction. Rwanda is a unique location for research on mapping and quantifying displaced population natural disaster resilience due to both refugee populations and internally displaced Rwandan citizens who face natural disaster risks. Access to these diverse and unique groups is only possible by being in Rwanda.

Highlights of collaborative activities include student access to and learning from UNU-EHS, UBonn, and other international disaster risk reduction experts, student research training activities, spatial data set acquisition, and access to international scientific networks only available in Bonn. The primary student research project is to create and rigorously evaluate a Disaster Risk Reduction - Information Capacity Index (DRR-ICI). A DRR-ICI currently does not exist. The scientific purpose of the DRR-ICI is to quantify and evaluate how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities such as information availability, scale and relevancy vary within Germany and from country to country. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating unique linkages to international organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop the next generation of interdisciplinary STEM research scientists focused on disaster risk reduction and GIS. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as the DRR-ICI, will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to disaster risk reduction research and GIS potentially saving lives when disasters occur.

Technical abstract:
The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between geographic information capacity and disaster risk reduction ? an area that has received little research attention despite the overall importance of geographic information for disaster risk reduction. Student research efforts to create and evaluate a DRR-ICI will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacity is itself a disaster risk factor, (b) how geographic information capacity can be tied to geographic information best practices, and (c) comparing geographic information capacities between countries and sub-national levels within countries to inform disaster management decision making. The DRR-ICI developed by students will provide practical, intellectual products for disaster risk reduction teaching and learning that can transition into real use in the event of a disaster."

Current deep learning approaches require large amounts of labeled data.  Creation of labeled data is expensive, error prone and time consuming. The proposed software will provide fully automated capabilities for semi-supervised learning for anomaly detection in cyber security applications. All businesses ranging from large scale enterprises to boutique data science consulting firms will benefit from this project. The expected impact can range in the billions of dollars in the areas of cyber security and predictive maintenance, to name just two. More broadly the proposed technologies will enable both corporations and public institutions to harvest large datasets at minimal cost.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop, and deploy high-performance computing (HPC) software for unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. In the last decades tremendous successes in machine learning have been achieved in the area of supervised learning that requires compilation of large datasets with labels (for example, grouping of pictures based on the individual depicted on the image). In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labels and thus require minimal human participation. However, due to significant technical difficulties they have not been as successful as supervised learning algorithms. This software package circumvents these difficulties and opens the way to scaling unsupervised learning algorithms to large and complex datasets.  The main research and development challenges that will be addressed in this project are the ability to integrate this new technology with real world complex datasets through the choice of the correct comparison function between the objects of the dataset and the fully automatic algorithm and algorithm parameter selection.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will provide prototype products to satisfy customer needs in prioritized wearable sensor market segments for the endurance sports market. One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017 NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues. Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution. This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health outcomes for all patients.  

A monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible, lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically, the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor, validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners. As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their progress in both training and competitive settings.

Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital."

Dr. Michael Lim of Rowan University will take 15 undergraduate students, between 2017-2019, to perform 10-week-long summer projects hosted by physics groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.  NTU is a top-tier international university known for its outstanding science and engineering research.  Students will have unparalleled access to state-of-the-art laser/optical instrumentation and mentorship by Dr. Rainer Dumke and Dr. Claus-Dieter Ohl, well known international experts in their respective fields of atom optics and fluid flows.  The program is designed to immerse students in activities that include designing and constructing optical apparatus, and collecting and analyzing data.  Simultaneously, students will build the communication skills needed for future international collaboration.  Through mini-projects at Edmund Optics, Inc., they will also connect their academic work to industry, allowing them a first-hand look at the interconnectedness of academic research and international business.  A diverse student cohort will be recruited annually from Philadelphia-area institutions that include Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Delaware State University, University of Delaware, Bryn Mawr College, and Temple University.

Leveraging the strong optics education students at this consortium of schools, the selected cohort will be assigned summer projects in the Quantum Technology (Dumke) and Fluid Dynamics (Ohl) research groups, focusing on laboratory measurements in either ultra-cold atomic physics or modern fluid dynamics.  They will run projects that use optical manipulation or measurement to study laser-frequency stabilization, laser-cooled atoms near superconductors, pattern formation in microfluidic channels, and laser-produced shockwaves in liquids.   This research may result in the co-authorship of refereed journal articles, and all students will be expected to give presentations at scientific professional meetings in the U.S.  The scientific knowledge, technical skills, and experience in global collaboration that participants acquire will provide a competitive edge as students embark on their future career paths."

Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems."

The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques.

The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations.

The personalized medicine concepts are based on individual genome variants and the personalized medicine market is expected to reach $178 billion in 2022. The cost advantage of a fast and accurate variant-finding product will be proportional to the number of genomes analyzed by users in this market. There has been a recent exponential increase in the size and scope of whole genome sequencing projects from 10,000 publicly available human genomes in 2016 to the UK 100,000 Genomes Project to even larger, though less-clearly defined, sequencing projects involving 1,000,000 participants proposed in the US (Precision Medicine Initiative, and Million Veteran Program) and China. In a likely and important scenario of sequencing the whole US population in the foreseeable future, the cost saving could be several billion dollars, thus making such efforts more feasible.

This I-Corps project will enable entrepreneurial education and customer discovery for a software that will be based on a novel comprehensive method of genome variant detection, GROM (Genome Rearrangement Omni-Mapper). GROM boasts lightning-speed runtimes, an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art variant detection pipelines. While drastically reducing computational time, GROM provides superior overall variant detection compared to commonly employed algorithms. These unique advantages over available tools both in speed and precision could make GROM a very desirable application in this field (utilized via either licensing or pay-per-use commercial models). This will require a better understanding of a potential market and customer discovery. The process will include an educational component at I-Corps workshops and a discovery component via meetings and active communication with numerous potential users of the technology in commercial and non-commercial entities. The customer discovery effort may result in developing an appropriate business plan for attracting investments in a potential startup that will perform further development and licensing of the product.

"abstractText": "This project, from Rutgers University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Rutgers University has funded research of over $600M per year. This research generates over 150 patents each year and more than $15M in licensing income annually. A challenge is to transition research outcomes to the commercialization stage. The Rutgers University I-Corps Site cultivates this pool of early stage ideas and assists with bringing viable concepts through the commercialization pathway to the marketplace. Through the I-Corps Site, with targeted training and mentoring, I-Corps teams are sourced from the Rutgers Site partners. These include the Office of Research Commercialization, educational activities ranging from the Collaboration for Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization (CTEC) and Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs, senior-year "capstone" engineering design and Honors College programs, and many other feeder programs. Mentors are matched to these teams. Inventors benefit from the larger innovation ecosystem in the New Jersey/New York region, as the Site partners with the NYCRIN I-Corps Node. 

The Rutgers I-Corps Site provides training, mentoring, and access to a large network of business, technical and financial resources. The signature activity of this program is that each year, 30 teams participate and test the commercial potential of their products with a broad base of consumers. This program promotes the value of commercialization to both faculty and students, and reinforces the concept that ideas generated by the academic research process can have societal and commercial value.

The Rutgers I-Corps bridges the gap between the lab and the marketplace, enhancing the University's commitment to fostering economic development across New Jersey and beyond. As the number of spin-outs from the university increases, jobs are created and companies hire students as interns and graduates as full-time employees. The program's impact goes beyond the University by tapping into local business leaders and entrepreneurs for team mentorship as well as expanding programs to support the communities around Rutgers campuses and to particularly assist underrepresented inventors and business-owners. A key area of focus is to increase I-Corps participation from women in STEM and ultimately to increase the number of women-owned businesses in the region/state."

The Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca (GREAT) project will use a diverse array of geoscience methods to investigate the origins, the current state, and the hazard potential of the Cordillera Talamanca (CT) in southern Costa Rica. This region is unique in Central America because of its lack of active volcanism, its extreme (and geologically recent) high elevations, and its history of unusually distributed large earthquakes. 

The project will use resources of the University of Costa Rica: The School of Geology and the civil engineering research center (Laboratorio Nacional de Materiales y Modelos Estructurales, LanammeUCR,), and also the research facilities of the national power company of Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE).

Over the course of three years, 18 undergraduate students will participate in the project. They will collect new data on seismic wave propagation, gravity field strength, and the shape of the Earth's surface. They will  merge new observations with existing data into a unified knowledge base to increase understanding of the region. They will analyze combined data sets to answer specific questions about this region, such as "Why are Cordillera Talamanca so high?", "Where are zones of present internal deformation?", and "What factors control slope stability?", and use newly gained knowledge to assess landslide hazards along the Pan-American highway in the CT. 

Integration of the GREAT project into the university-wide Aresty Research Assistant program will raise the visibility of Earth Sciences at Rutgers, making participation of historically underrepresented groups more likely. Assessment of the program's outcomes will be helpful in devising future efforts aimed at expanding participation of US diverse student population in natural science research. 

The international collaborations forged during the project will establish institutional links between a large US public university (Rutgers) and the premier research and educational institution in Central America (University of Costa Rica).  


Technical abstract

The Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca (GREAT) research and education project will pursue three distinct research avenues.

1.	We will study the interior structure of the Cordillera Talamanca region through a combination of gravity and seismic methods. Improved constraints on the distribution of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes. We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.  

2.	We will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c) using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  

3.	We will investigate the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.

During each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in the country. Students will collect new data and perform basic data processing and analysis tasks while in Costa Rica, and will develop individualized research projects over the course of subsequent academic year, when they will be enrolled in a university-wide Aresty Research Assistantship program."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project arises from bringing new materials to market for making improved rechargeable lithium ion batteries needed by the high-tech economy, medicine, and the military (batteries are the second largest military consumable). In today's world, everything, including medical devices (e.g., wireless implants and sensors), has an app; using apps requires batteries. This project will produce "Safer Energy for the Wireless World"; the resulting improved batteries will incorporate novel, lighter, and safer (no overheating) anode materials that will charge faster and store more energy than current versions. The new anode materials are estimated upon success to yield sales of $1B during the first 10 years from selling the materials to battery manufacturers to incorporate, initially, as composites in lithium ion battery anodes, and, later, as the entire active anode. Broader societal impacts include greater safety because the batteries do not overheat; lighter, more portable devices with longer battery life and faster recharging time; reduced need for backup batteries; and diverse STEM workforce development though applied research and entrepreneurship training.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop safer, more powerful ways to charge electronic devices by translating fundamental research from university to industry. The opportunity arises from an NSF-supported discovery of the first solid form of carbon monoxide known, a two-dimensional crystal structure: graphene monoxide (GmO). GmO and its first proposed application for anodes in lithium ion batteries are patented. Knowledge gaps to be addressed include identifying tailored materials for optimizing batteries for electronics, using theoretical and experimental approaches to identify the maximum energy storage capacity for lithium batteries, and determining the energy and power densities and safety properties under normal and extreme operating conditions. The technology must be demonstrated in 200-mAh pouch batteries, the first milestone needed for battery manufacturers to consider adopting the innovation through licensing or sales. The second milestone is to scale up materials to produce large quantities. The overall goal is to commercialize the GmO material into an active anode or additive material for extreme batteries. In sum, the project will yield prototype batteries made from the new materials, optimize properties for specific partner applications, simulate interactions between GmO and Li, and identify pathways for scaleup of materials production.

VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.

The intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group. Instructor feedback will be gathered through a mixed methods study.

A major problem in medical research is that a majority of clinical trials are delayed or canceled because of insufficient recruitment of eligible participants. By developing an independent (third-party) data aggregation platform for detailed electronic patient data through this project, researchers will be able to efficiently reach a large pool of potential participants for trials, and increase the likelihood of trial success. The resulting platform will create a much more efficient recruitment system, as the data is shared among the broader research community rather than managed by any individual research organization. With subscriptions and fees per enrolled patient, the platform will be able sustain itself while at the same time lowering recruitment costs for researchers. More broadly, the greater ability to design and execute successful clinical trials will be a huge benefit to the medical community and accelerate the pace of research and new product development. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of clinical trial design and recruitment. Research organizations like pharmaceutical companies and hospitals typically maintain isolated databases with limited, static patient data. This project focuses on building a third-party data platform that elegantly stores and organizes electronic patient data. The design of the platform enables ontological queries, allowing researchers to consult data when designing trials and quickly ?testing? specific inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine feasibility. When proceeding to execute the trial, the platform will rank individuals by likelihood to enroll, and facilitate contact with potential patients that have previously provide consent to be contacted. Initial objectives of the project include the development of a methodology to abstract patient data from medical records, and programming of the database structure. Later the work will focus on quality assurance software, and algorithms to translate free-text trial requirements into filters compatible with said database. The expected outcome is a platform storing accurate data of 200 patients, with filtering and ranking algorithms that match patients to trials with nearly the same accuracy of an experienced recruitment team.

It is estimated that the global counterfeit market will grow from $1.2 Trillion in 2017 to more than $1.8 Trillion by 2020. In an attempt to combat this trend, spending on anticounterfeit packaging will grow from $122 Billion in 2017 to $264 Billion by 2023. Of most dire concern, the counterfeit pharmaceutical industry is estimated at approximately $200 Billion, resulting in about 1 million deaths annually. Existing anti-counterfeit packaging techniques have proven largely ineffective in combating this counterfeiting problem. This project will result, for the first time, in packaging or seals that, without ambiguity, inform users of the authenticity, integrity, and provenance of any product outfitted with the project?s resultant technology. All stakeholders in a supply chain will be enabled to detect fake goods before they can be used or consumed. This increased visibility into the supply chain will also broaden enforcement opportunities for relevant entities and/or authorities and provide special benefit to those industries most urgently impacted: pharmaceuticals, military/defense products and high-priced goods. 

The proposed innovation is a novel enhancement to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) that seals any package or container to which it is attached and, when queried by a reader/interrogator (e.g. any modern smartphone), provides the status (i.e. tampered/un-tampered) and identity to the user or system. The project will produce the designs and manufacturing techniques required to create RFID-based seals that provide assurance of authenticity, integrity, and provenance for products to which these seals are applied. Research will be conducted on several specific hardware components required by this innovation and will produce the requisite software and cryptographic systems for the testing, design, and commercialization of this proposed solution to product counterfeiting. Developed software will provide the testing and development framework for commercial applications of the proposed anti-counterfeiting solution. Advances in hardware design, especially concerning the minimization of power requirements for the RFID-based seals and the manufacturing techniques for specific required hardware components (i.e. the components that detect tampering events) will be accomplished during this research project. Research and development activities will employ varied techniques including iterative design, 3D printing, and advanced electronics prototyping.

Current simulation tools require everything to be set up by hand which, even for trained experts, is time consuming and error prone. Also, the computational design and prototyping of photonic devices involves too much trial and error. Our turn-key, on-demand, cloud platform will: (1) reduce design time by 50%, (2) lower the unit cost of simulations by an order of magnitude, and (3) enable first-time users with no prior training in electromagnetic simulations to get up and running with manufacturing-ready designs in a matter of weeks not months.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a practical method for ultra-secure global communication using quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is an established communications protocol which promises unbreakable encryption via the exchange of single photons, the constituent particles of light. Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat. The proposed design will take a substantial step forward from the first and only demonstration of satellite-to-ground QKD (Micius, 2017), which relied on technology that is too massive, expensive, and low-throughput for commercial use. Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems. In Phase I, detailed modeling and simulation of candidate payload designs will be used to evaluate the commercial and technical feasibility of the proposed approach, and to select a preliminary design for initial implementation, which will commence in Phase II.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to offers a way for semiconductor chip fabricators to extend Moore's Law and simultaneously allowing them to reduce costs in consumables and scrap wafers that have been damaged during polishing. Currently chip fabricators are challenged to continue Moore's Law due to the complexity and scale down sizes of semiconductor device structures. Improved computer chip performance is critical to countless applications as computers,mobile phones, tablets, and Internet of Thing have become ubiquitous in everyday life.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenges which the semiconductor industry faces trying to move beyond 14 nm technologies by using Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Polishing pads are used to planarize wafer surface for multilayer stack integration. Conventional polishing pad technology has randomly distributed micro pores that lead to non-uniform polishing and scratched due to stress concentration on asperities with less than 1% real contact area. Additionally, conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to re-generate pad surface. This project proposes engineering micro features on the pad surface using micro fabrication technologies. In addition, the real contact area between the pad and wafer will be controllable increasing to 5-10 percent of the total pad-wafer contact. This will make the polishing performance more precise and consistent. The micro features are designed to retain polishing slurry longer so to increase the number of active slurry abrasives for polishing. The contact area and feature design will be tunable to specific polishing performance requirements per customer applications. The independent multi-body structure of a hard top-pad with a soft sub-pad will increase the conformity of the pad and distribute the pressure from polishing evenly across the pad surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity, as well as reducing the pad wear during polishing.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is increased revenue and processing potential for scrap recyclers in the US. The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals.

The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an artificially-intelligent algorithm that is capable of optimizing scrap sortation in real-time. The research objectives include:&#8239;(1) identify all data sources in the scrap recycling process that &#8239;can &#8239;influence intelligent decision making (2)&#8239;design a database to host identified data sources such as compositional, market, inventory, and sales data and (3) design a customized artificially-intelligent algorithm for the&#8239; scrap &#8239;recycling industry to develop sorting criteria in real-time. To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project examines the feasibility of using magnetic sensors based on Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) for neurological imaging. Information about brain activity is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The most powerful non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, magnetoencephalography (MEG), uses magnetometers that require liquid helium cooling and magnetic shielding to operate. Due to these requirements, current MEG systems are large and expensive, limiting their adoption and accessibility. ADFMR sensors could allow for the measurement of biomagnetic fields without the need for cryogenics and magnetic shielding, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of such systems. The portability of this improved technology would allow for functional neuroimaging outside of the carefully controlled imaging suites where it is possible today. This could allow for diagnosis of previously unreachable patients (ie. in the ICU, operating room, or ambulance) as well as the development of new uses for this technology (ie. long-term monitoring, scanning during movement). This improved, portable MEG could also enable the first practical, portable brain-computer interface ? applicable across a wide variety of applications in both defense and consumer sectors.

This SBIR Phase I project investigates the ability for ADFMR sensors to measure extremely small magnetic fields, such as those generated by the human brain. The ADFMR phenomenon has been shown to be a much more power and size efficient alternative to traditional methods of exciting ferromagnetic resonance, allowing for its use as a sensing mechanism for chip-scale magnetometers. In the proposed program, a number of methods to improve the performance of current ADFMR devices will be investigated. First, a compact model will be developed to allow for fast modeling of ADFMR devices and their associated detection circuitry. Using the results of this model, devices will be fabricated in order to experimentally validate various mechanisms for the reduction of 1/f noise in the detector circuitry and for the optimization of the ADFMR absorption profile for maximum sensitivity to applied magnetic fields. These sensor elements will initially be tested using standard benchtop characterization equipment. Following a benchtop demonstration, challenges in miniaturizing the full sensor system will be addressed by developing fully integrated magnetometer prototypes.

The automated reading of student reflections for quality and content is a new and innovative technology that is currently not available in the market, as all applications in this realm focus on grammar and writing structures. The innovation will understand the specific actions and strategies students are using (many of which are unique to an individual learner), and help students get the support they need to improve in those techniques or try new ones. This process would build learning skills and growth-oriented belief systems in students, both of which lead to significantly improved academic and career outcomes. Fundamentally, the proposed project will help students learn how to learn.


This SBIR Phase I project will build the first phase of personalized insights for impactful student goal-setting and reflection. The company will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML algorithms to 1) parse, process, and analyze reflections written by students, 2) return a score for each reflection based on a research-based rubric, and 3) notify teachers when a student has a low score and needs support. At the end of Phase I, the company will examine whether the prototype functions as intended with 90%+ accuracy, if teachers can integrate the prototype into their classroom practice, and if it shows early promise of improving the quality of student reflections and learning. With a proprietary dataset of 400K+ written student reflections and data points, the company is uniquely positioned to develop and scale this product vision. Phase II research will develop personalized feedback, strategies and suggestions to help students and teachers find the best strategies faster.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as one of the best tools to catalogue cell types and understand their function.  The key advantage of scRNA-seq is that it provides transcriptome-wide information about individual cells in heterogeneous samples while alternative methods either provide information about only a limited set of genes (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR) or cannot provide single-cell resolution (bulk RNA-seq, microarrays).  However, current scRNA-seq approaches remain expensive, enable only limited sample multiplexing, and are not compatible with common sample storage conditions. This project will focus on the key technical challenges that are required to develop universally applicable scRNA-seq kits that meet customer needs. If successful, the end product will be a scRNA-seq kit that is ready for pilot testing with academic and pharmaceutical company customers. By reducing the cost and increasing sample size and sample multiplexing of scRNA-seq, the technology will improve the ability to understand multicellular systems and enhance workflows used in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drug screening and patient stratification.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR  Phase I project is to develop a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method by using a combinatorial barcoding scheme that labels transcripts within fixed cells.  The proposed technology makes it possible to measure the transcriptional profiles of hundreds of thousands of individual cells in parallel. Unlike previous scRNA-seq technologies, the technology also enables high sample multiplexing (up to 96 samples/experiment), is compatible with stored samples, and fixes cells before dissociation, reducing the risk of perturbations to gene expression during cell handling. Most importantly, the method requires no complex instruments, which contributes to making the technology an order of magnitude less expensive than existing technologies. The objectives of this project are to dramatically improve the number of molecules detected per cell and to simplify the workflow for users. Modifications to assay chemistry will be tested to increase molecular detection, and time-consuming steps in the workflow will be altered to shorten the overall experimental time and reduce the probability of user error.

Advanced ecofriendly technologies that enhance cleaning efficiency are highly sought after in janitorial services for large institutions and homeowners alike. Specifically, the household cleaners market size was valued at $5.79 billion in 2016 in United States, of which ~20% is toilet bowl cleaners that aim to remove bacteria and hard-water stains.  From a societal perspective, we estimate that about 6.1 billion gallons of water is flushed down the toilet nationally each day - that is 2.2 trillion gal of water each year in the United States alone. Incorporation of this coating into bathroom fixtures, can significantly reduce the water footprint of bathroom fixtures. Viable low-flow or no-flow toilets may also help help address the open defecation problem affecting over 1 billion people globally.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and investigate a new class of viscoelastic-repellent surface coatings with anti-bacterial and anti-scaling functions for cleaning and sanitation industries. Surface coatings that can resist bacteria and mineral fouling while maintaining both liquid and viscoelastic solid repellency are rare. The proposed project will investigate and quantify the coating design parameters required to significantly prevent the attachment of bacteria and mineral deposits, while remaining durable against mechanical abrasions under realistic operating conditions. This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate that a sprayable surface coating not only can repel both liquids and viscoelastic solids, but can also resist fouling from bacteria and hard water stains without the use of aggressive chemical cleaners or excessive amounts of water. The best coating parameters identified in Phase I project will be considered for pilot tests in Phase II. The development of such a robust, non-fouling coating will offer significant reduction in the use of cleaning chemicals, flush water, and cleaning time, which has the potential to reduce costs associated with sanitation facilities maintenance.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology."

These new materials will overcome the undesirable properties of commercial fluorescent pigments, like a tendency to rapidly fade, give weak color strength, and degrade during processing. Besides giving fabrics, packaging, and toys bright, attractive colors, improvements to fluorescent pigments could change several parts of daily life: Brighter paints and signs could improve road and airport safety. Product designers for next-generation consumer electronics will have a new color palette for their newest gadget. Agricultural scientists would have a new tool to study crop treatments. As a result, success in this research project has the potential to claim a share of the multi-billion dollar colorant market, disrupt expectations around fluorescent pigments, bring new products to consumers, and create high-tech jobs. In addition, this project leverages collaboration with academic partners, supporting science and entrepreneurship education of university students and postdoctoral fellows.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides a revolutionary solution to a problem that has haunted chemistry for more than 150 years. Existing fluorescent materials are formulated with pigments that have thinly dispersed colorants, which dilutes their color and makes them susceptible to degradation. This is done by necessity, because fluorescent dyes have a tendency to aggregate, causing unwanted color changes and loss of the fluorescence effect. This solution utilizes a bottom-up "self-assembly" strategy to eliminate aggregation and create stable fluorescent solids that maximize the longevity and boldness of the color. This research will study this novel class of fluorescent pigment to gauge its resistance to fading, improved chromaticity, and material performance in realistic conditions. This will be done by measuring changes to fluorescence intensity and color appearance under natural and laboratory-accelerated weathering conditions, and creating test "products" in the form of paints and polymers. These test materials are expected to have stronger color for longer periods of time while still being amenable to commercial processing techniques. In addition, this project is an opportunity to study the behavior of self-assembling materials inside polymer formulations, which is a new research area with broad scientific and commercial potential.

Increasing the number and diversity of students entering, persisting and graduating with STEM degrees; and significantly aiding them with STEM internships and job placements is imperative to solving the critical national and state workforce deficit that encompasses 63 STEM occupations categorized by the U. S. Department of Labor. Improving STEM education pathways to engage and retain students in STEM programs requires creative interdisciplinary real world experiential learning strategies that integrate technology in delivering and reiterating content to 21st century learners.  Community colleges represent a special opportunity for increasing STEM majors. Two-year institutions are 'the entry point into higher education for most first-generation college students, particularly those from low-income, minority, and immigrant backgrounds'. Studies have shown that only 25 percent of these students complete a two-year degree and transfer to a four-year institution and only 17 percent complete a bachelor's degree. In 2000, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Community College Mentoring Program (BBCCMP) was founded to assist underrepresented minority, low income, and first generation community college students from six State University of New York (SUNY) community colleges with the transition from the two-year to four-year institutions and transitions either into the workforce or to graduate or professional school. The program involves tutoring, mentoring, and advising at the two and four-year institutions as well as a summer research program. In the almost fifteen years of the program, over 300 students have been involved. Over 80 percent of these students completed their Associate's degree and transferred to four-year institutions. Over 70 percent of these students are completing their bachelor's degree and 33 percent are going on for post-graduate work. This I-Corps for Learning project will develop ways to extend the impact of this program to other institutions throughout the country.

The BBCCMP Program at Purchase College provides an extensive array of student supports. These begin when the student is recruited from the community college. Faculty coordinators at the community college identify and advise students who wish to enter the program. In addition, the program provides peer tutors and mentors at the community college. Students participate in a summer research program that not only provides research opportunities, but also has workshops on skills building, transferring, and career and post-baccalaureate opportunities. Students also participate in cohort and career building. In 2010 the SUNY Replication Project created a New York-based ecosystem in STEM based on the success of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Program within SUNY. Subsequently, six regional hubs comprising a mixture of two-year and four-year institutions were formed, and representatives met again at a second conference in 2012, to scale-up working with community colleges on student transitions. Through the NSF I-Corps initiative, this project will investigate sustainable methods to expand the success of BBCCMP to a larger number of institutions."

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Binghamton I-Corps Site strengthens the ecosystem at Binghamton University. By integrating existing innovation support programs and technology transfer with entrepreneurship and business incubation services, technologies stemming from faculty research, student ingenuity, and community innovators are evaluated for commercial viability. Experienced technology transfer professionals, technical experts resident in Binghamton's industry-facing centers, and on-staff entrepreneurship and financial advisers recruit teams and promote promising teams into the program.

Entrepreneurship and engineering faculty, entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs), and community coaches and mentors stimulate ideation and team building, and guide the innovators through theory and practice, and, ultimately, the go / no-go decision. By virtue of a rigorous selection process and hands-on training, the teams with customer-validated, technology- and manufacturing-feasible products and services proceed with commercialization with further support from the university, local businesses, and funders, as well as the I-Corps regional and national nodes. The process creates a growing cadre of entrepreneurs who continue to innovate, build businesses, mentor and invest in others, and overall recharge the entrepreneurial ecosystem, making Binghamton and the University a hub for entrepreneurs, investors, and start-up companies.

The Binghamton I-Corps Site is meant to transform the mindset of University faculty, staff and students, as well as that of community members and leaders by providing a practical, achievable approach to generating new, sustainable ventures built around technologies. Demonstrating this path forward creates positive and powerful relationships between universities, the local business, professional services and investor communities, industry, and government. Generating trust and interactions between academia-private sector-government has ripple effects far beyond the teams going through the program, and propagate a self-sustaining, entrepreneurial ecosystem driven and replenished by new launches. Furthermore, by bringing together entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, this Site program blurs lines separating big and small business, manufacturing and service industries, academia and the private sector, and spurs efforts towards the common goal of value and job creation through new ventures. Successful launches of companies inspire Binghamton University researchers, students and graduates, and instill optimism about the prospects for creating wealth and fulfilling jobs in Binghamton, or wherever their careers take them throughout the nation."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the clinical utilization of cancer chemotherapy drugs by reducing toxic side effects and improving the therapeutic index. The key technology is based on the controlled release of chemo-drugs in response to tumor acidosis. The initial product is an acid-sensitive prodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a prominent chemo-drug commonly used in the treatment of breast, bladder, and other cancers (including the childhood cancers Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma). The current global annual market for Dox is ~$800M (~$400M in the US). Treatments of solid tumors that are likely to be acidic account for ~60-70% of Dox applications in the clinic. The Dox global market is projected to reach $1.38B by 2024. This pH-sensitive prodrug of Dox may be considered an improved version of Dox for treating acidic solid tumors. Also, this technology could be expanded to other chemo-drugs outside of the anthracycline class. Furthermore, acidic microenvironments are found not only in cancerous tumors, but also in other disease states, such as sites of inflammation and the ischemic myocardium during heart attacks, which represent other potential targets of the pH-sensitive prodrug technology in the future.

This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology for improving the safety profile of chemo-drugs by suppressing drug release at healthy tissues, while preferentially releasing drugs at tumor sites. The targeted drug release would be triggered by tumor acidosis. Due to rapid growth, many cancerous tumors have extracellular pH (pHe) in the range of 6.5-6.9, compared with pHe of 7.2-7.4 in healthy tissues. Tumor acidosis can be considered as a universal biomarker of the cancer microenvironment and correlates with poor prognosis (i.e., more acidic tumors are usually found in more aggressive cancers). To turn tumor acidosis against cancer, this team developed ultra-acid-sensitive, small molecule prodrugs to selectively release Dox in response to acidic tumor pHe. The critical challenge of developing an ultra-sensitive pH biosensor that can distinguish between pHe 7.4 and 6.7 has been met from the basic science side by using an acid-sensitive linker. Preliminary data indicate that these prodrugs can release ~ 4-fold more Dox at pH 6.7 vs. 7.4 in cell culture settings.

Solar panel manufacturing depends heavily on conductive pastes in the manufacture of the conductive busbars and finger grids on the top of solar panels, with the market potential for the conductive pastes being currently estimated to be about $2 billion and its growth at a CAGR of 4%.  With silver components accounting for close to 20% of the current photovoltaic solar cell costs, 100-fold cheaper copper pastes can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost.  New materials developments have led to increases in copper paste sales and usages. Commercialization of this technology offers an opportunity to accelerate the demand for solar panels by supplying high-performance conductive pastes to solar panel manufacturers at attractive prices.

This I-Corps project focuses on determining the commercialization feasibility of a high performance and low-cost copper nanowire paste technology to help photovoltaic solar panel manufacturers who suffer from the pain of high-cost silver paste that requires high processing temperature and is subject to corrosion of silver grid fingers to degrade the electrical performance. Customer discovery will be performed to test a number of initial hypotheses, identify the market opportunity, and develop the business model.  Manufacturing of silicon-based solar cells involves screen printing of conductive silver pastes as front electrodes to provide good contact and efficient electrical performance. Major barriers include high cost of silver, high-temperature manufacturing process and corrosion of silver grid fingers. These barriers will be overcome by using new copper nanowire pastes that are sinterable and oxidation-resistant at room temperature for manufacturing highly conductive electrodes on solar panels.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to minimize the risk of pressure ulcer formation in wheelchair users. In addition, this project will reduce the labor and cost associated with treating and preventing ulcers. Pressure ulcers are serious injuries that afflict those who are may already be suffering from other ailments such as paralysis and diabetes. They are often overlooked until it is too late, posing serious morbidity and mortality risk. Pressure ulcer prevention is a continuous job, and treatment of established ulcers is costly. Caretakers must constantly check, adjust, and turn at-risk wheelchair bound patients for the duration of the day. This is even more problematic with the nationwide staffing shortage in nursing homes. The most effective available cushions are cost prohibitive for most at-risk individuals and care facilities. Moreover, cushions that are widely used are prone to breaking, resulting in reoccurring costs and the need to reestablish constant care. Aside from the facilities and individuals who are affected, insurance companies in the US spend over $11 billion in treatment of ulcers every year and ulcers are the 2nd largest cause of medical malpractice lawsuits in the US.

This I-Corps project will develop a new wheelchair cushion that can minimize pressure ulcer onset. Prolonged sitting can lead to extreme discomfort, the breakdown of skin tissue, and the development of pressure ulcers. Strategies to mitigate this issue are based primarily on the principles of immersion and offloading. Immersion is the process of distributing interfacial pressure evenly across a surface. This is normally achieved with a foam or air cushion. Offloading is the process of suspending a specific region of the body in the air to remove and or redistribute pressure. To date, traditional strategies are ineffective in managing pressure ulcers. Immersion techniques can only reduce pressure magnitudes. Offloading cushions result in increased pressure and risk of pressure ulcer formation at support sites. This project develops a cushion that utilizes targeted offloading of high-risk areas to remove pressure alongside cyclic alternating pressure to prevent prolonged tissue deformation in non-offloaded sites. Furthermore, the rechargeable battery powered cushion is compact and quiet, so it does not interfere with a user's daily life.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on its focus on promoting balanced human microflora. The project aims at commercial development of a novel prebiotic and probiotic skincare line to improve skin appearance and overall health. Considering the increasing recognition of the importance of microflora in human health and the growing demand for natural products, the focus is on developing prebiotic and probiotic skincare product lines to fit within the $10-billion+ organic beauty market. However, the approach has broader implications for the general skincare and healthcare markets. Currently, most treatments for skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis ignore the bacterial component, instead utilizing harsh chemical and invasive solutions. If successful, efforts will ultimately shift toward more intrinsic and natural solutions that aid the body in healing itself, without contributing to further disruption of skin integrity. As the skin and its associated bacteria contribute to defending the body against environmental contaminants and foreign invaders, the approach also paves the way for novel prebiotic and probiotic products for promoting robust immune function. 

This I-Corps project focuses on the use of skin-associated microorganisms to improve overall appearance and health. Beneficial bacteria exist on the human body, helping it function properly and protecting it from various diseases. The skin is the largest organ of the immune system and the first line of defense against toxins and pathogens; the presence of beneficial skin bacteria is essential not only for appearance, but also for overall human health. The bacteria exist on the skin as cooperating, surface-attached communities. A balance of specific bacterial species, as well as proper attachment to the skin, is essential for the protective beneficial functions of these communities. Disruption of the microflora balance and/or of bacterial attachment to the skin can result in a variety of disorders. To promote skin health, the investigators have identified specific beneficial skin bacteria, as well as factors that promote the establishment of the functional bacterial communities--in particular, naturally produced factors that promote the attachment of bacteria to biotic surfaces, such as the skin. Based on those results, they have developed a system to balance the skin microbiome that utilizes proprietary probiotic formulations containing live skin-associated bacteria and prebiotic factors, which promote the interactions of these bacteria with the skin.

In particular, the project will advance the field of data-driven chemical research by promoting the use of machine learning and other data mining techniques in the molecular sciences and by fostering and coalescing a community of stakeholders. The work of the project and the community it represents aims to transform chemistry's ability to tackle challenging discovery and design problems. This approach can dramatically accelerate and streamline the process that leads to chemical innovation -- an important factor in economic and technological advancement -- and thus result in an improved return on public and private investments. The project also addresses corresponding questions of training and workforce development needed in chemistry, thus insuring the US's international competitiveness. 

The mission of this project is to assert the role of big data research in the chemical domain, i.e., to promote, enable, and advance the ideas of data-driven discovery and rational design. The project aims to create a community-driven roadmap as well as facilitate concrete solutions that are beyond the scope of the disjointed efforts of its individual stakeholders. The Big Data Hubs and Spokes ecosystem is the ideal framework to realizing this vision and accelerating progress in this high-priority area of research. The effort at hand sets out to implement some of the key findings of the recent NSF Division of Chemistry workshop on Framing the Role of Big Data and Modern Data Science in Chemistry. The four signature initiatives of this Spoke project include (i) the planning, coordination, integration, and consolidation of community-developed software tools for big data research in chemistry as well as the formulation of guidelines, best practices, and standards; (ii) the organization of workshops for community building, to connect solution seekers with solution providers, and to address questions ranging from strategic to technical; and (iii) the creation and dissemination of community-developed teaching materials as well as the formulation of course, program, and curricular recommendations for education and workforce development that reflect the changing, data-centric approach in chemical research; (iv) providing access to a shared hardware infrastructure for community data sets, on-site data mining capacity, and the exploration of domain specific method and hardware issues.

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Stony Brook developed a suite of programs for providing science and engineering-based assistance to companies with technology needs. This suite of programs has been successful in fostering the growth of enterprises, including startups. The Stony Brook campus leads SUNY in technology transfer performance - invention disclosures, patent applications, issued patents, and executed licenses. Its economic development/ industry assistance programs, which assists companies of any size at any stage of development, has a track record of promoting company growth - more than 3,500 projects, completed with more than 800 companies, have generated more than $900 million in corporate revenues. The oldest and largest Stony Brook incubator has exited some 80 companies with a 55% success record.

The Stony Brook I-Corps Site will capitalize on the prospective talent within its own faculty and student body and the discovery and innovation generated by sponsored investments in its research programs. Stony Brook's Site will collaborate with the University's academic leadership to focus assets on discovering and nurturing a new target, the entrepreneur, and structuring access to assets -  including the Long Island REACH Hub - to maximize innovation impact and create a permanent, sustainable entrepreneurial pipeline as both beneficiary of and stimulus for a larger innovation network.  

As a region of 2.8M people with a $143B Gross Metropolitan Product (2012), Stony Brook's location, Long Island, is larger than 19 states and a net contributor to New York's fiscal health. Its growth rate, however, has lagged the nation since 2010. Strengthening the regional innovation ecosystem may have long-term positive economic impacts across the state. Within the ecosystem itself, the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will not only transform the culture of the Stony Brook campus, creating a permanent vehicle to feed the new venture pipeline, which will be strengthened by a synergistic relationship with the proposed Long Island REACH Hub, but it will also broaden the impact of the established NYCRIN I-Corps Node, in which Stony Brook is a partner, by feeding it close to an additional 100 entrepreneurial teams over a three-year period. Regionally, the design of the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will extend the Site's impact by inviting entrepreneurial researchers from the region's other research institutions to participate."

The framework brings together computational thinking, design process, and programming to meet STEM imperatives and provide compelling value propositions for both the education and prototyping industry. The proposed robotics framework has the potential to fill 2.5 million unfilled jobs in STEM and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

This I-Corps project leverages the latest research in mechanism synthesis area to create novel algorithms for designing motions of planar linkage mechanisms. Planar linkage mechanisms are rigid bodies connected to one another using rotating or sliding joints and their special configurations give rise to desired motion. Their implementation in a mobile app provides users an ability to synthesize and simulate mechanisms for robots and machines. While, the robot hardware kit employs inexpensively produced novel planar and compliant pieces to create a new method of interconnection to realize three-dimensional geometry and mechanisms of robots and structures, the web-based CAD tool would allow users to design customized robot parts. The flexibility of the design allows for the use of any programming platform and any readily available sensors and actuators thereby dramatically broadening the inventions design capabilities.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.

Enzymes are used in household materials (detergents and cleaners) and in chemical processes (cheese production, and bioremediation of waste). Pathways can produce bioplastics from sugar by engineered gut bacteria, or artemisinin (an antimalarial) from sugar by yeast. These biological products are engineered in cells. Cellular engineering, however, requires extensive scientific expertise, financial and material resources, and time. This project will design an engineering platform that eliminates production in cells. The goal is to simplify engineering and decrease costs 20-100 fold, and decrease time 2-5 fold. This results in a faster time-to-market for novel biological products and additional information to inform the engineering process.
 
This STTR Phase II project proposes to utilize cell-free systems to speed up enzyme and pathway (metabolic) engineering. Cell-free systems can catalyze reactions without cellular complexity and without the need to maintain cellular growth. The goal of the project is to continue to develop a platform that can take as input user enzyme and pathway engineering questions and produce as output assay data. The primary focus is on developing computational methods for identification and optimization of enzymes and pathways for testing, molecular biological methods for assembling DNA, microfluidic methods for ultra-high-throughput analysis of cell-free expressions (10e7 samples), and analytical methods for detection. A secondary focus is the demonstration of this platform through cytochrome P450 engineering. Success with the primary focus demonstrates feasibility of replacing cellular engineering with faster and higher-throughput cell-free engineering processes. Success with the secondary focus produces directly-relevant enzymes for metabolic engineering pathways utilizing cytochrome P450s (e.g., natural products, bio-catalysis).

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects 5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest, currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of 4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia. 


The proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection; (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.

Michael D. Wasserman & Peter A. Beck, Environmental Science & Policy, St. Edward's University


Non-technical Project Description

Biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution are major threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life, especially for societies that directly depend upon the local environment for resources.  Addressing human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems. These ecosystems contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate change mitigation through carbon storage, and filter pollutants from water and air.  However, traditional conservation strategies that exclude local populations have often been ineffective leading to significant forest loss over the past several decades.  This NSF IRES research program will evaluate the effectiveness of alternative conservation strategies to maintain tropical forest ecosystems and primate populations, while also maintaining the livelihoods of local communities surrounding the forests.  Through this research program, underrepresented students in the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience.  The investigators will integrate ecological and social research methods to address questions critical to fields of ecology, anthropology, and environmental policy, address current environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, and provide STEM training for underrepresented students at two biological field stations in Costa Rica (La Selva and Las Cruces) in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies.  Students will work closely with Costa Rican field assistants and local communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange.  Interested Costa Rican university students will be included in the projects and encouraged to apply for the master's program in environmental management and sustainability at St. Edward's University.  At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and Costa Rican scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences.  An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure to a developing country.  Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods, particularly in tropical forest regions.  

Technical Project Description

Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities.  Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation.  Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.  Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks.  However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached in developing countries, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas.  As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives.  Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations.  Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1. To quantify how policies integrating conservation and development objectives, such as ecotourism, academic research activities, and multiple-use protected areas, influence tropical forests and their primates, as well as how effective these environmental policies are at maintaining human livelihoods.  2. To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in the environmental sciences.  To meet these objectives, student projects will examine differences in forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, carbon storage, diversity) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, population size) across a number of forests at and surrounding Las Cruces and La Selva Biological Stations in Costa Rica that are protected for various objectives (i.e., ecotourism, research, national conservation).  Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how this influences local perception of environmental policy.  Specifically, 15 ten-week independent master's student research projects will occur across a three-year period to survey primate populations, quantify behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays in country (an environmental endocrinology laboratory will be established in Costa Rica), conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, other stakeholders, and tourists, and quantify forest characteristics.  By examining interactions between people, parks, and primates through independent, yet interrelated, student projects, we will be able to provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of private ecotourism, public protected areas, and academic research stations to maintain livelihoods for human populations and promote conservation of biodiversity.  Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic, participatory, and research incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes.  As a breakdown in either natural ecosystems or human society will negatively affect the other, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain both biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually promoting sustainability and conservation."

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site involving the extension of funding for an existing I-Corps Site that was first funded in 2013. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

The Site extensions of the California State University (CSU) Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) for an additional three years builds on experience as an I-Corps Site and grows institutional support for life sciences entrepreneurship education and technology transfer. The activities involved in this renewal aim to smooth the development path for nascent academic entrepreneurs across the CSU. Specifically during Phase II, CSU I-Corps is: recruiting biological sciences researchers and funding 30 Site Teams annually, providing opportunities to discover biotechnology commercialization pathways; building on CSU I-Corps' growing community of life science entrepreneurs, alumni, industry experts and campus-based entrepreneurship resources to offer tailored advice for research-based ventures; and developing a three-part program for nascent biological sciences entrepreneurs to help them escape social and cognitive biases, explore venture ideas, assess technologies to solve problems, and discover commercialization pathways. The I-Corps Biological Sciences Site nurtures CSU researchers so that they gain confidence in their entrepreneurial abilities, greater understanding of biotechnology commercialization pathways, and a better calibration of their concepts maturity level. 

More than a quarter of the CSU STEM baccalaureates are from underrepresented populations - CSU educates more Hispanic, African-American, and American Indian undergraduates than all other institutions in the state combined. The CSU diverse student population is engaged in immersive learning provided by biological sciences research and entrepreneurial activities. Employers and investors value creative students who graduate with demonstrated accomplishments in team-based research, the ability to solve real-world problems, and experience with the unique challenges of biotechnology commercialization. CSU I-Corps gives students and faculty access to mentors, sources of capital, business expertise, and leadership opportunities."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to  monitor  sleep quality of individuals and report sleep quality index and sleep architecture using an ambient connected sensor. This project will potentially improve quality of care in some patient populations such as Alzheimer/Dementia patients and infants by enabling sleep quality assessment using a non-intrusive technology.   The passive sensor we have developed can precisely detect entire sleep stages as well as any abnormalities related to breathing or movement during sleep. The sensor is placed outside of bed and does not pose discomfort to the patient. It is our goal to offer a sleep sensor that will be an essential part of our healthy lifestyle choices.  The sensor must be non-intrusive and ambient to be widely accepted. Wearable or body-contact sensors take away from the natural sensation of sleep and might create a feeling of being monitored. For this reason, we believe an ideal sleep monitor should be ambient and easily blend in with the accessories on the bedside table. This monitor will enable the same kind of diagnostic power available in a hospital, to the comfort of our bedrooms. 

This I-Corps project proposes a sleep monitor based on a passive infrared sensing technology which utilizes a pyroelectric material for temperature sensing.  The material is lithium tantalate, a crystal that has pyroelectric properties. A change in ambient temperature creates a change in polarization of the crystal. This change creates a potential across the crystal and a charge is generated similar to a capacitor.  The generated charge is collected by electrodes thus we obtain the voltage response of the pyroelectric detector.  Under constant and ambient temperature, the response quickly approaches steady state. Due to the thermal time constant, the crystal will quickly thermalize to its environment after input. Thus, we observe a 'voltage pulse' mechanism when there is a fast change (physical movement) against the background. This property makes our sensor very sensitive to fluctuations against the background temperature distribution and allows it to accurately detect fine movements such as chest motion during breathing.  We use these fine chest movements to detect respiration and heart rate which in turn are used to  determine the sleep stage.  We use respiration rate variability to determine sleep stages and derive sleep quality index using sophisticated signal processing methods.

"abstractText": "This project will enable cohorts of students from engineering, anthropology, and other sustainability-related disciplines to collaborate and study the efficacy of sanitation and wastewater treatment technologies as well as the role of culture and local perceptions on the safe recovery of energy, nutrients, and clean water from human excreta and wastewater. Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.

The integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Students will study the removal of emerging contaminants and characterize the risks associated with resource recovery from pilot-scale established and emerging wastewater treatment technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS), which is co-managed by UFMG and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais. Students will also investigate perceived values and risks through ethnographic research with community members and local stakeholders in the water and wastewater sector. The results of this research will support a new and growing field of interdisciplinary scientific literature on the topic of water, culture, and sustainability.

"abstractText": "Technical Description 

With the rise in global population and rapid growth of urban and coastal areas worldwide, providing clean water is a major challenge particularly when basic sanitation needs are not met. Water scarcity, poor sanitation, and economic disparity tend to characterize many densely populated urban areas throughout the world. There is no doubt that new solutions are needed to improve the availability of clean water and basic sanitation for underserved populations. Moreover, solutions that also recover energy and resources for net-zero impact have the potential to lessen the burden for communities dealing with water scarcity, and energy and food security issues.

Consequently, there is a need to improve fundamental knowledge on decentralized wastewater systems technologies (DEWATS) that lead to net-zero energy and resource use. IRES students from San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona will contribute to fundamental research in collaboration with the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) on biological and physico-chemical processes in DEWATS and resource and energy recovery from wastewater. Students will use traditional methods (microbiological techniques, water chemistry and solids analyses) and novel applications of fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the performance of an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with water reuse for agricultural applications. This IRES project aims to be a transformative scientific and cultural experience for US students that will advance fundamental knowledge of ABR and other DEWATS treatment processes implemented at the full-scale in South African communities.

Broader Description

This project is a unique opportunity for environmental engineering undergraduate and graduate students to visit the UKZN in Durban, South Africa, where they will conduct fundamental research on resource and energy recovery from wastewater, new perspectives on wastewater treatment, and sustainable sanitation. Over the course of the three year project, fifteen US students will be supported to work on novel research at the nexus of water, energy, and food with a focus on decentralized wastewater treatment systems in growing urban centers. Students will be mentored by active research faculty at the Pollution Research Group at UKZN and obtain an enriching international experience on topics highly relevant for environmental scientists and engineers.

This research experience will equip upper-level undergraduates with research skills needed to transition to graduate school and strengthen the research and mentoring skills of graduate student participants. The US student cohorts will be recruited from groups, including those underrepresented in environmental science and engineering, at San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona. A pre-departure orientation program is designed to promote team building, cultural sensitivity, and adequate preparation for students to conduct collaborative research internationally. As part of the evaluation of this project and for knowledge transfer from cohort-to-cohort, exit surveys will be conducted and videos of the research and student perceptions will be disseminated to subsequent cohorts. Participants will present their research at UKZN and at local and regional research symposia, professional society meetings, or conferences. IRES participants will conduct outreach for K-12 audiences via after-school programs."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy's technology has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption of electric vehicles and grid/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies, as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports, water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. 

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and 2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade carbon nanotubes.  Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs.

Harassment and abuse plague current social platforms. This abuse is particularly directed towards women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, who are most vulnerable to these types of attacks. These demographics around the world need a harassment-free social network platform to communicate and share content and would be willing to pay a subscription fee. In addition, independent "new media" content creators also need an advertising-free and harassment-free platform to build an audience, interact with followers or fans, control access to paid content, and receive payment for their work. Users who have fled other platforms due to harassment, data mining, or personal privacy concerns may also want friendly and safe spaces to interact and share content. In addition to subscription fees, this novel moderation technology has the potential to be offered as a service to other social network businesses.

This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project takes a novel consent-based approach to social network moderation. The project combines data from multiple sources, including machine learning models, in order to give users more control over the content they wish to see and prevent harassment and abuse. By supplementing automated approaches with human ones, and putting users in control of which sources of moderation content and metadata to trust, this innovation will reduce the labor required for human moderation and the accuracy of machine approaches, all while making relatively strong guarantees that the most vulnerable users will not be exposed to abuse or harassment.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a single beam ion source that enables the manufacturing of high-quality thin film materials and related products. Thin films have a significant impact on quality of life as they are used widely in semiconductor devices, displays, solar panels, tribological coatings, cell phones, optical filters, and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion and has been steadily increasing. Common methods to produce thin films include physical and chemical vapor depositions, which today have tradeoffs between film quality and manufacturability. A high deposition rate results in loosely packed atoms and subsequently unstable materials properties. Producing high-quality dense films today requires slow deposition at elevated temperatures leading to high manufacturing cost and other limitations, such as inability to use flexible substrates. Ion sources are plasma generation devices that enable ion beams to interact with materials at the atomic level and efficiently produce dense films. The single beam ion sources bring in multiple benefits for thin film fabrication, including superior stability, improved adhesion, low electrical resistivity, high optical transmittance, and smooth surfaces.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the technical and commercial feasibilities of the single beam ion sources particularly suitable for fabricating high-quality thin films and devices. In ion beam assisted thin-film deposition, ions simultaneously interact with the atoms as they are deposited from another source. The ions transfer kinetic energies to the surface atoms so that they can move around to form densely packed films. The single beam ion sources proposed in this project can produce a highly focused beam of ions with tunable energy for optimal processing of the growing films. These unique features are enabled by an innovative design of the electromagnetic fields, which efficiently generate plasmas and extract the ions in a narrow beam. Unlike the conventional racetrack type ion sources, the single beam ion sources can accurately control the ion incident angle, which has strong effects on the surface morphology of the deposited film.

If successful, this technology will enable researchers to automate and standardize 3D cell culture techniques in a format that is broadly compatible with current laboratory infrastructure.  It would bridge a gap between commercial biomanufacturing/pharmaceutical development and the academic state-of-the-art.  Moreover, the proposed technology will provide the scientific community with novel tools to perturb and observe how individual cells interact with each other and with their microenvironment.  Probing biological signatures at single-cell resolution underpins major current trends in biomedical research, from clinical applications in cancer therapy, diagnostics, and immunology, to global basic science initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas project.  The goal of this grant is to facilitate commercialization of a single-cell handling instrument for use in research universities and pharmaceutical R&D laboratories.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop an automated instrument for seeding organoids or other 3D tissue cultures with single-cell resolution.  Organoids have the potential to transform personalized medicine and disease modelling, but current culture methods are poorly controlled, leading to wide variability between individual samples and across labs.  It is recognized that standardization, reproducibility, and tight control of cell seeding parameters will be paramount for drawing predictive value from organoids in the clinic, particularly when many statistical replicates are required.  The technology developed is a high-resolution robotic cell printing instrument capable of rapidly and deterministically seeding single cells contained within sub-nanoliter liquid volumes.  The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the proposed cell printing technology to seed organoid cultures with complete control of the type and number of constituent cells in each organoid.  Using Lgr5+ stem cell-derived intestinal organoids as a model culture system, protocols will be developed for preparing "printer-ready" input single stem cells from primary tissue.  Then, the plan is to evaluate the effects of cell seeding state on organoid morphology by varying cell number, cell type and ECM components, to test the hypothesis that controlled seeding will result in improved morphological reproducibility, as assessed by high-content imaging.

Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of livestock agriculture. 

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent) bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which will be further tested in animal studies.

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient's genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn's genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security.  This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata.  Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors."

The worldwide cold-chain freight and logistics industry deals with the storage and transportation of more than 100 million metric tons of fresh produce annually. In this industry, there is currently an urgent need to continuously monitor the air quality in shipping containers where large volumes of perishable food items (fresh fruits and vegetables) are stored. Poor environmental conditions in these containers such as unregulated or high temperatures and low humidity can trigger early ripening of fruits and vegetables, leading to the efflux of specific volatile organic compounds; predominantly ethylene. Due to large volume of produce stored in these containers, if gone unchecked, the environment inside can quickly accumulate high levels of ethylene leading to accelerated ageing and subsequently spoilage. As one can imagine, an appropriate gas sensing technology to continuously monitor ethylene levels would allow adaptive climate control inside the containers, thereby ensuring produce freshness on arrival and preventing billions of dollars in loss and reducing food waste.

This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost ethylene sensing technology using bulk silicon transistor technology (also called CS-FET or chemical sensitive field effect transistor), for mass-deployment in refrigerated containers transporting fresh produce to different parts of the world. This innovation will address an unmet need in the cold-chain logistics industry where continuous monitoring of fruits and vegetables is required to ensure quality and freshness on-arrival. Existing technologies are either too expensive or have poor sensitivity for deployment in large-scale sensing operations. Specifically, Phase I seeks to identify and engineer a sensitive nanoscale catalyst/sensing-layer that will respond to ethylene. To develop the ethylene sensing layers, this effort will pursue the screening of various nanomaterial systems such as ultra-thin layers of noble and transition metals, their composites, sub-oxides, as well as polymeric films using the silicon CS-FET as the backbone technology platform. Additionally, the proposal will also seek to develop a scientific understanding of the interaction mechanism between ethylene and the target sensing layer at both standard ambient conditions as well as conditions prevalent in reefer containers, i.e. low temperature and high humidity.

The central pivot irrigation industry is an essential segment of the agriculture industry and this project aims to deliver a superior wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors and consumers. Agriculture is the largest industry in the world, and developing a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impacts other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries. 

The technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular. The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall, and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to answer the presidential call to "create digital tutors that are as effective as personal tutors." More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative, and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA) practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create significant commercial value within the educational market. 

This project will create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics. The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial, the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work, and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus software in the FA loop)."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field."

Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

Carbon nanotubes are advanced supermaterials that have been at the forefront of technological innovation since their discovery in the early 1990s, but limited commercial success has ensued due to their high cost of production.  Current use of carbon nanotube materials is limited to a few industries capable of absorbing the high cost of research-scale quantities of carbon nanotubes (defense applications, aerospace manufacturers, and research institutions). Achieving scalable, lower-cost carbon nanotube manufacturing processes will enable widespread applications such as: advanced batteries with lower cost, weight, and improved longevity, tires with longer lifetimes and increased fuel efficiency, and coatings enabling enhanced functionality such as in the case of de-icing for aircrafts, spacecraft vehicles, and drones.  The societal impact of this advancement includes better performing and more energy efficient devices for consumers without added cost.  The commercial impact of this technology will enable the significant effort carried out in many market sectors to evaluate and understand the benefit of carbon nanotubes to products, to be economically realized.    


This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel electrochemical liquid-phase growth method for carbon nanotube production, which significantly lowers the cost of production for carbon nanotubes and enables widespread commercial use of the materials.  The largest bottleneck to carbon nanotube utilization today is the high production cost that arises due to numerous factors including low efficiency of chemical processes, high overhead cost for scaling, and formation of toxic by-products that require additional costs.  These limitations have led to high prices for the materials that prohibit their use in cost-sensitive markets, which rely on low-cost additives such as carbon black.  The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility of using a scalable catalyst preparation and deposition technique for the production of carbon nanotubes through low-cost, environmentally-beneficial electrochemical routes.  To achieve this, we will utilize ambient processing for catalyst preparation and a scalable electrochemical reaction chamber that harnesses the precision of electrochemistry, sources the carbon feedstock directly from air, and operates at extremely high energy efficiencies (>90%).  The anticipated technical results include a rapid and scalable growth technique with minimized added cost from catalyst deposition without compromising carbon nanotube quality.

"abstractText": "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel. Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened, it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.
The impact of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions, improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership role in technology to enable these societal changes.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  
Skyven?s system-level innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular: (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without require rework of the existing control systems.

Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.


Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting."

This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed."

This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months."

HLB and canker have cost growers billions of dollars in destroyed trees and are decimating the Florida citrus industry. In Florida, annual citrus production has fallen from 242 million boxes in the 2003-2004 growing season to 45 million boxes in 2017-2018.  Further, citrus canker may be found in 98% of the citrus production regions in Florida. Working with the University of Florida, the goal of this project is to use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to advance natural selection to make citrus trees resistant to both HLB and citrus canker. If successful, this approach could be used to protect the 93 million tons of citrus production worldwide. 

The intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits, protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best performing mutations from Phase I will be combined and used for more extensive greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.

Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II."

In order to overcome the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research and drug development. 

The accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

This project will provide the commercialization training to graduate students and enhance students learning on commercialization skills. As a potential societal impact, this innovation will enhance the quality of life, by using noninvasive breath sensors for the recognition of human blood glucose level for diabetics. New discoveries will be disseminated through presentations, workshops, partnerships, and potential technology transfer to a start-up company. Industrial collaborators from various companies will help translate this innovation into engineering practice. More than 100 people will be outreached about the innovations in the noninvasive diabetes sensors during the interview process.

This I-Corps project is to conduct market analysis and customer interviews for commercializing a noninvasive breath biosensor for detecting acetone in exhaled breath for the recognition of human blood glucose level. The molecular imprinted layer improved the selectivity of the sensors by allowing the specific molecule to be exposed into the sensor. The acetone-imprinted sensor shows a wide range of linear relationship with the growth of the acetone concentrations in the range of 0-10 ppm at a sensitivity about 15 &#8486;/ppm. This sensor has the following advantages over the existing diabetes sensors in the market. This sensor has a linear gas response to acetone from <0.9 ppm to 10 ppm, which leads to accurate detection of acetone concentration in breath of patients with diabetes (usually in the range of 1.7 ppm to 3.7 ppm). This sensor demonstrates high stability, improved selectivity, and high sensitivity for acetone from different gas molecules such as moisture, ethanol, etc. This sensor has a small size that can fit in a pocket. Patients with diabetes can conveniently and discretely carry the sensor for real-time detection of acetone in exhaled breath to recognize human blood glucose level and help determine a patient?s insulin needs.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the implementation of digital pathology by giving pathologists computational guides to help them achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in making their "calls". Currently biopsy diagnosis is a labor-intensive process that relies upon 19th century microscope technology; pathologists are doctors who use microscopes to make diagnoses. Pathologists examine slides from breast biopsies as part of breast cancer screening programs for more than a million women each year in the US.  This is a highly subjective process and there is evidence that even pathologists may disagree with one another, especially with difficult cases. This is potentially large patient safety issue, as some patients may not be optimally triaged.  It is currently possible to digitize the slides as whole slide images (WSIs), but there are very limited options for computer assisted pathologist review and this is a major reason that the digital pathology market has not developed as rapidly as most experts predicted. This project is a major advance as it addresses a large clinical need ? augmenting pathologists in their ability to make efficient and accurate diagnoses; and it also has great commercial potential as a disruptive, must-have application in the early digital pathology marketplace.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue of accuracy and efficiency of pathologist diagnosis in breast core biopsies, and this should validate our approach as an unmet need in the current digital pathology marketplace. There are other groups applying machine learning to pathology, but this project is a unique approach that addresses practical issues related to expert training of the machine, rapidly displaying targeted images to pathologists, and providing a guiding support while keeping the doctors in control. The project will ask pathologists to label WSIs with their diagnoses; this data will be used to train an AI system; and the AI system performance will be studied. Preliminary studies seem to support that a human and AI system working together will be both more efficient and more accurate than a human working alone. If this expanded project validates this, then there is a tremendous commercial opportunity that can also have a positive impact on patients. Not only access to better diagnoses for patients, but also the possibility for any pathologist to perform at a higher level.

Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space."

This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC)."

This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase 1 project will advance technology to significantly improve the standard of care within corrective surgery for spinal deformity. Approximately 55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.  It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.  However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure, and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. 

This project repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in translating medical devices into impactful commercial products. The aims within this project include the development of novel tracking-system augmentation hardware, image-analysis algorithms, optimization of accuracy via benchtop testing, and validation via testing with cadaveric specimens.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.  The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6: Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally, because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive ankle prostheses.  

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint, adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry.


This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is as follows. Commercially, the technology described herein has the capability to provide faster, granular, dynamic information about safety and security, globally, to firms, universities, governments, and NGOs. This project uses novel methods to improve Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. As a result, better geo-parsing of digital sources of news about security will result in risk content that can be aggregated, displayed, and analyzed in original ways. This enables security managers at these organizations to better understand risk and protect their staff, providing a higher quality of care. For non-governmental organizations (including firms), this enables improved decision-making about operations, travel, and investment. For governments, this enables improved physical security resource allocation. Socially, this project has the potential to improve transparency and accountability regarding trends about safety and security, by improving the aggregation and visualization of data. As an example, groups of firms and governments in emerging markets can collectively identify previously unnoticed patterns of insecurity, in support of public accountability. 
 
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is an innovation over the state of the art in the following ways. First, this project builds on current geo-parsing extraction methodologies by adding methodologies unique to the safety and security space. Second, this project uses external data sources for cross correlations to improve the "aboutness" and granularity of extracted reports. Third, this project exploits contributions from users at the organizational level - as well as individuals. That is, this project supports the growth of an ecosystem in which human users of information also contribute to the quality, volume, and timeliness of that information. This contribution is also intended to improve the geo-parsing methodologies via machine learning. The opportunity is the improvement of geo-parsing extraction mechanisms. The research objectives are to test the hypotheses that NLP algorithms can exploit patterns unique to the safety and security space; that external sources of news can be exploited for improved granularity and "aboutness" scores; and that user-generated content can serve to support an ecosystem of information sharing. The anticipated results are that the above innovations will result in usability scoring sufficient for the safety and security use case."

"abstractText": "This project will enable the reproducible analysis and sharing of large human brain imaging datasets.  Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of the human brain, but the processing of large neuroimaging datasets is often a difficult and time-consuming process. This project will improve the ability of researchers to analyze these data more effectively and share the results.  This work will build upon the OpenNeuro project, which provides researchers with the ability to easily upload and share neuroimaging data. The first aim of this project is to develop the ability to process these datasets using national supercomputing resources. Because these resources are both much more powerful and more cost-effective than commercial cloud computing resources, this extension will allow researchers to process larger datasets using more sophisticated analysis procedures.  The second aim is to extend the reach of data storage and processing beyond standard neuroimaging datasets to include heterogeneous datasets with clinical and psychological data in addition to brain imaging data. A large study of human brain development will be used as a test case for this extension. The third aim of this project is to engage researchers and software developers in order to develop a broad community that will further extend the reach and capabilities of the proposed technical developments and promote the sustainability of the resources beyond the grant period.

The first aim will implement the ability to execute computational workflows using national supercomputing resources through a Science-As-A-Service model, via technologies such as the Agave API and the Singularity container system.  This will provide the ability for researchers to execute complex containerized workflows using large datasets, providing a long-term sustainable computational platform for analysis of open data. The second aim will involve the extension of the current OpenNeuro platform to represent data from a large longitudinal neurodevelopmental study, in order to allow the joint analysis of imaging, clinical, psychological, and genetic data.  The third aim will engage the relevant user and developer communities through workshops and code sprints.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently, EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. 

 

The proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science, decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization, feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.

During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.

Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision), medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing a new market for SWIR imaging. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will produce low-cost germanium (Ge)-based shortwave infrared (SWIR) image sensors with features superior to those of currently available SWIR sensors. The research objective is to resolve issues of resolution, power usage, size, and sensitivity that limit advancement in the SWIR imaging field. This project will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure. In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge Modulate Device. Research will focus on refining and improving the fabrication processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image sensors."

Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines."

Touch screens literally allowed access to the virtual world and its capabilities at our fingertips and enabled those who were keyboard illiterates to access the vast world wide web capabilities through this natural interface. A ubiquitous cost effective multipoint touch sensing technology would make a broader impact beyond consumer electronics by improving motor skills and potentially eliminating phantom pain for amputees fitted with neuro prosthetics limbs. As the digital world becomes more connected and continues to permeate our physical world in the form of the mobile Internet of Things, autonomous cars, and other wireless connected smart technologies, it is important to reduce the cost barrier for adoption and ease of interaction between the device and the human. A society that can enable all its members, youngsters to aging elders, to easily interface with connected assistive devices would have increased access to information, education, ecommerce and consequently will see faster economic growth. 
 
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at demonstrating a ubiquitous multipoint touch and force sensing on planar or curved surfaces that are either conducting (metals) or insulators (glass/plastic). Current multipoint touch sensing technologies are limited to transparent, insulating and planar surfaces. These technologies involve patterning multiple layers of semitransparent films on a glass or polyamide substrate then integrated with the display in a complex manufacturing process. The films? semitransparent nature reduces the quality of the display image and requires increasing the display brightness which affects the battery life in mobile devices. The high manufacturing cost reduces deployment and hence limits access to the wider consumer society. This project targets developing a low-cost technology that detects force and location of multi touch points on any surface without film patterning. Successful execution and deployment of the proposed technology would increase deployment of multipoint touch and force sensing in consumer electronics and hence a broader access in the society. New opportunities for utilizing the technology both for scientific investigation as well as for end user value will evaluated for lower limb fitting to reduce phantom pain and in neuro prosthetics as a potential sensory feedback.

Renewable oils, waxes and fatty acids have significant demand in a wide range of industries (e.g. neutraceuticals, biolubricants, cosmetics, candles and soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction of our dependence on petroleum-based products while generating a market for agricultural wastes and by-products. Since few companies and research groups are investigating fungal lipid production directly from lignocellulosic biomass for higher- value products, both industry and the scientific community will benefit from the knowledge gained by this research. 

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes a simple, novel and cost-effective process for converting lignocellulosic and other waste feedstocks to high- value lipids using a microorganism isolated from Yellowstone National Park, which is capable of withstanding extreme acidic conditions and producing powerful enzymes for degrading cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose. The organism accumulates high concentrations of valuable lipids in a cost-effective ?one-step? process. The produced lipids based on renewable resources creates a market for waste agricultural materials. The primary objective of this SBIR project is to further develop the process for commercial production of lipid products from waste organic feedstocks. Phase II efforts will focus on optimizing the process with a bench pilot-scale system, performing process flow design and techno-economic analysis of commercial production systems, analyzing lipid products in detail, and targeting appropriate markets/customers for the produced lipid products. Coming out of the Phase II program, the goal is to have a pilot- level demonstration system designed to produce economically viable yields of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and customers."

This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend."

In general, produced water is contaminated with hydrocarbons, salts, and harmful microorganisms, meaning that it must be treated before it can be discharged or reused for agriculture and other purposes. This is an important environmental, public safety, and economic problem in the US. Research conducted during this project will be used to evaluate reactor improvements including process sensors and control systems, electrode geometries and surface coatings, degradation of contaminants in produced water, field testing, and techno-economic modeling. The anticipated technical results are that the Symbios plasma system will degrade hydrocarbon contaminants and kill microorganisms in frac flowback or produced water, leaving the waters suitable for safe reuse or discharge. 

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will facilitate cleanup and reuse of a critical resource, water, in the oil and gas production industry, with crucial societal benefits for protecting the environment, guarding human safety, and keeping domestic energy costs down. The proposed technology is based on an innovative, low-voltage plasma discharge that creates powerful oxidizing species for destroying biological and chemical contaminants in produced water. Symbios Technologies has developed relationships and executed agreements with key companies in the produced water treatment field, which have identified numerous near-term business opportunities and provided crucial insights into preparing the technology for commercial success during Phase II. The customer-centered emphasis on solving water contamination problems in the oil and gas industry, which was estimated to have a global market size of $45 billion in 2010, will result in a high likelihood for commercial success. The Phase II R&D plan will enhance scientific and technical understanding as well as commercial impact by addressing reactor improvements pertaining to corrosion resistance and automated operation for a market-ready system, treatment of microbial and organic contaminants in produced water, on- site testing, and demonstration of economic competitiveness of the developed system."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a cost-effective, high-performance anticorrosive coating for protecting metal structures, particularly in marine environments. High value assets that are essential parts of the US energy infrastructure, such as offshore oil and gas platforms, marine ships and wind turbines, are exposed to one of the most corrosive environments with direct exposure to salt water via immersion and seawater spray. Corrosion of these metal structures is estimated to cost the world economy around $2.3 trillion in maintenance and replacement capital every year. This project's superhydrophobic coating has the potential to significantly reduce both cost and waste by improving structural safety, reducing maintenance frequency and lengthening the operating lifetime of such vital assets. It will also reduce the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems by using less harmful materials, negating coating repainting needs and extending metal lifetime.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to make a durable, superhydrophobic, high-performance anticorrosive coating through creation of dual-function coating additives. Coatings and corrosion inhibitors are generally the first line of defense in this fight against corrosion. Highly-water repellent superhydrophobic coatings are leading contenders for delivering a step change in corrosion protection performance. However, current solutions suffer from two notable issues: high cost and low durability in highly corrosive marine environments. Existing superhydrophobic coatings require complex and expensive equipment and materials. In addition, these coatings are easily damaged during use, resulting in the loss of their water repellency and corrosion protection ability. The key innovation of this project is a novel dual-function additive that can impart coatings with both superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) and on-demand corrosion inhibitors release (active corrosion protection). This additive based approach results in a durable coating that retains its protective abilities even through significant use and abrasion and enables adaptation to many other coating applications, even ones outside of corrosion.

Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch."

PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development. 

 The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative source of pharmaceutical heparin using engineered cultured mammalian cells. Heparin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant (blood thinner), critical for surgical operations and for patients that otherwise have risks of blood clotting. Over 300,000 doses are administered per year in the US alone. Currently, heparin is prepared from animal tissues, primarily pig intestines in China, which has regulatory agencies in the US and other countries concerned. For one reason, heparin manufacturing is difficult to regulate in China as evidenced by the heparin adulteration crisis in 2008 that led to allergic reactions and over 250 deaths worldwide. In addition, there is concern that the Chinese pig population will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand. The FDA is considering reintroducing heparin produced from beef cattle as an alternative source, however, bovine heparin is still subject to complications involving animal tissues and it has different anticoagulant properties, which complicates dosing. The current proposal develops cell-based production in which the entire supply chain can be under GMP control and scalable as needed with no dependence on the number and health of an animal population.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to genetically engineer cells to produce a heparin product that can be manufactured for pharmaceutical use. Cellular production can be entirely under GMP control, and cell engineering provides opportunities to produce heparin with improved properties. A survey of clinicians that use heparin overwhelmingly identified heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as a serious detrimental side effect. HIT can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart attack and loss of life and limb. Treatment is complicated and expensive. HIT is an allergic reaction caused when heparin binds to a specific protein in the blood called platelet factor 4 (PF4). PF4 binding depends on elements of heparin structure that are not involved in heparin's anticoagulant activities. Through cell engineering, heparin molecules with an altered structure will be produced that have reduced affinities for PF4, while maintaining potent anticoagulant properties. In addition, heparin has demonstrated efficacy in other areas such as inflammation and cancer that are not involved in blood clotting. Through cell engineering, heparin structures also could be tailored for these additional applications.

As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer students' questions.  It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe.  It engages students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex.  Besides school use, the game's independent learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application for many other educational and training requirements.  

The innovation is a unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt) that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures, exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority scientists."

 	This SBIR Phase I project proposes to study a plasma-based fusion device which has two rings that oscillate in the axial and radial directions.  The rings will be confined in an axial harmonic oscillator potential.  The two rings collide with one another axially when both rings have their maximum axial velocities. Fusion occurs primarily from the relative velocities of the rings, not from the thermal energy in the plasma.  This will allow for the use of advanced aneutronic fuels.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.

This project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.

Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

Inhibitors of disease-related proteins are central to modern therapeutics across the spectrum of diseases, from cancer to autoimmune diseases, to viral infections, and even to certain hereditary disorders.  Many of these drivers of disease are transcription factors or signal-transduction molecules, yet these proteins are commonly thought of as "undruggable," due to a lack of small pockets for drug binding or due to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. This proposal is aimed at developing an easily screenable library, consisting of DNA-encoded peptidomimetics, whose members have the necessary properties to inhibit these "yet-to-be-drugged" proteins.  Of highest commercial importance, these compounds could address many of the currently "undruggable" molecular drivers of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to create a DNA-encoded library of constrained peptidomimetic compounds. Current DNA-encoded libraries are primarily limited to small molecules (DNA-encoded chemical libraries; DECLs) or to natural amino acids in the context of translated-protein display (e.g., phage display or mRNA display). In contrast, member molecules of this library will have a much larger binding surface than current small molecules from DECLs, and will be both protease resistant and have a wide range of chemical side chains, unlike the natural peptides from phage display. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize compounds with conformational rigidity along with parallel DNA encoding.  A library of these compounds could be screened to discover new therapeutic candidates (human and veterinary), life sciences research tools, and heat-resistant diagnostic reagents.

While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced."

The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and be made more efficient by using wide bandgap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include but are not limited to power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel contactless, hybrid current sensor offering an order of magnitude better performance than the state-of-the-art in capturing currents up to and beyond 30 MHz for use in emerging high-frequency power converter applications utilizing wide bandgap semiconductors. The proposed sensor combines complementary magnetoresisor and Rogowski coil technology along with magnetic concentrators into a single chip. By combining these previously underexplored technologies in discrete current sensing would result in a non-invasive, lossless current sensor for MHz converters, where today none exists. Phase I objectives will address technical challenges in developing a chip-scale integrated sensor, including miniaturized Rogowski coil design and magnetic concentrator shape and material evaluation for signal amplification and electromagnetic interference rejection. Design of the analog signal conditioning circuits required for the integrated circuits are also part of this phase.

Replacement of volatile, flammable liquid electrolytes now used in lithium ion batteries with safe solid electrolytes is the goal of many existing and future battery technologies. The development of such a solid electrolyte separator has broad applications in many economic sectors and to companies developing lithium ion, lithium metal, lithium sulfur (LiS) and lithium air batteries. The technology can be applicable to many lithium ion conducting ceramics, protecting them from contact with lithium metal and water, and enabling them to be bonded with polymer electrolytes, so that composites can be formed that are processible and compatible with existing manufacturing processes or technologies to make batteries.

This I-Corps project addresses several critical problems that hinder the development of all solid state lithium batteries. It is a technology that merges the beneficial characteristics of both lithium ion conducting ceramics and organic polymer electrolytes. Lithium ion conducting ceramics can have high conductivity, wide electrochemical stability windows and moduli that in principle suppress the growth of dendrites, but are brittle and not easily incorporated into full cells. Polymer electrolytes have good processibility, can be easily incorporated into battery cells and have better compatibility with electrodes, but have low ionic conductivity. The technology merges these two materials using silica "glue" that adheres well to the ceramic and can be functionalized to be compatible with the polymer component. This has been demonstrated using the sandwich geometry of polymer/ceramic/polymer, showing that there is low interfacial resistance between the two components. When nanometer layers are applied to ceramic particles, composites with polymers or polymer gels can be formed with the desirable properties of both components.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 allocated over $4 billion to deployment of new technology for grid monitoring, control and infrastructure protection.  This led to a dramatic proliferation in the use of Big Data across multiple operational domains such as generation, transmission and distribution, customers, services, and markets. A challenging goal is to convert Big Data in smart grids, which is overwhelmingly abundant and yet grossly underutilized, into new knowledge that can offer major improvements in the above mentioned domains of smart grid operation, including management of almost a trillion dollars in grid infrastructure annually and an increase in building energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020. The Smart Grids BD (SGBD) Spoke will build an action-oriented organization focused on developing the fundamental framework for BD integration and knowledge extraction for power system applications. This will enable the South Big Data Hub to meet the societal grand challenge of creating technological solutions that can fulfill the economic potential inherent in Big Data analytics in the electric utility industry, expected to reach an annual value of close to $4 billion by 2020. The Project mission is to complement, strengthen, and serve the South Hub regional priority areas. Moreover, the services of the Spoke will benefit and complement the other Hub regional priority areas dependent on a smart grid backbone for operational assurance and resilience, specifically the areas of Oil and Gas Production and Distribution, National Hazards (Coastal and Other Hazards), Materials and Manufacturing, Habitat Planning (Smart and Connected Communities, Transportation, Urban Infrastructure and Sustainability) and Education and Training.  

The significance of Smart Grids Big Data is in the diversity of its sources, growth rate, and spatiotemporal characteristics. Developing a fundamental framework for Big Data integration and knowledge extraction is a grand challenge since the science and technology are yet to be discovered and the theoretical framework established. The main objective is to create an organization that brings together a cross disciplinary capability from academia, industry, and government, thereby (a) bringing  talent and resources from diverse Big Data areas to create an open access Big Data infrastructure that enables collaboration and innovation; (b) engaging industry to define its challenges and implement new Big Data technologies for cost-effective computational, analytical, and data management solutions needed to get the full benefits of smart grids; and (c) establishing close collaboration with the South Hub to find the most effective way to develop outreach, education, and training, thereby assuring the SGBD SPOKE domain integrates synergistically with the other Hub domains to advance fundamental data science and its impacts.   Achieving the knowledge extraction from Smart Grids Big Data will result in the advancement of fundamental sciences in multiple disciplinary domains related to Big Data analytics. It will also increase our understanding of merged data collected from the physical systems, thereby helping us better understand the flow of energy in the smart grids, and how this understanding can prevent emergencies, improve asset management, and increase energy efficiency. It will also provide a more illuminated understanding of behavioral analytics that addresses the human interface with smart electricity systems. The expected transformational outcomes are: (a) solutions to decreasing the grid outages, improving energy and market efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and engaging industry and customers in new business models to ensure industry growth, operational resiliency, and customer value, (b) a cross cutting research community focused on solving practical problems while concurrently advancing the fundamental understanding of Big Data issues; and (c)  engaging  novel instructional paradigms for educating and training the next generation of Big Data experts  nationally and globally."

"abstractText": "This project at Tennessee Tech University (TTU) creates an I-Corps Site.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The objective of the TTU I-Corps Site is to strengthen the innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurial community in the TN region through the delivery of the I-Corps curriculum and support to 30+ teams per year. This activity will leverage existing partnerships between Tennessee Technological University (TTU), ORNL and the Biz Foundry to accelerate commercialization through training, enhanced education, and support of innovative research, while capitalizing on the existing university research infrastructure and the Launch Tennessee (LaunchTN) accelerator network. The TTU Site builds on the existing research experience at TTU by adding specific commercialization training and experience for teams that are composed of various combinations of students, faculty, members of industry and scientists. The TTU I-Corps Site expands the innovation and technical commercialization infrastructure at TTU by:
     1) Building skill sets among students, faculty, engineers and community startups, and
     2) Moving technology from academia, government, and industry toward commercialization. 
This project achieves the goals of the Innovation Corps Sites Program by facilitating the translation of research, encouraging collaboration between academia and industry, and training students to understand innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E). This funding allows TTU to support teams whose projects are likely candidates for commercialization.

The innovation Site at TTU is built around the national I-Corps model, and its focused training experience, and consists of three stages to recruit, immerse and support technical entrepreneurs in the innovation and entrepreneurship lifecycle. The stages are:
     1) Team origination and recruitment 
     2) Formal I-Corps training
     3) Post-training support
These stages are designed to improve the pathway to successful commercialization and develop the participants as better innovators and contributors to the NSF I-Corps network. 

Tennessee (TN) state entrepreneurial startups, as exemplified by SBIR/STTR funding, fall in the 3rd quartile ranking with a 37% decrease in the past two decades. Until recently, most TN entrepreneurs have had limited or no access to training or opportunities to grow their startup. The TTU Site participates in and contributes to the broader knowledge of entrepreneurship research and its impact on engineering education and adds to the database of innovators in the NSF I-Corps network. In particular, this Site aids in understanding the role of entrepreneurship and innovation engineering education and its potential impact on: critical thinking; the network of emerging entrepreneurs and mentors; and, the addition of business students into the I-Corps model. The Site will investigate the early implementation of a quantitative, nationalized assessment model, based on the existing Critical Thinking Assessment (CAT) tool, appropriate for the I-Corps model that could be extended to train the larger innovation community."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

"abstractText": "The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project involves exploring the commercial potential of cutting tool wear monitoring sensors. Cutting tool manufacturers, machine tool manufacturers, and CNC machine operating companies can potentially benefit through improved cutting tool production processes and saving tooling time needed for production. There is a potential growing industrial customer need to accurately, precisely, and inexpensively sense and diagnose cutting tool wear, damage, and/or cutting edge quality. However, there are few reliable instruments available in the market with the required accuracy, resolution, cost, and on-machine usage. The proposed sensor allows for high-resolution monitoring and diagnosis of edge quality by providing quantitative information on morphological properties, including tool edge quality and wear related to abrasion, attrition, and chipping.

This I-Corps project bridges a knowledge gap existing between the state-of-the-art instrumentation technologies and cutting tool inspection methods. Existing methods do not typically provide a quantitative measure to monitor the health of precision cutting tools in a convenient and time/cost-effective manner. The knife-edge interferometer developed in this project allows for precision cutting tool wear measurement and monitoring by providing quantitative information on morphological properties including abrasion, attrition, and chipping. This project enables a new cutting tool wear monitoring paradigm, producing new knowledge in instrumentation and characterization. This research will create a new transformative wear diagnosis principle for precision cutting tools to improve manufacturing reliability and the automation process.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will enable artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) solutions to be implemented in embedded and remote devices. It provides the means to make any camera, remote sensor, or detector truly intelligent and capable of discernment and prediction; any device that has already been electronically equipped will have the potential to utilize decision making intellect. It will be a catalyst in making AI/ML truly ubiquitous and a commodity of the human experience. Intelligent sensors will help make the world safer, cameras will be able to detect anomalies and alert authorities before tragedies, and detectors will be able to predict emergencies instead of simply telemetering data. Economically, through human assistance, embedded AI/ML will enable society to be more efficient and produce greater yield.  This has the potential to be a transformative technology that impacts multiple levels of society.

This I-Corps project further develops an implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) directly as a hardware circuit. AI/ML have revolutionized several technical industries such as voice recognition, image processing, healthcare, and personalized advertisements. AI/ML operates by training a mathematical model, often a combination of non-linear functions, to make inferences about the model's environment. However, AI/ML has been primarily restricted to cloud-based applications with large quantities of computing resources. In contrast, this technology implements the AI/ML model as hardware circuit that fits within a single integrated circuit. This project builds off previous technical accomplishments that implemented software design principles, such as extensibility, service-oriented architecture, modularity, and loose coupling, in hardware design through software assisted compilation. Creating a software aid to automatically restructure the hardware design enabled the hardware to change much more dynamically according to a series of parameters. By applying similar techniques to AI/ML, the technology will be able deconstruct and analyze the AI/ML model, and through a series of algorithms construct a matching hardware circuit.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its promise to positively affect not only consumers, but also enhance efficiencies in the electric energy marketplace as a whole. The basic functionality of matching users to optimal electric plans will result in both higher consumer satisfaction, and result in Retail Electric Providers (REPs) offering more competitive rate packages.  Identifying the actual usage profile of appliances over time and providing actionable information to consumers will enable consumers to take informed decisions on appliance purchases, as well as manufacturers to optimize designs with real-world inputs.   The platform will enable the solution of system-wide problems faced by utility companies like peak period demand surges to be countered through demand response initiatives such as incentivizing customers to modify their usage patterns to smoothen the load curve.  Each function of the proposed system is geared toward addressing a specific source of friction in the electric energy marketplace, and consequently also possesses commercial potential.  Thus, the overall economic impact will be on consumers, REPs, utility companies and appliance manufactures, while promoting a greater knowledge and engagement among the electricity consumers.

This I-Corps project explores the value of creating a bundled energy management system aimed at residential users.  The system uses machine-learning-based analytics of the customer's daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal energy usage trends to offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) incentivizing customers to enable full integration with smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance, and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans. A smartphone app available for the iOS and Android platforms forms the customer interface to the system.  The key novelties of this project lie in the development and integration of machine learning tools and behavioral economics ideas into the domain of residential energy management.  The project is founded on research into the design, development and validation of such tools in contexts such as predicting residential energy usage over time, disaggregating usage on a per-appliance basis, and experimentation on how best to motivate users to engage in energy usage behavior that induces efficient grid operation.

The vision of this project is that communities occupying low-lying coastal areas of the southern US will be protected and develop in a sustainable manner through planning based on knowledge, conservation, and wise use of sensitive lands. Researchers from the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science and the School of Geosciences, Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, and Google Earth Engine are collaborating with the South Big Data Hub through this project to develop more accurate, ultra-high resolution topographic, land cover, and urban environment geospatial products. The project examines in detail areas that were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, and identifies flood-prone areas across the region. The 3D maps show habitat diversity, needed to plan for conservation and development in these important ecosystems.

This project will develop the improved topographic and land cover maps of the south States within 50 Km of the coast from Texas to Florida (an area >220,000 square Km). The maps will be constructed using a Big Data approach, using detailed historical airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data collected from airplanes merged with high spatial resolution (<2 m pixel) multispectral commercial satellite imagery. The project will also include research into detailed 3D mapping of urban areas using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods; specifically the project will map portions of Houston/Corpus Christi in Texas, and Tampa/Saint Petersburg in Florida, using Kite Photography and light aircraft. The production of land cover maps and digital elevation models requires the fusion of very large amounts of disparate data and efficient, automated techniques. The project will develop the strategies to aggregate these data into useful products using Google Earth Engine and a High Performance Computing cluster. The project will distribute all products openly via NOAA's Digital Coastal portal.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to integrate novel and established wearable physiological sensors, machine learning and an adaptable exercise-training algorithm to optimize performance and minimize risk of injury or overtraining. Professional and collegiate teams face significant problems due to injuries, overexertion (rhabdomyolysis) and exertional heat illness (EHI).  Nearly half of these issues are avoidable via proper management and training. In elite athletes, achieving the balance of over or undertraining remains difficult and elusive. Elite and professional athletes, and their coaches, sports scientists, and elite team trainers require the most precise assessment and management of training and performance and the cost of failure is much greater. With success in this population, this innovation can potentially be adaptable to fitness and wellness applications where precision is less important, and efficiency and motivation is more highly valued. For chronic disease management applications, precision, physiological monitoring, instant feedback, and exercise progression become vitally important.

This I-Corps project seeks to enable real-time and continuous monitoring of physiological responses to exercise training using a custom sensor array, adaptable speed-endurance training algorithm and integrated machine learning to create an optimal, individualized exercise-training program for peak performance and minimize injury in elite and professional athletes. Currently, the primary way in which athletes manage this lacks integration and individualization of physiological data to workload in order to prevent overtraining during the exercise session.  To date, there have been few standardized and progressive non-steady state training programs that can adjust a program to a specific individual. Using real-time novel and established physiological sensors with machine learning, the training algorithm has the capability to adapt a workout to an individual's specific physiological responses. A novel sensor developed for this project has proven effective in preliminary testing.

Many key mechanisms of the human body are in part control by the microbes that live in our gut. The way that we currently view, diagnose, and treat many diseases is fundamentally changing with this knowledge. While dozens of diseases are now intrinsically tied with dysbiosis in the gut, of which 1000s of species of microbes reside, we currently have few probiotics as treatment despite the fact that the number of human clinical trials on probiotics in the past 10 years has increased 20-fold. When developed, this technology can potentially be applied to supplements and drugs to help counter noncompliance, and therefore have a significant commercial impact in other fields as well. This is, in addition, to the broad reaching impact on helping individuals with gut problems, which is estimated to be over 50 million. This product also provides an irritant free alternative for those desiring a regular probiotic.

This I-Corps project surrounds the bacteria, Paenibacillus 79-R4 (Pb 79-R4), which has been isolated and characterized.  In vitro trials show very encouraging results that indicated that this strain drastically reduces enteric methane and hydrogen production, which could be transferred to a commercial product.  Pb 79-R4 eliminates the gases that are positively correlated with gut problems in humans- in animal models the supplemental-Pb strain decreased methane-producing activity by over 50%. This technology will also include a prebiotic and a novel beverage-based interactive mode of delivery, which will work in synergy with the bacteria and lets the user know it is working allowing the effects of the probiotic to work faster and decrease the abandonment period in first-time users. In addition, results from in vitro simulations have resulted in significant reductions in certain pathogens."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to prevent and treat obesity and its related diseases using adipose stromal stem cell (ASC)-targeted nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery technology. Obesity is a major public health problem in the US and worldwide. More than one third of US adults are obese, and more than two thirds are either overweight or obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for developing heart disease, stroke, diabetes, fatty liver diseases and other metabolic disorders. The estimated yearly medical care costs of obesity are more than $145 billion in the US. Currently available anti-obesity medical therapies have many severe issues, hence, better approaches to combat obesity are greatly needed. The ASC-targeted NP-based delivery technology is to deliver bioactive agents/drugs to ASCs in subcutaneous adipose tissue, inducing excessive glucose and fat burn off, thus combating obesity and its related complications with high efficacy and minimum side effects.  Our technology can improve human health and the quality of life while dramatically reducing medical care costs, ultimately lessening the negative societal and economic impact of obesity. In addition, a doctoral student will gain intensive and rigorous training and experience in innovation and entrepreneurship. 

This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of a technology involving the use of ASC-targeted NP-based device for the prevention and treatment of obesity with high efficacy and low side effects. ASCs are stem cells found in the adipose tissues. ASCs can be differentiated into many different types of cells that aid in tissue repair, regenerative medicine, obesity and other disease therapy. We aim to induce ASCs differentiation into beige adipocytes in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue for combating obesity. Different from fat-storage white adipocytes, beige adipocytes burn excessive fat and glucose. ASC-targeted NP-based device can deliver bioactive agents/drugs to subcutaneous ASCs and subsequently induce them differentiation into beige adipocytes, resulting in body weight and fat loss and improved metabolic health. This local (transdermal device) and targeted (ASC-targeted NPs) delivery technology bypasses the liver and other tissues, thus minimizing administration frequency, enhancing compliance, and most importantly, maximizing overall treatment efficacy while decreasing side effects. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunity of the FatBurningNanoTM technology and help establish product-market fit through upcoming customer interviews. The feedback from these activities will facilitate product development, and its ultimate commercialization.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be found in civil engineering infrastructure development projects where construction is undertaken in areas affected by expansive soils, i.e. soils that shrink and swell in response to changes soil moisture level.  Such shrink/swell activity in foundation soils is a leading cause of structural damage to roadways and other infrastructure systems built upon them. In the United States Texas, Colorado, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota are among the states with major problems due to presence of expansive soil. Expansive soils have reportedly caused problems in other parts of the world as well. Traditionally, lime and Portland cement have been used to stabilize such expansive soils. However, these traditional stabilizers cannot be used in all soil conditions. In such situations, the only viable solution is to remove the native soil and replace it with better quality materials. The proposed I-Corps technology involves a sustainable soil stabilizer that overcomes many of the limitations found in the traditional stabilizers.  It provides a more economical alternative in projects where remove-and-replace strategy is currently used.  

This I-Corps project explores opportunities for commercialization of a novel soil stabilizer which uses an inorganic compound known as geopolymer as the key ingredient. Geopolymers are synthesized using abundantly available natural materials and/or industrial by-products such as fly ash and ground blast furnace slag. Unlike traditional soil stabilizers (viz. hydrated lime and Portland cement) which require vast amounts of energy during production, geopolymers are synthesized at or near ambient temperatures. Accordingly, the new stabilizer represents a more sustainable alternative to traditional soil stabilizers.  Extensive laboratory testing and microstructural studies conducted during the product development phase demonstrate that the new stabilizer can achieve more than 90% reduction in shrink/swell potential.  The experimental data also confirm that the geopolymer-based stabilizer can be used effectively to overcome a number of significant limitations that exist in the traditional stabilizers, such as inability to treat sulfate-bearing soils. Traditional lime stabilization requires a waiting period of 4-7 days for the stabilizing reactions to take place; this causes interruption in work flow and delay in construction.  In such situations, the new stabilizer can be used to treat the native soil and improve its engineering properties and thus eliminate need for expensive remove-and-replace operations.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enhance wind farm output by increasing the annual energy production through advanced turbine wake-control technologies. This will further enhance the benefits of wind energy and provide guidance in overcoming its challenges. According to the DOE's Wind Vision Report, wind power can be a cost-effective renewable energy source. At the land-based utility-scale, wind is one of the lowest-priced energy sources available today. It has employed 100,000 workers in 2016 and by 2050 it is expected to employ 600,000 workers. Furthermore, researchers estimate that wind power generation in 2013 reduced power-sector water consumption by 36.5 billion gallons. It has reduced the direct power sector carbon dioxide emission by 115 million metric tons, sulfur dioxide emission by 157,000 metric tons, and nitrogen oxides by 97,000 metric tons in 2013 alone. Searching the product-market fit will improve the possibility of incorporating wake-control technologies in the marketplace. Additional applications of this technology can be found in naval defense, where submarine wakes should be concealed, as well as airline traffic control, where airplane wakes need to be dispersed rapidly. 

This I-Corps project technology utilizes instantaneous wake location as a feedback input to a closed-loop control algorithm that manipulates available turbine parameters (such as pitch, speed, and power control) to steer the wake to a desired location. Individual wind turbine wake is a fundamental building block of the complex flow structure in a wind farm. It has been observed that an upwind turbine wake reduces downwind turbine power generation by 40%. As a result, wake control or manipulation provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve wind farm output as a whole, in contrast to the limited benefits of improving individual turbine efficiency. Texas Tech University's wake control algorithm can be incorporated in existing wind farms and can function by altering existing control parameters. This technology has been tested at the wind-tunnel based Hyper Accelerated Wake Kinematics Simulation (HAWKS) platform. The HAWKS platform is capable of emulating full-scale wake detection and steering. Such wake steering would potentially increase power generated by downwind turbines, increasing wind farm power generation as a whole. This increase in power generation increases revenue potential, especially in a grid-price bidding scenario for a low wind speed forecast.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the development of smartphone-based eye disease detection technology for potential clients and partners. Potential commercial clients for the technology include 1) ophthalmologists and eye clinics, 2) medical centers, 3) customers living in rural or suburban areas with limited medical services, 4) senior living and retirement communities, 5) health insurance companies, and 6) ophthalmic instrument manufacturers. Eye diseases are usually detected in clinics with ophthalmic devices, e.g. optical coherence tomography, corneal topography and slit lamp, which are large, expensive and not portable, and need to be operated by trained technicians. However, our proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection method is small, affordable, portable, and it can be operated by patients in a convenient way, which will overcome the limitations mentioned above. The proposed algorithm can detect eye diseases or monitor eye healthiness in a proper and timely manner, and it can share the monitoring information with ophthalmologists. Hence, eye diseases can be detected in the earlier stage with our technology.  Moreover, ophthalmologist can focus more on severe treatments or surgeries. A 5- to 10-fold lower cost is an added potential benefit. 

This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a new eye disease detection technology using a smartphone and make it broadly available for scientific discovery and medical applications. The project further develops a smartphone-based eye disease detection technology that is more accurate and convenient using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection technology makes use of panoramic images or short video recordings of the eye at different angles. The recorded eye images are divided into iris, lens, sclera, and cornea components using automatic image cropping techniques. Each divided component is then analyzed using shape detection and color matching techniques to recognize the shape and to detect the abnormality of each component, respectively. Preliminary finding shows that the proposed technology detects keratoconus with more than 90% accuracy from 30 subjects. To detect diverse types of eye diseases and to increase the accuracy of eye disease detection, we will collect additional eye data from patients and normal subjects to form a larger database, and apply machine learning techniques to the accumulated database. Bringing these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve discovery output in academia and industry.

The highlands were returned to indigenous (Kadazan) persons in Malaysian Borneo following two clear-cuttings over the last century; and the agroforestry system is designed to restore the forest canopy. Eleven undergraduate and two Master of Science students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines will collect data in paid 8-week summer ecological field research experiences. Data include soil properties (organic matter, chemical content, pH, water holding capacity, fungi to bacteria ratio), arthropod diversity (beetles, ants and butterflies) and fructivorous and insectivorous bat communities. 

The data record ecological changes at producer sites and will be compared to sites at the same elevation in an adjacent and protected national forest range for ecological benchmarking.  Benchmarking serves to help qualify agroforestry practices for international green product labelling, which would substantially elevate producer incomes. Results will improve scientific understanding of the linkages among ecological communities in tropical forests from soil to canopy; and, finally, students will gain professional experience in designing ecological field experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and communicating results to stakeholders from different cultures and academics at professional conferences."

"abstractText": "This innovation demonstrates how advanced algorithm information technologies can transform the medical care delivery system by shifting the focus to early diagnosis. This technology identifies suspicious skin lesions as positive or negative for the structural properties of Buruli ulcers. Furthermore, this technique validates the classification system for other skin lesions which can be improved and expanded to include other types of skin diseases for humans, animals, and also plants. Point-of-care diagnostics for skin diseases have the potential to not only identify diseases in the early stages, but also create opportunities to initiate medical interventions in earlier stages of a disease, thereby reducing medical costs by treating diseases with antibiotic therapy instead of surgical interventions and eliminating any unnecessary pain and suffering resulting from complications of late-stage disease diagnosis. This innovation is critical for differential diagnosis, disease surveillance, collecting environmental contextual data, medication adherence, and advancing health literacy. This work is important because it contributes to a wider body of knowledge that seeks to validate algorithm development for point-of-care diagnostics, and ultimately improves access to healthcare for rural and hard-to-reach populations, also reducing barriers to care for otherwise stigmatizing and debilitating diseases.

Advancements in point-of-care diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases, and neglected infections of poverty represents an opportunity to decrease both the incidence and prevalence of debilitating and disfiguring diseases. These otherwise preventable diseases represent the most disability-adjusted life years lost. Representative of an interdisciplinary intervention, image diagnostics for skin diseases require the development of effective means for intervention design, management, and evaluation while enhancing the relationships and collaborations working internationally, across cultures, with community-based primary care, and to also include opportunities for incorporating telehealth to address access to care in resource-limited and hard-to-reach communities. Opportunities to more widely disseminate this research, and to include commercial potential expands the scope of this innovation and provides additional education and training opportunities for students of engineering and public health, but also for clinicians, and community-based healthcare providers. Successful implementation of point-of-care diagnostics for early stage disease detection advances the disciplines and allows for the translation of the innovation, analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of research for future education and training. Lastly, the advancement of this type of innovation has the ability to shift the medical system to early diagnosis reducing the overall disease burden of ill-health and disability due to late stage diagnosis of disease.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable continuous sensing applications in a wide range of energy-constrained sensor-enabled devices. Without dramatic innovations in the development of ultralow power sensory processing, continuous and accurate sensing will remain a niche application limited to environments with a stable and plentiful power source and significant computing resources. The technology described in this proposal will demonstrate the viability and potential widespread deployment of continuous sensing devices in mobile or remote environments with strict energy constraints. An important immediate market for the proposed technology with significant customer base is the smartphone and wearables market, where many new and emerging end user applications could leverage environmental sensing to trigger context-based and anticipatory actions. The proposed technology is broadly applicable to a number of other markets and domains, including medical, health, and safety monitoring of critical patient sensors, personal fitness devices, military applications, and environmental monitors. The ability to flexibly deploy continuous sensing for these and other applications has the potential to revolutionize these markets and create entirely new and unforeseen application domains. 
	
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 2 Project plans to research and develop algorithms based on the properties of biological spiking neurons and the sensory processing capabilities of the human brain. The human brain is truly unique in its ability to use a basic computational element, the spiking neuron, and perform a broad variety of tasks. The brain has the ability to accurately classify sensory patterns from multiple modalities (touch, sight, etc.), to interpret the outside world, and to recognize the current context. A key intellectual merit of this project is a demonstration of how these novel neural algorithms can perform accurate, robust, and low power sensory analysis across multiple sensory domains. Just as the brain is capable of processing data from very different sensors. Researching and developing these neural algorithms will provide insight as to how the human brain learns to recognize important sensory information, how it is able to integrate information from such different sense modalities, and how it is able to perform complex analysis so efficiently."

"abstractText": "The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity, increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy. Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites. This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing equally fast, if not faster. 

This project will solve a problem that has plagued the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production. In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.

"abstractText": "The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

Furthermore, these contaminants continue to accumulate.  Current water bottlers and home filtration systems do not typically remove these chemicals, and the approaches that do sufficiently purify water are expensive and generate large volumes of polluted water as a by-product.  There is a significant opportunity for safe, inexpensive, and easily used method to purify water.  The innovation is expected to be eventually developed as inexpensive, reusable water filters for home, civic, and commercial use.  

This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercialization potential of materials developed in the lab that specifically bind and remove pharmaceutical and herbicide contaminants from water.  The material has a unique ability to be functionalized with active proteins by gene fusion, without compromising either materials assembly or the activity of the added protein.  These functionalized protein-based materials can specifically remove bioactive contaminants and pharmaceuticals from water.   By adding new ligand binding proteins to these materials, the filters developed in this work can be readily adapted to bind a wide variety of chemicals and even toxins with very high affinity and specificity."

The UTRGV-CIC is a center within the UTRGV Vackar College of Business and Entrepreneurship (VCOBE). The UTRGV- CIC was developed in order to accelerate the commercialization of student, faculty and regional innovations into the marketplace, foster and facilitate the exchange of ideas between the university and industry and prepare students to become entrepreneurs. This I-Corps Sites project: 
1. Supports and expands an entrepreneurial culture in a region where entrepreneurs historically have not had significant assistance; 
2. Expands opportunities for undergraduate and graduate business and STEM students so that they are able obtain hands-on experience in the implementation of product validation activities and to engage in real-world STEM-related business projects; 
3. Assists STEM faculty to become more comfortable with the practice of marketing their inventions by introducing them to the I-Corps theory and practice of the I-Corps methodology; 
4. Integrates the I-Corps methodology throughout the UTRGV infrastructure so that the university will be able to carry out its mission of "transforming Texas and the nation through the commercialization of university discoveries".

There are several advantages to having an I-Corps site at UTRGV: being located directly on the U-S.-Mexican border, the UTRGV I-Corps is unique in that it the site is both binational and bicultural; and, the region that UTRGV serves is one of the fastest growing yet impoverished areas in the country. Promoting support for entrepreneurship in such a region demonstrates how well the I-Corps methodology works in a historically underserved area of the country.

This project advances the commercialization of ideas that come from the STEM colleges and departments within UTRGV by providing STEM faculty and students with a methodology to promote their products and ideas in the marketplace. It also broadens the participation of normally underrepresented Hispanic students in the commercialization process. Ultimately, it will benefit the regional economy of deep-south Texas by providing support for start-up businesses and it will enhance the research enterprise at UTRGV through the creation of interdisciplinary teams."

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes."

"abstractText": "This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is that the palladium on hierarchically porous monolithic carbon catalyst being developed promises longer lifetimes and higher performance to industrial chemical companies. This more active, more selective catalyst can lower the operating temperature in chemical reactions thereby decreasing energy usage and giving products with fewer impurities, requiring a smaller number of purification steps and producing less waste. Success will therefore impact both ecological and commercial sustainability in the chemical industry.  

The objectives of this Phase II research project are 1) demonstrate that the carbon support is scalable while maintaining the mechanical properties needed for industrial use, 2) scale loading the palladium catalyst onto the support, 3) exhibit the same high catalytic performance as the laboratory prepared catalyst, and 4) enter full scale production while setting up a quality system. The catalyst to be produced at large quantities represents the first of a new class of hierarchically porous catalyst supports and so further validation of this new product will provide the foundation for introduction of a broad class of catalysts with these superior properties. If successful, full scale manufacturing of this new class of catalysts will be pursued."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the restoration of trust in computing systems.  Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security.  The usual set of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the problem.  This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering the costs of keeping systems secure.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on existing computer infrastructure.  TrustGuard is based on a small, separately manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that serves as the root of trust.  The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities.  The containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws (known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system, firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code)."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Agriculture is one of the most important industries impacting the economy, society, and the environment. By automating harvesting of fresh produce, society's ability to grow healthy and sustainable food will increase substantially. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how to deploy commercially viable multi-robot coordinated groups performing complex automated tasks, in agriculture and beyond. The long-term opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150B+. This innovation focuses on controlled-environment methods, which are more intensive in terms of capital and labor, but far less intensive in terms of water, chemical use, and fertilizer use. If robots can reduce manual labor of large-scale production, and enhance human management precision, it will enable intensive agriculture practices to compete with, and in some cases supplant, traditional chemical-, labor-, and water-intensive approaches. This will make the US a more competitive global producer of high-quality produce, increase food security, increase access to healthy food for all people, and protect natural resources and the environment.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the fields of Robotic Applications, including computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls, by solving critical problems faced when operating in highly dynamic yet precise biological environments like farms. 1) By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will improve environment sensing of e.g. clusters of fruit, their locations, conditions, precise locations of stems and obstacles. 2) Using that information, the project will develop innovative approaches to complex planning problems where leaves, stems, and obstacles interfere with optimal harvesting but are movable. This will be done with millimeter-level precision, where current autonomous planning approaches operate on multi-centimeter precision. 3) Lastly, the project will combine environmental data with 3D reconstructions of grow operations and individual fruit tracking in order to provide better sampling data to forecast production on a 1-4-week basis, and eventually build a deep learning model. This project is critical to achieving the commercial threshold of performance for robotic harvesting services, including high percent of berries picked, acceptable speed of picking, and the provision of climate sensing and forecast information.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments, 6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today, this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology, an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry and diagnostics.  

This Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.  Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.  Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2 ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to
analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a microfluidic instrument as a clinical tool for measuring a new single-cell biophysical biomarker; mass accumulation rate (MAR). Successful completion of the proposed project will constitute the foundation of a medical instrument that will improve treatment strategies for cancer patients. Assigning the optimal therapy for individual patients is particularly important for the treatment of cancer, since every individual's cancer is unique. Although genetic profiling of tumor cells has been the gold standard for personalized medicine approaches in cancer, recent results demonstrate that only a small percentage of patients actually benefit from therapies specifically assigned for them. Aside from few cancer types, where drastic patient responses can be observed using genetic profiling, most cancer patients continue to suffer from ineffective or sub-optimal therapies, which in one of the main drivers of the cost of cancer treatment in the US. This stands in stark contrast to personalized medicine in infectious diseases, where almost all patients are prescribed optimal treatments determined by functional assays based on monitoring the proliferation of microbes ex vivo under the influence of a panel of drugs. Unfortunately, no proliferation-based test for cancer has proven to be sufficiently reliable to be widely adopted for clinical use, mostly because unlike bacteria most cancer cells quickly die when removed from the human body. This SBIR Phase I project will develop the techniques to measure MAR of cancer cells as a metric for drug response. MAR response reflects how individual cells change their growth in response to drugs in very short timescales without the long-term effects of ex vivo culturing. The research that will be conducted in this project will prove the technical feasibility of measuring MAR in a clinical setting for a panel of treatment options. Outcomes of this project will directly enable clinical studies to be conducted, before ultimately seeking FDA approval through clinical trials. 

The focus of this project is a new technology known as the serial Suspended Microchannel Resonator (sSMR), which can measure mass and mass accumulation rates (MAR) of single cells with extreme precision. This SBIR Phase I project will test the technical feasibility of the sSMR platform for measuring drug susceptibility of primary tumor samples with a clinically and commercially relevant speed, versatility and robustness. The company aims to develop sSMR as a platform and introduce MAR as biophysical biomarker guiding clinicians in identifying the best therapy options for a specific cancer patient. Therefore, the goals of this first phase are critical, as tumor cells in biopsy samples taken from patients show differences in heterogeneity, count, and in most cases, lose their viability within 24-48 ex vivo. In Phase I, key technologies will be developed that will enable a sSMR chip to process samples with various cell types and counts at a high throughput and rate. The research activities to address the technical challenges for analyzing primary samples will be three-fold. First, while maintaining the measurement precision, the flow rate of cells in the chip will be increased to prevent primary tumor cells from adhering to channel walls. This is challenging, because the precision of measurement is inversely proportional to the time duration each cell spends in the chip. Second, an opto-fluidic switching technique will be implemented on chips with a new microfluidic T-junction design enabling imaging and characterization of particle morphology, and the avoidance of dead cells, debris, and doublets to improve assay robustness and throughput. Third, by leveraging the microfluidic T-junction and developed imaging capabilities, a microfluidic cell enrichment technique will be developed. This feature will allow for a larger panel of drug conditions to be tested on tumor biopsies with limited cell counts. For validation of these innovations, response of tumor cells taken from 10 multiple myeloma patients to a panel of three drugs and their combinations will be measured and analyzed.

The collaborative activities will be performed in partnership between Boston University (BU), Tufts University (TU) and the University of Diponegoro (UNDIP), Semarang, Indonesia. A cohort of six students per year will gain hands-on laboratory and field experience in coastal zone research during a six-week stay at the foreign institution.

Coastal cities worldwide are facing the enormous task to become resilient against physical, social and economic challenges, in addition to challenges due to climate variations. Semarang (Indonesia) is one of the cities that exemplifies the multiple threats affecting society, economy, environment, and infrastructure. Assessing the impacts of present and future coastal hazards requires an understanding of the complex interactions between geological, hydrological, biophysical and socioeconomic systems. This can be best achieved by an integrated approach that includes research on both land and sea dynamics to identify natural and anthropogenic factors, their relative influences and related consequences. This project seeks to undertake effective, innovative, and transformative research to understand how coastal environments respond to natural and anthropogenic factors. Geospatial technology combined with big data analytics will be applied to assessing and monitoring the effects of coastal hazards with the goal to enable the sustainable adaptation of coastal areas to global environmental change. Students will learn data acquisition techniques and the ability to analyze and interpret scientific information.

The proposed research will combine field experience with cutting edge geospatial technology and data analytics to investigate the following research questions:
1. Is land subsidence in Semarang coastal area mainly caused by natural or anthropogenic processes? Or both? How can we determine the prevailing factors; whether it is due to groundwater abstraction, tectonic movement, volcanic activities or a combination of factors? 
2. To what extent is the marine productivity of coastal waters near Semarang city affected by changing climatologic conditions of oceanic and atmospheric parameters in Java Sea? How is climate variations impacting fisheries resources and the economic productivity of coastal communities? How can we build models that show the linkages? 
3. How can we effectively monitor and assess coastal marine ecosystems health and productivity? Are artificial patch reefs and mangrove reforestation efforts in Semarang coastal region effective solutions for protecting and rehabilitating coastal ecosystems? 
4. How can geospatial technology and big data analytics help in revealing crucial interactions between ecological, economic and policy aspects to assess and manage the environmental risks? How can we measure and assess the changes in food intake pattern and food safety in relation to extreme weather and coastal hazards?

This project will establish a long term collaborative research and training program between US and Indonesian faculty and students. US students majoring in STEM fields will have an opportunity to conduct research and field work in an international and multi-disciplinary setting by engaging in problem solving research activities. They will be mentored by foreign collaborators and US PIs through web video conferencing and workshops jointly taught at the collaborating institution. The IRES experience is expected to a) broaden and leverage partnerships with overseas institutions, b) enhance US-student global awareness and perspectives, and c) develop multi-disciplinary themes that improve understanding of global change such as coral bleaching, habitat diversity, and coastal hazards. Research findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences. In partnership with UNDIP and relevant agencies in Northern Central Java region, decision support products resulting from this project will be distributed.

Privacy and security are critical for realizing Big Data's promise to advance society.  If data are used without regard to privacy of individuals or protection of the data, then individuals may be hurt.  If the data?s authenticity is not guaranteed, or if data are not permitted to be used at all due to privacy and security concerns, then the data's value is not realized. As the information that is collected about us grows in quantity, scientific and commercial value, and sensitivity, addressing these challenges is crucial to accessing the benefits of big data while ensuring that privacy and associated basic rights such as free speech and association are respected.   Through two workshops hosted by DIMACS, this planning project will advance the research agenda on privacy and security for big data, build a community of interested researchers and practitioners, and propose regional activities in security and privacy related to the Northeast Big Data Hub.  The long-term vision of the project is to catalyze both foundational and practical advances in privacy and security for big data that have the ability to positively impact society by (1) expanding the extent to which individuals can have control over protection of their personal data, and (2) enabling data?s value to be harnessed for advances in areas including health, energy, smart cities and regions, finance, and education. 

The first event, a workshop on "Overcoming Barriers to Data Sharing including Privacy and Fairness", will bring together computer scientists, legal scholars, social scientists, and consumers of data to understand the extent to which privacy currently limits the sharing of data, including but not limited to research data, and to develop standards and best practices to enable new information flows in domains from healthcare to energy.  The second event, the "NE BD Hub Workshop on Privacy and Security for Big Data", will bring together privacy and security experts as well as experts in a variety of big data application areas to highlight privacy and security issues associated with each of the Northeast Big Data hub spokes.  Expected project outcomes include broad participation, development of new collaborations and partnerships, production and dissemination of tutorial and talk videos, and reports on planned activities and potential best practices.

A screening method that improves the predictability of drug responses in both safety and efficacy during preclinical drug testing would have a profound impact. Better drug screening methods will lead to improvements in successful clinical trial outcomes, thereby increasing the number of new drugs that are approved to enter the market. Increasing the availability of new drugs will improve treatment options for patients and increase survival rates.

This I-Corps project will introduce a new platform technology for preclinical drug screening to evaluate multi-cellular and multi-system responses. The technology represents a significant advancement to the field of tissue engineered models for drug screening by incorporating multiple tissue-systems into a single assay that provides physiologically relevant readouts for reliable drug response prediction.  The model integrates vascular function across multiple physiological systems; multi-system readouts are important for evaluating the effects of drugs on a tissue as an integrated whole.

International collaborations are becoming increasingly important in scientific research, but students and young researchers from the US face significant barriers to establishing productive research collaborations with international colleagues. This in turn limits the competitiveness of the US to conduct top-level science. This IRES project is designed to help meet these challenges by providing students and young researchers with opportunities for international training early in their educational and professional trajectories. This three-year project will support a total of 21 undergraduate and graduate students from three US institutions for research training and cultural experiences in Australia. The students will work with the U.S. PIs and Australian researchers on how dynamic environmental factors influence the social structure, behavior, and fitness of small songbirds in an understudied environment?dry forests -outside Brisbane. The project will provide technical training in modern integrative behavioral ecology methods, and will build the capacity of IRES students to work with foreign collaborators in the future. IRES students will also use a range of dissemination modalities, including professional presentations at conferences, peer-reviewed journal publications, video, and internet productions, to increase interest in international research among US university students, K-12 students, and the general public. Participants will receive intensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from both U.S. and Australian senior researchers. The project will broaden access to international STEM research by actively recruiting and retaining students from under-represented groups. In doing so, it will fulfill the IRES program goals of educating a globally-engaged science and engineering workforce capable of performing in an international research environment.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the unacceptable incidence of orthopedic device-related infections, as well as the dangerous rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. More than 100,000 implanted orthopedic fixation devices (pins, plates, and screws) acquire bacterial infections each year in the US, accounting for approximately $1.5 trillion in associated medical and surgical treatment costs. Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to treat these infections has led to a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, which poses a severe risk to human health. This project aims to develop and optimize a commercially viable process to impart orthopedic fixation devices with a unique surface nanotexture designed to inhibit bacterial attachment and disrupt the biofilm cycle while simultaneously stimulating robust implant integration with adjacent bone. Importantly, this treatment acts via topography alone and does not incorporate antimicrobial agents or pharmaceuticals. Due to the ubiquity and gravity of the infection epidemic, this first-of-its-kind antibacterial surface technology is expected to rapidly infiltrate the orthopedic device market and drive a dramatic market shift towards the development of products with enhanced biological activity. Ultimately, this project has the potential to alleviate significant clinical and economic burdens while stimulating technological advances in a competitive market. 

The proposed work aims to create an antibacterial surface nanotexture by utilizing a proprietary modified atomic deposition technique. The fabrication parameters used during this deposition process are closely linked to the resulting surface characteristics (and thus its antimicrobial efficacy). However, the link between fabrication parameters and antimicrobial efficacy is inadequately understood currently. Therefore, the proposed work employs a systematic strategy to elucidate the relationships involved and establish control over the fabrication process and resulting surface properties. The project is separated into four stages, each designed to explore the effect of a specific fabrication parameter on performance outcomes, including bacterial colonization, bone cell functions, and trends in certain surface properties that often correlate with cell-substrate interactions (e.g. surface energy, roughness, skewness, etc.). The relationships revealed through testing will be used to build a set of equations that describe how the properties of the nanotextured surface vary as a function of the fabrication parameters. This set of equations will then be used to optimize the system, enabling consistent and controllable operation of the deposition process as manufacturing specifications evolve. In addition to advancing the development of a market-changing product, the proposed research will contribute to the growing understanding of cell and bacteria responses on nanostructured surfaces in an ongoing effort to mitigate infection associated with orthopedic implants.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make organizations more productive by helping them organize operational data in a structured yet accessible way. Today, organizations tend to accumulate such data in spreadsheets, scattered across users and folders, with new copies and revisions being made every time data must be presented, summarized, or integrated in a new way. This leads to tedious cut-and-paste workflows, costly errors, and a lack of reliable information for decision support. This project proposes a general-purpose software solution, based on a recently developed method for interactive database visualization. The system's novelty is in the ease and flexibility with which data can be queried and laid out on the screen, covering a large range of use cases that would previously require custom programming. Applications can be found in all manner of organizations: corporations, non-profits, higher education, science, healthcare, journalism, disaster response, the military, public administration, and so on.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a general-purpose, user-friendly software product that individuals within an organization can use to store and share structured data along with the various data displays through which said data is viewed, queried, and edited. Such data displays could include arbitrary database queries, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, and bar charts, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. Using the proposed software, organizations can decrease time spent on administrative and managerial tasks, improve the use of data in decision-making, and, in many cases, eliminate yearlong internal software development projects.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to promote empowerment of millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people by enabling greater independence, supporting increased educational attainment, proliferation of vocational opportunities, and enhancing their overall quality of life. There are currently no commercial solutions for providing BVI users with an assistive technology (AT) solution that allows BVI users to seamlessly access textual and graphical information via a unified system. Towards meeting this greater goal, this Phase I SBIR project addresses key challenges relating to technical feasibility in creating the core algorithms of Midlina and the functional viability proving that BVI users will find practical utility in its application. By providing a much-needed AT solution leveraging touchscreen devices such as smart phones as a platform (which is already owned and used by more than 80% of BVI users), this project has a high probability of user adoption and market acceptance when commercialized. Given that vision loss is expected to double in the next 20 years owing to age-related eye diseases experienced by the rapidly aging population, this project will have significant economic benefits for the State/Federal agencies providing support services to BVI and aging population.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show that a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, will allow blind and visually-impaired (BVI) individuals to independently access textual and graphical information from digital media. The key innovation and strength of the proposed solution is in its ability to achieve this convergence of seamless text and graphical information access by integrating with native mobile operating systems (OS) used on smart touchscreen-based devices, the fastest growing computational platforms among BVI users. This project builds on strong theoretical underpinnings derived from 5-years of NSF-sponsored academic research involving hundreds of human testers and represents an excellent translational path towards commercialization. Two objectives will drive this Phase I project: (1) Developing a novel visual-to-multimodal conversion algorithm that is seamlessly integrated with a native mobile operating system, and (2) Establishing technical feasibility and practical usability of a prototype system through rigorous human user testing. A successful outcome of this Phase I project would lead to: (1) development of core algorithms for a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, and (2) demonstrate feasibility that Midlina will enable BVI people to independently access both textual and graphical contents from digital media.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop disease resistant soybean varieties that will reduce the substantial losses in agricultural production caused by plant diseases.  Loss to disease can be as high as 40% globally and cost billions of dollars annually. In soybean alone, an estimated $3 billion dollars of production value is lost from plant diseases annually.  In addition, the destruction of crops by plant diseases threatens global food security and has a significant negative impact on the environment due to the use of pesticides. Application of a tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistance strategy in agriculturally important crops will have a major societal impact by protecting crops from devastating diseases for which alternative solutions are not currently available, securing agricultural production, and reducing environmental pollution from agricultural chemicals.  In the future, the goal is to apply the proposed technology to other agriculturally important crops such as corn, rice, and tomato.

The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to engineer tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistant soybean varieties. In this project, a soybean immune regulatory cassette will be constructed through sequence homology, and then functionally validated by demonstrating pathogen-inducible resistance against various diseases with minimal yield penalty. The methods that will be used in this project include bioinformatic analysis of soybean sequences to identify homologous defense genes and corresponding regulatory elements, molecular cloning, transformation of both Arabidopsis and Soybean plants, and testing the resulting transformant plants to determine levels of resistance to different types of pathogens. Results from this project will be essential for moving forward with larger field trials, which to be accomplished in the Phase II of the project.

This challenge will become significantly more difficult as sensors, vehicles, and other sources provide more real-time data. Without such platforms, along with modeling and visualization tools, the promise of smart city technologies will remain unattainable, especially for smaller or low-income communities. Big data analytic tools have become a critical missing link to smart community solutions and there is a growing demand from a variety of computer science disciplines, along with industry researchers and municipal governments, to share best practices and best-of-breed tools. Creating an approach that allows for the development of secure, open, flexible, and scalable smart community big data solutions will have lasting societal impact. 

Through the Smart Community Big Data Co-operative (the Co-op), US Ignite will leverage its 100 city, university, industry, and nonprofit partners to design, build and use the important capability of big data sharing to enhance local smart community efforts and generate enhanced community services. Communities are looking to quickly identify current gaps in their real-time data, applications, and modeling tools to design a cohesive smart community strategy with local partners. This current effort will extend this formula to launch new forms of smart community research, applications, and services that benefit end users through open data and data analytics.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of MedSwarm, a software product for radiology that will significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.

These materials could reduce or even eliminate the use of expensive precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium that are currently used in automotive exhaust after-treatment systems. Thus, aerogel catalysts could have a significant positive economic and environmental impact on this nation.  Commercialization of these novel materials will extend the design space available to pollution-control system engineers, and hence open new, potentially transformative, avenues for meeting current and future pollution regulations. In addition, this project will enable undergraduate students to develop entrepreneurial ideas and learn what is involved in bringing technology developed through fundamental research to the marketplace.

This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for catalytic aerogels. Aerogels are materials with remarkable properties, including unusually high surface area, low density, low thermal conductivity and a nanoporous structure that is stable at high temperatures. Aerogels can be fabricated using a rapid supercritical extraction method and tailored to contain different catalytic metal species such as copper, cobalt, vanadia and alumina. Research in this area is focused on developing methods for making different types of catalytic aerogels and on testing their effectiveness in pollution mitigation applications. Catalytic testing of copper-alumina aerogels under simulated automotive exhaust conditions has demonstrated that they are capable of converting unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide into less harmful gases.

Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness."

The proposed product will help law enforcement officers at municipal, county, state and federal levels discover clandestine human burials thereby aiding in the solution of crimes and enhancing public safety.  Likewise, applications in the military arena would enable discovery of the remains of soldiers missing in action (MIAs), mass graves created during genocide, and other casualties of conflict.  Because the technology of the product has a very general capability, a product based on the same hardware and software may be customized for a variety of commercial applications.  These include: (1) environmental mapping and remediation efforts; (2) cultural resource or heritage management, e.g., by documenting Native American burial grounds; (3) characterization of soil chemistry for agribusiness applications; (4) mapping of sites in archaeology.  All of these applications would create greater demand with resulting commercial and employment opportunities.  Finally, since successful applications will receive media attention, they will provide the opportunity to educate the public about the nature of the science, the value of scientific research to the public good, and technology involved in the product.

This I-Corps project involves a novel adaptation of existing technologies (spectroscopy, push-probe soil tests) to a new application within forensic science.  The basic concepts of the technologies are well-established.  The product, a robotic mobile device, pushes a probe into the ground at the test locations.  The probe has a window that allows the soil to be illuminated with visible and near infrared light.  Reflected light is collected by fiber optics which carry the light to the surface to be analyzed.  The fraction of each color of light that is absorbed by the soil carries the signature of the chemical content of the soil at each underground location.  These data are then interpreted in terms of the decay products (mainly fatty acids) that indicate the presence of human cadavers.  PI?s earlier research was successful in identifying burials in both controlled mock crime scenes and in real forensic contexts involving disturbed human graves.  The proposed product will provide real-time, reliable interpretation of the data to indicate the presence of a 'hit', an essential part of the value proposition of the product for law enforcement applications.  This marks a very significant improvement over current lab-based analyses.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce production costs of high-quality stem and primary cells for regenerative medicine (RM), consequently reducing medical expenses and improving the quality of life for individuals. RM has a projected global market of $67.6 billion by 2020, and is capable of repairing, replacing and regenerating tissues and organs that are affected by disease/disorder, age, or injury. The common cell harvesting methods cause severe damage to cells, especially primary cells and stem cells. Our technology allows harvesting damage free cells, i.e., retaining essential cell functionalities and characteristics, which are superior for RM. Damage free cells will also enhance basic life science research by obtaining more clinical relevant results that cannot be achieved by using cell lines or damaged cells. While there is one commercially available thermo-responsive product being used to reduce cell damages during harvesting, it is too expensive to be adopted widely. Our technology is low cost, scalable, reproducible, and serves large growing markets. Through this project, we will identify key markets for adoption, correctly define the key product attributes, and understand scaling requirements, hence providing a source of high-quality stem and primary cells for critical medical research and applications.

This I-Corps project will validate market potentials of applying thermo-responsive supports for damage free and chemical free cell harvesting, which is crucial for cell based regenerative medicine and basic life science research. Our technology for generating thermo-responsive supports employs a cost-effective and simple process that involves only 3 steps: blending, casting and thermal annealing of a thermo-responsive polymer and a network forming silane. During annealing, the silane molecules anchor to the surface while simultaneously forming networks to entrap polymer chains. Other reported thermo-responsive surfaces generally are prepared by using non-easily accessible electron beam irradiation or plasma polymerization to deposit a thermo-responsive layer, or painstakingly grow the thermo-responsive polymer on a surface. Also, as compared to the commercial product, our technology allows enhanced cell attachment and growth, and accelerated cell detachment upon cooling, thus avoiding cell damage. Therefore, our technology, described in research papers and patent protected, provides better platforms for commercial expansion of stem and primary cells and for basic research. In addition, our technology, with small scale samples, has been validated by another research group for a variety of applications.

The University of Alabama Site provides infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. Working with their regional I-Corps Node at the Georgia Institute of Technology, The University of Alabama Site will improve and expand AIME's current innovation curriculum and training programs. Site funding offers entrepreneurial teams the opportunity to increase their chance of commercial success through funds for the acquisition of modest amounts of equipment or materials needed to fabricate prototypes, travel expenses to consult with potential clients or experts, or other resources needed to directly advance the goals of transitioning a team's project into the marketplace. In addition, the Site offers access to resources and training to the sponsored entrepreneurial teams in order to nurture UA faculty, staff and students to transition their innovative technologies into the marketplace. 

Broader Impacts:
The direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization, transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies. The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities. In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts, providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit, which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site has the opportunity to enhance the value of new ventures and make them better-positioned to hire employees and create transformative products and services for the benefit of society."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is from a more cost-effective thin film technology to harvest sunlight and convert into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. The solar energy market is dominated by the crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin film solar panels. The CdTe thin-film panels require high energy consumption during manufacturing, and are constrained by the toxicity of Cd and limited earth storage of Te.  The project will explore the commercial opportunities of manufacturing antimony chalcogenides thin-film solar panel with lower cost, higher efficiency, and less energy consumption for residential, commercial and utility level application. The cost of the traditional thin-film solar panel could be significantly reduced by utilizing the knowledge of increasing the thin film solar cell efficiency and developing a cost-effective earth abundant antimony chalcogenide source. The reduced solar energy cost will further boost the application of solar energy in the US and provide alternative and sustainable clean energy for the whole of society.   

This I-Corps project is to discover which customer segment would value the photovoltaic efficiency of the Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells such that the commercialization potential will be realized. The Sb2Se3 is antimony based chalcogenides with orthorhombic structure (non-cubic structure), which are opposite to the traditional cubic chalcogenides thin film solar cells (i.e., CdTe, CuInGaSe).  These orthorhombic materials exhibit unique crystal structure which consists of quasi-one-dimensional ribbons weakly bonded by van der Waals forces, leading it to be a promising absorber material for photovoltaic application due to its properties of the high absorption coefficient, approximately 1.1 eV bandgap optimal for single junction solar cells. Sb2Se3, an earth-abundant constituent, has low toxicity and uses a low energy manufacture process. These above factors make Sb2Se3 to be a promising candidate to replace Cd, Ga/In in the commercial thin-film solar modules. These Sb2Se3 can be compatible with the traditional high throughput CdTe thin film solar cells manufacturing process. The Sb2Se3 technology provides alternative options for t lower cost solar energy in the US with a healthier environment footprint. Through the I-Corps project, the team expects to further investigate the which customer segment values this technology for thin film solar cells market.

"abstractText": "The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a path for integrating photovoltaics into a wide range of new form factors. The project will first explore the commercial potential of integrating high-performance, light-weight flexible solar panels onto freight truck trailers, shading fabrics, and military tents. When the large exterior surfaces of a freight truck trailer are covered by high-efficiency solar panels the technology can significantly improve overall diesel fuel efficiencies.  Retrofitting flexible solar panels onto shading fabrics, such as canopies, awnings, and car parking ports can potentially allow for local, potentially off-grid, power sources. The flexible solar panels will also potentially help the military cope with their power needs for operations occur in remote locations.  All these applications rely on the new form factors the core technology in this project enables.

This I-Corps project is based on core technology that overcomes major obstacles in perovskite solar cells, including their short lifetime, lengthy processing steps, and substantial efficiency drops from large-area fabrication on flexible substrates. Commonly used annealing approaches require prolonged heating at high temperatures to attain desired material properties. Therefore, they are not typically compatible with high-speed printing. The technology developed here accomplishes a rapid layer-specific photonic treatment for the target layer without damaging the underlying flexible substrate and perovskite materials. This innovative technology enables large-scale manufacturing of durable and fully-flexible perovskite solar cells through high-speed printing."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.

This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements."

Part 1
Nanofibers exhibit unique properties that have stimulated a massive effort in nanofibers research to address key challenges in high performance filtration, battery separators, wound healing, composites, blood vessel and tissue engineering, electrochemical sensing, smart textiles, drug delivery, and catalysis. Some recent examples include: Dermtreat's nanofibrous Rivelin patch for innovative treatment of mucosal diseases and DuPont's nanofiber-based EnergainT battery separator, which boosts up to 30% power of Li-ion batteries, just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2 billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures, and desirable properties.
Undergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process. ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries, joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.

Part 2
This project brings the ongoing collaborations to a higher level and establishes new collaborations in the emerging area of fabrication and application of nanofiber materials and structures with Technical University of Liberec (TUL, Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research), Lodz U of Technology (UT-Lodz, Poland, a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis), and  Aalto University (Finland, the #1 Finnish University with strong idea-to-industry programs in nanoscience and engineering). At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes dissemination activities. 
IRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner, and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders, and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain, and for the relevant fields.
IRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public, other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station. All participants will mutually benefit through a growing network of advanced research and training facilities. This project will enable, in a long-term perspective, a broader synergistic coupling between domestic and international research groups by bringing new collaborators and catalyzing the continuation of international student exchanges.

"abstractText": "Economic globalization is transforming the nature of the engineering profession.  The assignment of U.S. engineers overseas has become common business practice, as global enterprises establish corporate as well as research and development centers worldwide. To remain at the forefront of science and technology and to sustain our nation's global leadership in engineering, we must train our engineering graduates to be productive professionals in tomorrow's global business world and provide them the skills they will need to collaborate with international partners. This three-year IRES program will teach some of those critical skills to U.S. engineering students by providing hands-on research training and cultural experiences in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. The students will conduct research in Egypt with U.S. and Egyptian investigators in the increasingly important field of sustainable urban design. The need for sustainable housing and infrastructure is particularly acute in Egypt, a nation where 95% of the population lives on just 6% of the land area. Students will leverage the many national research initiatives currently underway in Egypt to investigate and test sustainable infrastructure designs. Participants will receive extensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from the U.S. and Egyptian researchers, with the ultimate goal of conducting high-level research and preparing research papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals. By working closely with their international mentors, the students will enhance their cross-cultural skills, foreign language abilities, and professional experience, preparing them to excel in a multinational environment.

This three-year IRES project will provide approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate engineering students research training and cultural experiences in Egypt. The students will work with U.S. mentors and Egyptian researchers at one of the leading national research centers in Egypt, the National Housing and Building Research Center. The program will focus on the multidisciplinary theme of Infrastructure Design for Sustainable Urban Communities. The Egyptian government is currently pressing major research initiatives and demonstration projects related to sustainable urban design, including entire new cities built around sustainability principles. Our students will leverage these ongoing programs to explore and evaluate new designs for urban infrastructure that consider building materials, construction methods, energy efficiency, and water conservation. Working with our Egyptian partners, the researchers have identified eight research projects for the first year of the program that address the topics of sustainable affordable housing, the assessment of sustainable building codes, infrastructure health monitoring, sustainable building materials, water and stormwater management, and intelligent building designs. Additional research topics will be developed in subsequent years. Students will work side-by-side with Egyptian researchers with the goal of performing high-level research and producing student-led, peer-reviewed publications. The program will ultimately produce students who have the skills and international perspective necessary to pursue careers in collaborative international research.

"abstractText": "IRES: Nanofibers for Resource Efficiency

A thematic basis of this program is the emerging area of nanofibers. Nanofibers have diameters from one to four orders of magnitude smaller than the diameters of conventional microfibers produced by mechanical drawing.  As a result of their small size, nanofibers can demonstrate superior properties that provide critical advantages in many applications.  Nanofibers (NF) are increasingly explored in high performance filtration, batteries and fuel cells, wound healing, composite material reinforcements, blood vessel and tissue engineering, smart textiles, drug delivery, gas sensors, electronics, and catalysis. The global market for NF is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 35% between 2014 and 2020 and reach ~$1 billion by 2017.  There are huge needs in the development of sizeable and ?green? production of NF from a larger range of materials, providing easier ways for NF processing into functional structures, and developing a skilled workforce.  This IRES will provide at least 18 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with unique hands-on experience and significant knowledge of cutting-edge NF fabrication methods, as well as NF testing and application by providing an intense research program at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in catalysis and bio-fuels in Poland. Students will develop practical skills needed to address the knowledge gaps in NF science and technology, bring their experiences back to their home institutions, and help to develop a global-capable workforce for this emerging market. By using a cohesive approach and drawing on complementary expertise, facilities and traditions across the nations and regions, will enhance the intellectual as well as the societal and economic returns of this IRES program.

This program will provide 18 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a unique opportunity to carry out 8 week of cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofiber science, technology, and biomedical and energy applications at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis, Poland.  Nanofibers (NF) form a large class of materials that can exhibit nano-enabled unique properties, which are unattainable at a larger scale.  However, the growth potential of the NF materials market is still hindered by the limited ability to efficiently generate sizeable quantities of nanofibers with predictable and controllable complex, macroscopic architectures and desirable properties.  Students will work at TUL with a new, high-rate, alternating-current electrospinning (ac-electrospinning) process that unveils several new physical phenomena which help to overcome major disadvantages of commonly used dc-electrospinning, such as ?whipping? instability and residual electric charge, while increasing the process productivity by 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude. Students will explore selected NF-based materials for advanced catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions at UT-Lodz, along with other applications tested at TUL.  During the pre-trip training, foreign site work, and post-trip activities, students will focus on advancing basic understanding of all aspects of emerging high-rate ac-electrospinning, in order to direct the assembly of NF into desired configurations and to stimulate the development of commercializable processes for nanofiber-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis, biomedical uses, and other potential applications.  Overall, this program shall facilitate a broader long-term collaboration between the US and international research groups within the nanofiber research and manufacturing domain by bringing new collaborators and facilitating multiple international links between the researchers and students in related areas."

Fifty percent of the world does not have access to ultrasound, a lifesaving tool, and yet there are more cell phones than toilets in the world, and mobile devices are multiplying faster than people. This concept leverages this trend of going mobile with a key technology to improve health outcomes for patients around the world.  This technology will be developed to reach the 50% of the world that still needs access to ultrasound imaging by increasing support and access to assistance with image interpretation. Clinicians in emerging economies are impeded by limited economic resources and lower levels of training that preclude the standard adoption of expensive traditional cart-based ultrasound imaging.  While improving maternal health is a key United Nations health objective and hence the first area of focus for this project, the ultimate goal is to be the number one mobile ultrasound in the world for healthcare professionals serving trauma/emergency care, women's health and family medicine patients.  

This I-Corps project will focus on learning about pain points of using existing ultrasound technology and barriers to adoption.  Medical students, OBGYN, family and emergency physicians will provide data and observations about their use of cart-based ultrasound.  Interviewing end users and buyers of ultrasound technology will illuminate challenges with learning ultrasound, understanding diagnoses, and navigating software platforms.  Knowing these challenges that potential customers have, the team will further develop and fine-tune the handheld ultrasound software platform they have created.  The technology has an advanced user interface and display, the ability to gain insights about a patient?s medical images, and the ability to conduct real-time diagnoses.  The technical results on which the project is based on feedback from probe manufacturers, ultrasound technology specialists, and clinicians of varying skill levels.  In addition to interviewing users and experts, the team will also conduct in-depth observations of various types of ultrasound technology in use.

Although the state of Arkansas has made progress in the development of high-growth businesses based on university research outcomes over the past decade, Arkansas continues to be one of the most economically challenged states in the country. The STEP Site encourages researchers to expand their horizons beyond the research they are doing in their labs and consider how the commercialization of their inventions might help promote economic development in the state. In addition to the broader impact of economic development, the STEP Site enables the university to continue its efforts to improve entrepreneurial education for females and underrepresented populations. The university's successful programs for underrepresented high school through graduate students provide a base upon which to build these efforts."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the adoption of a new standard for assessing the real-time condition of soil and geomaterials. The occurrence of extreme weather fluctuations and natural disasters have the potential to permanently disrupt modern society and agricultural practices by increasing soil erosion and decreasing usable land, soil fertility, and resistance to pests and disease. Growing populations will place more demand on agricultural production despite constrained amounts of available land. Technologies that assist with better nutrient management, planting, and harvesting techniques will aid in sustainable food production. Additionally, the need for better soil characterization and monitoring techniques are required in light of prominent failures of mine tailings dams. The safety of mining and large earth construction operations may be improved with the adoption of real-time, remote measurements of geomaterials. Lastly, more frequent and intense wildfires have led to more post-wildfire debris flows.  Dangers associated with the debris flow potential must be identified and characterized.  The optical, non-contact remote measurement technology that will be explored in this project has the potential to impact society as well as several markets and industries, ranging from precision agriculture to mining, hazard mitigation, and construction.

This I-Corps project will explore the applications of optical infrared technology.  The specific technology that will be explored was developed at the bench and field scale to remotely measure soil properties. The proposed innovation will advance agricultural and geotechnical engineering practices by enabling remote measurements of soil/crop condition and fertility, as well as static and dynamic soil parameters. Prior to the development of this technology, no method existed to remotely measure soil suction in the field. Because the measurements do not require contact with the soil, nor the collection of soil or water samples, the measurements are non-destructive. Furthermore, the rapidly collected measurements obtained will include many data points over a large area, improving spatial and temporal resolution over conventional point-wise data collection methods. The need to install labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive in situ instrumentation is then eliminated. The proposed technology also has the potential to save time and costs associated with conventional laboratory classification of soil properties and may also improve upon the poor reproducibility of some conventional testing methods.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "This project will collect baseline ecological data to record the response of a degraded tropical forest in the Bornean highlands to the introduction of an agroforestry system. The highlands were returned to indigenous (Kadazan) persons in Malaysian Borneo following two clear-cuttings over the last century; and the agroforestry system is designed to restore the forest canopy. 11 undergraduate and 2 MS students from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines will collect data in paid 8-week summer ecological field research experiences. Data include soil properties (organic matter, chemical content, pH, water holding capacity, fungi to bacteria ratio), arthropod diversity (beetles, ants and butterflies) and fructivorous and insectivorous bat communities. 

The data record ecological changes at producer sites and will be compared to sites at the same elevation in an adjacent and protected national forest range for ecological benchmarking.  Benchmarking serves to help qualify agroforestry practices for international green product labelling, which would substantially elevate producer incomes. Results will improve scientific understanding of the linkages among ecological communities in tropical forests from soil to canopy; and, finally, students will gain professional experience in designing ecological field experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and communicating results to stakeholders from different cultures and academics at professional conferences."

"abstractText": "This project creates an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Merced. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

The Merced Site is in cooperation with the Bay Area NSF Innovation Corps Node through the University of California, Berkeley. Merced will cultivate both innovation and teams that can meaningfully participate in the National Innovation Network to deliver innovation to society through the application of entrepreneurship. It will also develop methods for fostering innovation-based entrepreneurship in less diverse economies. UCMerced is in a rural, agricultural area of California that has not had much entrepreneurial activity in the past. However, in 2015 UCMerced established the Venture Lab which focuses on entrepreneurship and provides a locus of entrepreneurship in the greater community.

This is a unique Sites proposal given the age of the institution and their rural location. They have already created and succeeded with their Venture Lab and recruited a 10-member Advisory Board. The leadership is very experienced and has reached out to the surrounding community for collaboration and support and their connections are strong. Their curriculum is lean-centric. UCMerced has chosen a realistic Sites model - starting with 15 Site teams the first year, then 20, ramping up to 30 in their final year of funding.

This is an unusual environment to pilot a program in an institution that is essentially minority populated and located in an area that is in need of a boost to its ecosystem. The project is likely to have a profound impact on both the institution and the community."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in facilitating innovations in a wide range of industries working on advanced computing-based applications as the result of a reliable neuromorphic chip (where neural networks are etched into silicon). This technology may accelerate the advance of machine learning and ultimately realize a breakthrough in computing architecture by overcoming the Von Neumann bottleneck -- where the intrinsic latency originated from the separation of processor and memory. Empowered by neuromorphic features of this project's technology, machine learning may be carried out with unprecedented speed and efficiency in design and energy consumption. Hence, intensive machine learning based technologies such as face recognition, autonomous driving and other areas of artificial intelligence will be advanced by a significant margin. A successful execution of the project will also facilitate widespread commercialization of emerging applications utilizing artificial intelligence and/or neuromorphic computing. 

This I-Corps project leverages the recent innovative research related to highly controllable neuromorphic devices. The technology is based on the oxide-based resistive random access memory (ReRAM), a non-volatile memory based upon electrical stimuli-induced resistance changes, mostly by the formation and rupture of so-called nanoscale conducting filaments in each cell. The intrinsic resemblance of ReRAM cells to neuromorphic systems triggered a recent boom in related research. However, there are still considerable technical issues including wide cell-to-cell variations in operation voltage, cell current and operation speed. Unclear understanding of physical switching mechanisms precludes a rationale design of reliable cells for a commercial device. The proposed novel scheme, in which the uncontrollability is significantly minimized, is expected to achieve a breakthrough in realizing commercializable neuromorphic devices.

This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.

The partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address the growing challenge of mitigating global warming and air quality deterioration as a result of the present energy supply ecosystem. This challenge is further exacerbated by periods of economic prosperity due to an increase in energy consumption. With the power generation sector being the biggest consumer of primary energy and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse and air pollutant emissions worldwide, an accelerated deployment of renewable energy is needed. However, due to renewables' intermittency as an energy source, there is a need for solutions that provide a flexible and reliable supply at a competitive efficiency while also aligning with global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Today, this challenge is partially met with addition of distributed natural gas fired capacity, motivating natural gas usage to nearly double in the last two decades. This project will focus on a solution to provide flexible and benchmark efficient power while generating zero atmospheric emissions. This not only supports environmental efforts, but also aligns with basic economics, making it an appealing case for carbon capture where both the consumer and producer benefit. 

This I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential of a novel power solution based on the increasingly common reciprocating engine, by which its efficiency is radically increased and both air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Current solutions with traditional gas turbines and reciprocating engines fail to address air quality concerns by emitting high volumes of particulate matter and nitrous oxides. Efficiency benchmark technologies such as combined cycle gas turbines are unable to follow power demand fluctuations, nor are they able to cost effectively reduce their carbon footprint through carbon capture measures. This project will potentially address the unmet need for simultaneously flexible, efficient and clean power by proposing a retrofit technology that provides a transition into a utility scale hydrogen energy storage solution.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the advanced biomedical treatments that can be delivered using recombinant protein-based materials. In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces, low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and increase patient comfort.

This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-interactive properties.

More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition.  To reduce the risk of injury or death, neurologists frequently recommend caregivers constantly monitor patients, resulting in co-sleeping, significant changes in work and family schedules, and a substantial loss of independence. However, even under monitored conditions, caregivers fail to recognize more than 50% of seizures, resulting in sub-optimal treatment. Although technology is available to detect seizures in clinical settings, the necessary equipment is not currently suitable for continuous use in daily living.  The development and validation of technology to detect and alert patients and caregivers to all types of seizures in a non-clinical setting would have substantial benefits for timely treatment, improve patient outcomes, and improve patient and caregiver quality of life.

This I-Corps project further develops a core technology that uses analysis of eye movements to provide a reliable, reproducible means of identifying seizure activity. The team is developing wearable eye-tracking technology and software suitable for identifying all seizure types during wakefulness and sleep. This work will significantly advance understanding of seizures through rigorous mathematical analysis of eye movements which previously has been only qualitatively described. The core technology analyzes eye movements, known as oculometrics, to detect seizures.  The goal is to transform how at-risk individuals and caregivers identify and respond to seizures, potentially reducing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and improving quality of life.

In response to increasing demand for new types of jobs, degree programs such as Computational Genomics and Music Technology have combined fields that have historically been distinct.  This project enables students to discover both traditional and emerging majors relevant to them. By providing actionable insights and better alignment of interests early on, this decreases the friction of changing majors (~80% currently) during college and begins to mitigate widespread lack of engagement (~70%) in the workplace.  Compared with traditional methods that match GPAs, test scores, unstructured essays, and resumes, with schools, majors, and job openings, this project could revolutionize the way students identify, train and prepare for their future careers.

This I-Corps project is based on a novel patent-pending technology of a unified multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome. Skills Genome can be exploited by several machine learning models, allowing for capturing and modeling complex student data inputs such as critical thinking, communication, interests, leadership, etc. with temporal graphs.  By making the structure of the graph accessible to several machine learning models, the method improves accuracy, relevance and facilitates scale.  Specifically, this tracks the student?s development timeline, so they can best determine the timing and sequencing of skills needed for their chosen careers.  Further, by matching profiles at scale, new insights into potential careers can be surfaced, along with the next steps needed to achieve them.

Currently the biotechnology industry is growing at an astounding 7.5% per annum with a predicted value of $760B by 2025.  However, industrial fermentation plant failure data collected over a 15-year period suggests that 1 in 10 process cultures are subject to microbial contamination and associated production failure. Furthermore, while continuous bioreactor processes significantly improve productivity and reduce unit operation costs, most biotechnology industries shy away from them because of the inherent sensitivity to contamination.  Reduced bioreactor failure rate and operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-commodity chemicals such as biofuels, as production costs are a big impediment to large-scale manufacture; and their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. Our technology can increase the productivity and profit margin of these companies. With our technology, large-scale bio-commodity chemicals production could become economically feasible. In addition to reduced operational costs, antibiotic-free production alleviates antibiotic misuse in industries to promote a positive environmental and public heath impact.

This I-Corps project comprises a novel biocide/biocide-resistant system that could be used to treat and prevent microbial contamination in bioreactors. This technology allows bioprocessing engineers to eliminate the microbial contamination problem by addition of a biocide into the bioprocessing hosts' growth medium. The biocide prohibits the outgrowth of accidental contaminants while a biocide-resistant enzyme protects the bioprocessing host. The system also contains an on/off switch that allows easy removal of the biocide as needed. Preliminary data demonstrates that heterologous expression of the biocide-resistant enzyme in Escherichia coli and subsequent directed evolution resulted in a biocide-resistant Escherichia coli with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 16 times higher than the negative controls. We further demonstrate that this biocide in combination with the expression of biocide-resistant enzyme can be used to successfully treat a contaminated bioreactor.

This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.

This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings."

One study calculated the economic costs of this problem in the United States to be over $2 billion in 1993, leading to longer hospitalizations, loss of income, and higher insurance premiums. Of greater importance, these errors can be traced to over 7,000 deaths.  Consumer segments include any medical institution that administers medications including medical centers, academic, major metropolitan, and regional hospitals, surgery centers, urgent care centers, dental and veterinarian offices, and nursing homes.

This I-Corps project is a proposal for a medical device designed to decrease medication errors and be compatible with vials currently used in the hospital. It uses cameras to read a printed code on a vial to positively identify the medication for safety, contraindications, expiration, manufacturer recall, and previous usage to dispense medication contained inside without the use of needles, syringes, or labels. It will also decrease medication delivery times, adverse drug reactions, contamination, counterfeiting, and waste. Our device also consists of a backend database that keeps track of medications tagged with a code to provide a record of medication given to patients. The database can be updated to prevent the delivery of recalled, expired, and previously used medications.
	
The basis of this device is a barcode medication administration (BCMA) system to give medication to patients and manage inventory of medications in pharmacies. Most medication errors occur from the use of intravenous medications from a number of different sources and are the leading cause of complications by anesthetists. This apparatus can improve workflow efficiency and provide multiple safety nets by automatically alerting the anesthetist to contraindicated medications and allergies, sending reminders for redosing medications, and documenting medication administration.

Across the sciences, state and industry, new forms of data collection and analysis hold the prospect of our being able to address the major social and scientific issues of our times: from responding to natural disasters to monitoring the environment to developing fundamental technological insights which will revolutionize industry.  None of this will happen by fiat ? the development of the appropriate data analytics must be accompanied by new organizational alignments between research, policy and industry.  The Big Data Hubs and Spokes (BDHubs) program is a key site for analyzing the nature of these alignments with a view to gaining a basic understanding of the stakes as the terrain shifts.  All long-term research and innovation infrastructure must adapt to such ongoing changes. This research will contribute to understanding institutional flexibility: strategies, techniques and organizational innovations to adapt to changes in regulatory, policy and funding environments.  We can expect but not precisely predict, continuing transformations in the sociotechnical, scientific and institutional ecologies of today?s research and scientific infrastructure.  This project will investigate the ongoing activities at the BDHubs and its partner institutions, their emerging plans for the future, and tie these to the long-history of developing research infrastructures (50+ years) to understand the changes we can expect BDHubs to encounter over time (scientific, technological and institutional), and what strategies they employ in the face of transformations to the landscape of science, information technology and institutional environment. 

Many challenges facing contemporary science such as environmental research or chronic disease management require long-term studies and supporting infrastructures. This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government. Improving understanding of the long-term trajectory of research infrastructure will lead to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the part of project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders. Many other science agencies are in the midst of funding such cross-cutting projects. This research will inform science policy and regulatory environments to help develop sustainable and productive research infrastructures. In order to do so, this study will develop a general organizational understanding of the development of large-scale and long-term endeavors in the data sciences and map the institutional landscape of modern data science with particular focus on the activities of infrastructure building, policy development and community formation. In addition, this study will help to develop an understanding of the ?rise of the data sciences? in the US both as an institutional movement and as a form of technical research, with special focus on establishing a framework for evaluating and understanding large-scale, cross-disciplinary collaboration on big data tools, techniques and methods."

This project establishes an I-Corps Site at  the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA).

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This project at UCLA provides mechanisms for thirty teams a year to receive seed funding to accelerate translational research in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) across campus. The additional funding and entrepreneurial instruction enabled by this grant complements existing programs at UCLA and prepares the selected teams to benefit from a variety of resources available on campus, facilitating commercialization and new business formation.
 
Led by the Price Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in the UCLA Anderson School of Management, the goals of the Site are to establish: 1. An interdisciplinary UCLA I-Corps Site Team Selection Committee to oversee the annual award of thirty grants to competitively selected UCLA I-Corps Site Teams per year that will use the grants for STEM related projects to prepare applications for UCLA?s collection of entrepreneurial plan competitions, on campus accelerators and incubators, and translational governmental funding; 2. A new UCLA I-Site Lean Startup Course that will be taught three times annually for UCLA I-Corps Site Teams by Price Center entrepreneurship faculty; 3. Three existing UCLA entrepreneurial courses enhanced to enable enrolled UCLA I-Corps Site Teams to utilize grants during the course. 

Broader Impacts:
This grant may benefit society given that sponsored translational research and training at UCLA will directly impact the Southern California Economic Region which consists of 18.4M people (5.9% of the U.S. population) and contributes $924B in GDP (16th largest economy in the world). With 28,700 undergraduates (11.8% are international students) and 12,000 graduate students representing all fifty states and nearly 80 countries worldwide, this grant in conjunction with entrepreneurial education at UCLA impacts beyond the borders of California."

If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.

This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the routine clinic-based diagnosis and treatment of patients with cognitive impairment, including various types of dementia. Given the aging of U.S. populations, and the prevalence of dementia in elderly patients, patients with cognitive impairment will be an increasing management problem in healthcare systems. This project's information system will allow primary care providers to manage complex cognitively impaired cases without needing a referral to specialists, and without needing additional provider time with patients. Primary care providers generally manage simple cases of mild cognitive impairment, and refer more complex cases to neurologists, neuropsychologists, and geriatric specialists, which can cause economic and patient-care problems. Specialty care for cognitively impaired individuals can also be sparse outside of major metropolitan areas, which causes serious challenges to the equitable delivery of health care for rural and underserved communities. Primary care providers would potentially benefit with increased revenue and better care of the patients. Patients would potentially benefit from their care being managed by fewer physicians, and have more rapid access to diagnosis and treatment. Society will potentially benefit from lower population-health costs and improved healthcare outcomes.

This I-Corps project proposes to develop an information system to manage patients with cognitive impairment by providing primary care providers with an integrated set of evidence-based screening, diagnostic, treatment and monitoring modules. These modules will include a diagnostic test for cognitive impairment based upon computer-analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data using a new technique based upon preliminary results. Because of its low cost, rapidity, and non-invasive nature, EEG has great promise as an office-based clinical test for brain diseases. However, to date, standard techniques of EEG analysis have not been accurate enough for routine clinical use. Similarly, currently, there are no tests that are FDA-approved for assessing cognitive impairments associated with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Another strong component of this envisioned information management system will be its recommendation of care plans personalized for each patient based on artificial intelligence-based models. In addition, the information management software will have the ability to connect the patient to other local services that are often needed by patients with dementia and other brain diseases.

"abstractText": "This project will support the "Graduate-level Research in Industrial Projects for Students-Berlin" (GRIPS) led by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). The program will offer graduate students in mathematics and related disciplines the opportunity to work on industry-sponsored research problems in Berlin through a collaboration with Research Campus MODAL in Berlin, Germany. MODAL has existing industrial partners affiliated with their laboratories that provide their research groups with interesting and challenging research problems.  The program will be eight weeks in length; eight US graduate students will participate each summer.  Half of the US students each year will be women, and one or more will be a member of an underrepresented ethnic group. MODAL will  recruit 8 European students to form 4 research groups of two US and two European students each, and provide academic mentors. The program will not only produce interesting research in applications of mathematics to real-life problems, but will give a diverse group of US students an insight into industrial research and provide them with hands-on experience of working on industrial problems. One of the goals of the program is to make the students aware of the multiple career pathways open to them and highlight the value and adaptability of their mathematics skills as applied to interesting real-life problems.  The students will also receive invaluable experience collaborating with foreign colleagues and companies. The projects will be the natural outgrowth of MODAL's existing industry research partnerships, and will be selected in collaboration with IPAM.    Participants will produce a final report on their work, and will be encouraged to submit their work for conference presentations and/or publication in technical journals.  It is expected that many of the participants will continue the research and collaborations they started in the program.

Applied mathematics research has become increasingly important and relevant to engineering problems and, indeed, to everyday life. Increasingly, core applied mathematics topics, ranging from applied probability, to partial differential equation, to optimization, find important applications in areas such as materials science, mathematical biology, operations research, and, more recently, machine learning. Applications of mathematical techniques to real-life problems require both a deep understanding of mathematical theory, as well as acute awareness of both the physical and technical aspects of the problem, as well as implementation details of any numerical algorithms or simulations. For this reason, such successful applications are often a combination of individual and team efforts, with the main problem being divided into more specialized parts, and specific expertise of each team member brought to bear on each such  component.The exact topics of the research projects will change from year to year and will depend on the interest of industry and academic researchers involved.  Generally speaking, the projects will apply mathematical techniques to questions of optimization (such as optimization of rail network throughput), efficient simulation (such as simulation of modern nanophotonic devices) and machine learning (such as analysis of medical mass data sets).

These data streams are highly dimensional with multiple sensors observing same or similar phenomena over multiple sensory spectrums and scales. These are also sometimes real-time and/or have strong timing relationships that is necessary to support metropolitan infrastructure through effective analytics and policy support. The project brings together a diverse number of partners utilities, universities, companies and cities with the ability to contribute novel tools and urban sensor data and to translate knowledge into actions. MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations."

"abstractText": "The scientific communities of the U.S. and China suffer from a lack of direct contact between their junior members of the two countries, especially students. The proposed International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program will support 24 U.S. undergraduate students to conduct research in applied mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The IRES students will be assigned to teams, each consisting of two US and two Hong Kong students, and each team will work on a research project sponsored by a Chinese company or government agency. The US students will live and work at HKUST with students from Hong Kong. The project will be supervised overall by the PI, with local supervision by HKUST Mathematics Professor and Department Chair Yang Wang and Professor Shingyu Leung. The nine-week-long collaborative project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international mathematics research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will increase the visibility of U.S. students in Hong Kong and China through their activities in the HKUST campus and through their direct collaboration with Hong Kong students. The US student participants will be about 50% women and 20% from an underrepresented minority group demonstrating NSF?s commitment to participation in STEM fields by under-represented minority groups.

The IRES project will provide U.S. students with valuable experience in mathematics research, industrial research, international collaboration, and team work at a highly-regarded research institute. The research projects and sponsors will change every year, which is by design to keep the projects at the leading edge of scientific research. All projects involve mathematics on important current problems.  Recent examples (and industrial sponsors) include Doubly Ensemble Movie Prediction with Social Media Data Using TBEEF (Baidu), Detection of Somatic Mutations in Sequenced Pair Samples (BGI), Probabilistic Radar-Based Nowcasting of Monsoonal Rainstorms in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Observatory), Improved Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Systems (Huawei), and Intelligent Eye for the Visually Impaired (Lenovo). We expect each project to result in publications and lead to further research collaboration.  The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will better prepare them for their professional careers."

"abstractText": "This project, from the University of California - Riverside (UCR), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. 

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This I-Corps Site is managed by the UC Riverside Entrepreneurial Proof of Concept and Innovation Center (EPIC). EPIC is a regional program that operates in partnership with the County and major local cities to offer a suite of services and tools to help teams of innovators and entrepreneurs launch knowledge-based companies. In addition, UCR partnered with Riverside City College to allow their upper level students to participate as I-Corps team members. To ensure representative participation of females and students from underrepresented minorities, EPIC designates successful I-Corps graduates as Student Ambassadors to promote and mentor students from those two groups. Teams completing the EPIC I-Corps workshops receive additional support from EPIC's suite of services and from other programs offered by EPIC's network of regional partners.

Active collaboration with the region's universities and community colleges, regional incubators and accelerators create synergies within the region and accelerate development of the needed ecosystem that will attract and create knowledge-based companies and jobs. The success of EPIC and the UCR NSF I-Corps site are instrumental in the creation of the ecosystem needed to support innovation and entrepreneurship at UCR and in Riverside County, a region that lacks history and experience in entrepreneurism. Long-term outcomes of this initiative will be greater retention of UCR graduates in the region, increased employment from company creation and the relocation of knowledge-based businesses to Riverside County. These high-paying technology jobs represent a major economic stimulus into a region whose economy has historically been based on agriculture and low-wage jobs."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on healthcare, quality of life, and the medical device industry is tremendous. The novel technology and advancement of biodegradable metals and biomimetic interfaces will lead to next-generation medical devices and implants that promote tissue healing and eliminate secondary surgeries for implant removal. This will improve quality of life for patients who need medical implants to support bones and tissue damaged by disease or trauma, and reduce overall healthcare costs. The project will build the foundation for commercializing biodegradable metallic implants and devices, which, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the medical device industry. The products resulting from this project will reduce pain and complications, eliminate secondary surgeries, and accelerate healing and recovery for patients who need medical implants due to trauma or disease.

This I-Corps project will advance technology that eliminates the drawbacks of the non-degradable medical alloys on the market today. Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are a novel class of biodegradable metallic materials that have attractive mechanical and biological properties for a wide range of medical implant applications, such as orthopedic, spinal, dental, and craniofacial implants. The key challenge in commercializing Mg-based alloys for medical implant applications lies in controlling the degradation rate. NSF support has contributed to a novel class of biocompatible Mg alloys along with biomimetic surface treatment to provide tunable degradation rates, desirable bioactivity, and excellent mechanical strength for supporting faster healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. This novel solution contains non-toxic natural elements that induce healing and reduce inflammation, departed from traditional alloy design. The I-Corps project will transform this technology to commercially viable products that will benefit the customers in need.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, based on a portable blood perfusion monitor, lies in its likelihood of reaching new markets and applications beyond current blood perfusion monitor systems. This could have a significant societal impact, as this technology's lower cost compared to other available systems will allow for more routine blood perfusion monitoring (e.g. in preventative medicine), which could improve public health. Further, the compactness and portability of this technology, along with its related elimination of the need for a standalone diagnostic technician, makes its use in healthcare applications in remote and field locations highly feasible. Due to the potential to reach new customers and applications, this technology could be disruptive by addressing unmet needs in diagnostic medicine.

This I-Corps project is based around a portable blood perfusion monitor device. The device uses laser speckle imaging technology, which images blood flow non-invasively by reflecting low-power laser light off of tissue and into a camera. By capturing several images in rapid succession and comparing the frames, regions with relative motion (in this case, blood flow) can be visually mapped onto an image of the tissue. The intellectual merit of this portable perfusion device is that it utilizes a new method of processing the data to compare the sequential frames, this new method requiring substantially lower computing power than existing methods. As a result, mini-processors can be used in place of full computer processors, allowing for miniaturization of the device and reduction of the material costs. As well, the device is capable of attaching to existing surgical equipment and functions in real time during surgery, shortening time needed for the surgical process and improving timeliness and quality of associated data. Various prototypes of this device have been tested in mice, and the results demonstrate the ability of this device to provide detailed maps of blood flow, including micro-vessels.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project's technology, based on computing, engineering and materials technologies, may provide a sense of safety and comfort to anosmics (those who suffer from a loss of a sense of smell).  People with a loss of their sense of smell are typically  concerned about being near potential hazards that are difficult to detect without a sense of smell, such as fires, gas leaks, food that is spoiling, and hazardous chemicals. As there are no methods or products that can closely mimic the human nose, the detection performance and user-friendliness of a substitute device will target a relatively untapped market -- approximately 5% of the general population or over 15 million people in the United States alone. It is anticipated that this project's device will be a more affordable, reliable and less invasive alternative to surgery or other treatments. Furthermore, the technology can be used in a wide range of applications, such as drug or explosives detection, food quality monitoring (such as identifying diseases and/or ripeness of fruits and other produce), air quality monitoring and control, harmful solvent detection for defense application, and smart bandage for wound monitoring.

This I-Corps project involves the manufacture of a device with a high-density, high-performance gas sensor array based on nanotechnology, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The facile, fast fabrication methods of nanomaterials as sensing materials introduces the possibility of mass manufacturing. Real-time response to a range of gas analytes along with fast recovery of the sensing medium provides a solid technical foundation for this project. Currently at a pre-alpha prototyping stage, the device, with its full integration with a custom-designed circuit board and precisely fabricated sensing nanomaterials, not only eliminates the need for tedious and costly microfabrication, which is typical for gas sensors, but may also be able to imitate the detection level of a human nose, even exceeding the detection performance for some gas analytes.

U.S. students will be trained through collaborative research between two teams -- UCR's VLSI System and Computation Research Lab (VSCLAB) and Tsinghua University's Design Automation Lab.   Each year five American students will participate in the IRES program. IRES students will spend 10 weeks (one academic quarter) at UCR and 10 weeks at Tsinghua University, China. Specific IRES collaborative research, education and culture activities are planned to expose U.S. undergraduate or graduate students to the global engineering education and research environment through US-China academic collaboration. The collaborative educational and research activities will provide unique training, mentoring, networking and intellectual development opportunities for students at UCR, which is a growing and Minority Serving Institution. This project thus provides a unique opportunity to contribute to diversity in the U.S. technical workforce. Such international engagement will benefit the students' entire careers and make them more competitive and competent in their careers as scientists and engineers.  Furthermore, building long-term connections with top-tier engineering schools like Tsinghua University will help U.S. scientists and engineers maintain competitiveness in the long term.  Finally, the joint research will strengthen existing computer engineering research and education programs, and broaden the collaborative research work at UCR.

 The IRES collaborative project will produce important research advances through joint development of efficient algorithms and design methodologies to address the grand challenges of reliability-aware physical design and optimization of VLSI systems. The researchers will work on the most severe and challenging aspects of verification and design problems of silicon CMOS based integrated systems in current and coming 10nm/7nm nodes: modeling, analysis of long-term interconnect reliability effects such as electromigration (EM), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), bias temperature instability (BTI) and reliability-aware physical design and optimization. The mutual interests and complementary knowledge, and established trust between the two research teams is critical for the success of the student training, mentoring and the proposed joint research project. The education and research activities of this joint project consist of following activities: student training, mentoring and intellectual development via pre-trip preparation and on-site visits; new courses and seminar development for proposed research topics; joint research projects and student supervision and publications; promoting and nurturing diverse cohorts of U.S. students; evaluation for continuous improvement of the program.

"abstractText": "The scientific goal of this IRES is to gain better understanding for the fabrication of air-stable, photon upconversion thin films or liquids that can operate efficiently with diffuse sunlight, without the need of volatile organic solvents that currently limit practical use in applications.  Complete immersion in Japanese society by spending four to eight weeks in Kyushu University will provide an opportunity to experience and understand the people, traditions and culture. The cultural and scientific exposure that the U.S. students will obtain from this international collaboration will be invaluable. Kyushu University is one of the top-ranked universities in Japan, and the cosmopolitan metropolis of Fukuoka is welcoming to foreigners. This opportunity is expected to enhance the global competitiveness of the participating students in the STEM workforce, and will be made available to qualified U.S. students, especially those underrepresented in science and engineering, by broadly reaching out to the California State university system, the Univ. of California system, and students attending professional conferences organized for example, by the American Chemical Society and Materials Research Society.

In this international collaboration, four U.S. undergraduate and/ or graduate participants per year will perform fundamental research on triplet-fusion based photon upconversion both in California and Japan. The fusion of molecular excited states with triplet character is the only method for directly upconverting photons from the sun. While these high photon upconversion quantum yields have been demonstrated in volatile organic solvents, they are generally lower in thin film due to poor triplet exciton diffusion. The U.S. students will be synthesizing and fabricating liquid or thin-films of semiconductor nanocrystals and molecular emitters organized in various hosts, including proteins, organogels and surfactants, to understand and control the diffusion of photogenerated triplet excitons. This project aims to use semiconductor nanocrystals to absorb light strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths to address one of the major limitations in molecular triplet photosensitizers. The hybrid nanomaterials will be designed to halt the spontaneous crystallization of the molecular emitter with nitrene crosslinking chemistry; increase triplet diffusion lengths in liquids or thin films with long-range order in covalent organic frameworks and establish a barrier to oxygen to prevent the quenching of spin-triplet excitons.

This Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the SoleMate Solutions' smart insole will optimize patient rehabilitation for lower extremity conditions. Currently, issues with patient compliance lead to unintended costs to the healthcare industry. Lower extremity conditions are especially prone to issues because of the lack of clarity on how to recover at home. This process is subject to confusion which can cause patients to either apply too much or too little weight during rehabilitation, leading to many complications. These can include malalignment of bone which requires additional treatment or even surgery. 15 million people experience lower extremity injuries each year and the rate of complications lead to approximately $12 billion in unintended costs. The SoleMate insole aims to resolve this issue by providing patients with real-time feedback to correct form by measuring weight applied while walking. This information is not only helpful for patients, but physicians are also informed on how compliant patients were during recovery. There are no other products that can track rehabilitation based on weightbearing. Furthermore, the applications for this technology extend past medicine. An insole that can accurately track how someone walks can be applied to sports and orthopedic research.

This I-Corps project is aimed for manufacturing a device that can accurately measure weightbearing while walking during an episode of care. Sensors placed in the insole are coupled with a patient-specific algorithm that generates a summary that patients can check on their smart phone. This information will also be integrated into a patient?s summary on recovery at the doctor?s office. Real-time feedback on how much weight a patient applies throughout the day can correct for form. From a clinician?s perspective, this information can be useful on tailoring future treatment to the individual. There are other research devices that can accurately measure how someone walks, but these devices are typically expensive and wired to a computer. Creating a wireless device allows for continual feedback and a more accurate picture of someone?s activity throughout the day. Lower extremity rehabilitation would be less confusing with a smart insole that can track form and activity.

"abstractText": "The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations."

Our goal is to train a cohort of early-stage chemistry and chemical engineering graduate students to the connecting M3 cycle consisting of synthesis (Make), innovative measurements (Measure) and system modeling and sustainable operation (Model), in the context of applied chemistry in Germany. This M3 cycle is critically important in modern chemistry as it represents the most effective way to achieve rapid advances in chemical synthesis and the understanding of chemical transformations, yet this cycle is not broadly implemented in the U.S. chemical science curriculum. The proposed educational excursion will train students to better understand the interrelationship between academia and industry, as well as intercultural differences that they will encounter in a global economy. We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.

Technical Abstract
Expert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Blümich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media."

The overarching goal of this project is to involve and train undergraduate and graduate student researchers from UCSB and other institutions in different scientific, academic, and international venues to develop a highly skilled, diverse and globally engaged workforce who can address energy challenges of today and the future. Three undergraduate students and four graduate students will travel to Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden) each year for 8-10 week long research experiences. UCSB graduate students taking part in the research experiences at Chalmers will be recruited based on collaborative research topics, working broadly in the area of materials chemistry for energy conversion and storage. Undergraduate students will be recruited from US colleges and universities to participate in the summer undergraduate IRES program, with particular focus on recruiting participation by women and underrepresented minorities. The international component of the research and program will provide students with cultural perspectives and the opportunity to develop a global network in science.
The scientific challenge of this IRES project is to design, create, and understand novel materials and materials systems that can capture, convert, and store energy. This will be accomplished through synergistic and complementary coupling of resources and expertise in state-of-the-art synthesis, simulation, characterization, and testing at UCSB, Chalmers University of Technology, and multi-user x-ray and neutron facilities in Sweden. IRES students will participate in collaborative research between UCSB and Chalmers University through international research visits focused on battery materials; magnetocalorics, thermoelectrics, and dynamic polymers for energy capture; and carbon and oxide-based materials for electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy storage.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable new and improved lateral flow assays (LFAs) through the development of hollow metal nanoparticles as highly sensitive color labels. LFAs are commonly used in environmental monitoring, food safety testing, and point-of-care clinical diagnostics (the most common example is the home pregnancy test). The company?s core technology will improve the performance of the active component in LFA devices, translating to faster and more accurate diagnoses, more timely treatment regimens, and decreased health care costs for patients and providers worldwide. These advantages should prove especially important in resource-constrained settings where access to established laboratories equipped with expensive instrumentation is cost- or time-prohibitive. Thus, the improvement and expansion of rapid, affordable, LFA point-of-care diagnostic platforms represent a critical need and will have broad impacts in public health on a global scale. Moreover, with the growing adoption of nanotechnology throughout industry, there is rapidly increasing demand for intentionally designed nanostructures in a wide range of applications ranging from chemical catalysis to optoelectronics. Securing a foothold in the LFA industry will establish the infrastructure necessary to diversify the company?s product distribution into other industries that could also benefit from the advantages of hollow metal nanoparticles.

This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for hollow metal nanoparticles. Hollow nanoparticles have substantial advantages over their solid counterparts, including lower mass per particle for reduced material costs, higher surface-area-to-volume ratio for increased loading, and enhanced plasmonic performance. The company?s primary technology is the highly uniform synthesis of hollow metal nanoparticles with predetermined dimensions, surface morphology, optical response, and metal composition. Currently, most conventional LFAs use 30-40 nm solid gold particles, which suffer from low capture rate and low visual contrast. In order to improve the sensitivity of these devices, we have developed more advanced nanostructures which will be captured more effectively and provide greater contrast. Implementing robust customer discovery will enable us to determine the extent of product customization that would be most useful to this target industry. Successfully making this determination and subsequently commercializing the company?s technology would enable LFAs with greater sensitivity, opening the door for platform expansion to previously undetectable diseases and toxins. Moreover, through the company?s immersion into customer discovery and business model canvas principles, we will become experts in the Lean LaunchPad methodology and can then apply this methodology to future target customer segments.

The project provides international research opportunities related to coastal zone sustainability to US graduate students in the geosciences. The project also trains these students in the processes required to formulate, design and conduct original research overseas, an essential skill for today?s scientists who must function effectively on multi-national teams and work on projects that are globally relevant. 

This project focuses on coastal zone research, covering the complex ecosystems extending from fresh water systems to near-shore ocean systems. These ecosystems face numerous challenges and offer significant research opportunities of global importance. The students will work with well-regarded Israeli researchers and will use the excellent facilities of the IUI located on the Gulf of Aqaba. A total of six students per year over three years (18 total students) will participate in this summer research program in collaboration with scientists from IUI. 

This project is somewhat unusual in that a clear research plan for the students is not defined at the outset. However, this is also a crucial strength of the project, since students will develop the skills needed to perform independent, globally oriented research. Students will apply by preparing their own proposal for a summer research project in Israel that complements their ongoing thesis work in the US. Students who are accepted will then further develop the idea in collaboration with the selected Israeli investigator over the course of a quarter-long planning course. The U.S. students will get first-hand experience in skills essential for their long term scientific success:  constructing scientific research questions that link local and international coastal zone sustainability issues,  initiating interactions with non-U.S. scientists, collaboratively designing and executing a research plan, dealing with logistics related to work overseas, communicating and disseminating results jointly with their collaborator, and maintaining long term relations with their international partners."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years. 

The intellectual merits of the I-Corps Site renewal project at UCF include the capture and curation of a deep understanding of (1) the processes, methodologies and programs for entrepreneurship education and technology commercialization, (2) Best practices for transitioning research from the bench top into the marketplace, (3) and distributing this knowledge to collaborators, partners, and affiliates throughout the NIN, and (4) development and adaptation of programs for specialty cohorts supporting local clusters and targeted populations. Additional knowledge and understanding will be gained through the collection of longitudinal data following I-Corps participants after they have completed the curriculum. 

UCF is an active and engaged partner in the Central Florida innovation ecosystem. The broader impacts from this project directly contribute to the broader community understanding of innovation-based economic development and the importance of research and commercialization. This is critically important to a community that is dependent on tourism and hospitality and the associated lower paying jobs in the region. Building on the initial successes of the UCF I-Corps Site program, successful commercialization of research and inventions generated at the leading research institutions and affiliate organizations in the region, this renewal project has the potential to significantly impact the regional economy. Further, with curriculum that effectively serves Hispanic populations, there is the potential to produce major social and economic impact on a national level. Florida has the third largest Hispanic population in the U.S., with nearly 25% of UCF student population and 34% of Florida business owners being of Hispanic origin, making this an ideal location to develop, deploy, and refine the curriculum."

Healthcare patient outcomes and experiences will improve with reductions in medication errors, misdiagnosis, and other inaccuracies that can cause harm to patients and create liability issues with healthcare providers.  Processes associated with acquiring electronic health data are often function slowly, incompletely, and often without the full consent of the patient or adequate metadata to track critical information required for treating a patient.  The solution developed here can potentially enable proper data correctness and address inconsistencies which can lead to better patient outcomes and improve legal liability framework.

This I-Corps project provides intellectual merits that will improve the healthcare information industry. This includes synthesis of mathematical models and algorithms that analyze data completeness and consistency. Specifically, this will lead to a hybrid machine learning approach that will utilize unsupervised learning to automatically classify various electronic health records as complete or incomplete, and supervised learning to confirm such classification and further grade the likelihood that the entered data is accurate and correct.  Furthermore, this will also lead to evolutions in applications of reinforcement learning supporting greater accuracy, and anomaly detection. Overall, this project will lead to improving the quality of healthcare delivery and innovations in supporting evolutions in data science.

Ceramics and Ceramic matrix composites have demonstrated promise in the quest for performance under hypersonic conditions related to sub-orbital and reusable space vehicles. This IRES will provide a 10-week summer session every year for 3 years, to enable 4 US students annually, both at the graduate and undergraduate levels, to acquire knowledge in manufacturing, testing and simulation of advanced material systems exhibiting durability in extreme environments. Through the program, students experience large-scale facilities at DLR Aerospace in Cologne, Germany, including materials manufacturing and testing systems to design and develop experimental samples. This experience offers joint participation of US and German researchers in synchrotron studies at the Argonne National Laboratory with mentorship from both German and US-based scientists. Students will gain a rare insight into the full cycle of emerging materials research. Research outcomes have long terms societal benefits in creating a new class of materials for next generation energy, propulsion and transportation needs. The educational broader impact of the international collaborative research is achieved through i) an exchange of knowledge of high resolution techniques in processing, experimentation and simulation ii) opportunities for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to experience collaborative research in highly advanced facilities focused on each expertise with mentoring from highly trained scientists as well as peer mentoring between graduate and senior undergraduate students, iii) a pre-trip German Engineering Exchange (GEEx) activity with local high school students (taking German language) teaching basic German Language in exchange for engineering activities organized by the participants. Research opportunities in Germany will be shared with the rising freshmen through this activity. 

Part 2
This IRES project facilitates international experiences for students, through collaborative research between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the University of Central Florida (UCF), in support of the search for materials that can sustain extreme physical and mechanical environments applicable to hypersonic and reusable space vehicles. DLR's expertise in advanced processing of high temperature ceramics and ceramic matrix composites will complement UCF's unique capability to capture the mechanics of these complex layered material systems directly, under operational and real environments. The research enables investigation of the strain evolution in these materials over thermal-mechanical or thermal gradient-mechanical cycles, crack propagation under extreme environments and effects of geometry on strain and damage propagation through in-situ synchrotron measurements conducted by the UCF and DLR researchers in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory. The results will enable fundamental knowledge on the mechanical properties and behavior of these materials with outcomes that have the potential to extend operational capacity and durability under high temperature."

This interdisciplinary partnership between the University of Central Florida and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology (FIDMT) in Ilmenau, Germany is focused on adaptive conversational avatars, the rapidly emerging field crossing computer engineering, computer science, education, communications, and social science.  Immediate applications of this research field include artificial intellegence and national security (including cyber-security), interactive robotics, improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children and elderly.
This project will place students from the University of Central Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke, the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany for each year of the grant period.
This research project is motivated by an ancient art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent, the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person. This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. 

Part 2
Storytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books. Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner, the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals.

Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

Through their initial Site grant, the University of Chicago served approximately 90 STEM teams, including innovative faculty, researchers, and students from the University of Chicago community and other Chicagoland institutions. Several of these teams were successful ? winning further grant funding, raising outside capital, hiring staff, and launching companies. Upon the renewal of their Site grant, the Polsky Center seeks to: 1) continue serving campus constituents, and 2) broadening access of these resources to underserved and underrepresented populations in the Chicagoland region whose universities do not currently provide access to Site resources. Through this goal, Polsky aims to increase economic development in Illinois and empower innovators to test their ideas.

The Polsky Center has been a recognized leader in the development and launch of ventures that create economic value, supporting an increasing number of companies launching from technical divisions, including: the Computation Institute, the Medical Center, and the Institute for Molecular Engineering. Additionally, the University of Chicago manages national laboratories, including the Department of Energy Labs Argonne and Fermi, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. The University of Chicago is committed to also supporting technology transfer from these institutions, which have received federal funding."

"abstractText": "The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

"abstractText": "Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is due to the zero-waste approach to resue spent coffee grounds (SCGs). This technology can potentially result in a more sustainable waste management practice. It can greatly reduce landfill costs for the municipalities and SCG generators. The technology will result in more resources conserved by generating value added materials and reduce the community?s carbon footprint. This I-Corps project will directly benefit the entrepreneurial leaders by allowing them to go out of the laboratory and make real world customer connections. This experience will better equip the PI with the mindset and skills to pursue commercial applications of her future research. This customer discovery process will provide the team with essential information on technology-market fit, thus paving the way of commercialization. This project may greatly promote the adoption of this environmentally friendly technology by the society. 

This I-Corps project is based on laboratory proven technology to reuse the whole parts of SCGs. The SCGs will be separated into two products, the lipid fraction as biofuels and the remaining solids as either biochar or a specialized activated carbon. A direct esterification process is used for lipid extraction, which also enhances the subsequent carbon reuse process with sulfur enrichment. Compared with the solvent extraction process used by others, our patent-pending process is more cost effective, efficient and environmentally friendly. The simplicity and low cost will promote its wide use, and thus effectively divert SCG from landfills and generate value added products that can be used locally.  Customer discovery is essential in understanding the product market fit, which will greatly facilitate technology commercialization.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will result in higher performing polymeric photonic materials (plastics which interact with light) which will have extensive application in consumer devices such as computers, cell phones, lighting units, telecommunications, cameras, and sensors.  Polymeric photonic materials are finding evermore application in devices due to their low weight, high-impact resistance, and ability to be fabricated into unique shapes/architectures, however, have paltry optical performance when compared to their heavier, costlier glass counterparts.  The material developed here combines the existing positive attributes of polymeric optical materials while offering significantly higher performance without large increases in price.

This I-Corps project will develop high optical quality crosslinked polymer networks with the unique ability to be remolded, reshaped, and repurposed when placed under the correct conditions without loss of mechanical integrity or optical properties.  Polymeric optical components (lenses, waveguides, etc.) are desirable over fragile and heavy glass counterparts, however, defects and birefringence (stresses which negatively interact with light) prevent polymers from being used for applications requiring high optical quality materials.  This proprietary technology allows for microscopic scrambling of chemical bonds to occur in the polymeric materials only when it is placed under certain conditions, effectively annealing out the aforementioned defects and birefringence in the polymer, giving high optical quality materials.  Current research is focused on taking this dynamic platform and placing it into commercially relevant resins that fabricate tough, robust, optically clear, high performance materials."

"abstractText": "This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of Connecticut (UConn).

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The University of Connecticut proposes to create Accelerate UConn, an NSF I-Corp Site, to strengthen its existing innovation ecosystem with entrepreneurial education, experiential learning and a business creation process that is based on the I-Corps model. Accelerate UConn (AU) is a joint effort of Technology Acceleration Partners (TAP) ­UConn's technology transfer, incubation and commercialization entity -and the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CCEI), which is responsible for much of UConn?s internal and external entrepreneurial education activities. 

As an NSF I-Corps site, AU will expand UConn's community of innovators and entrepreneurs and will aid in the transformation of UConn discoveries into products that benefit humanity and add to economic growth. 

Broader Impacts:
The proposed activity may significantly impact the preparedness of university talent for roles in technology-based, entrepreneurial enterprises and, as such, will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Connecticut and the nation. Connecticut has historically relied on well-established companies to support its economy, resulting in a dearth of entrepreneurial talent that has lead to a loss of innovative capacity. AU's activities will support the shift from dependence on large corporate employers to an entrepreneurially driven economy. As more startups begin to flourish as a result of AU's efforts, new jobs will be created and the career prospects of  graduates will be strengthened. 

On the national level, there is valid concern that losing our standing as the global leader in technology will result in economic contraction. AU?s activities may counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think beyond traditional academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of individuals to remain in science by becoming drivers of innovation within technology-based, entrepreneurial companies, which they help to create."

"abstractText": "The first stars, galaxies and black holes burst into existence only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, bringing light to the cosmos and setting in motion processes that built the Universe as we see it today. Many mysteries remain about these early epochs, but not for too much longer: new and upcoming facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are optimized to revolutionize our understanding of this time period, known as "Cosmic Dawn." The Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence (DAWN, established 2018), an international research center in Copenhagen, Denmark, brings together scholars whose interests span a broad range of observational and theoretical inquiries into Cosmic Dawn. Their expertise, together with Copenhagen's beautiful and enriching setting, make DAWN an ideal host for budding US scholars. We will create the DAWN-IRES Scholars Program to empower future generations of US scientists through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of visiting Copenhagen to immerse themselves into this vibrant international research center. The DAWN-IRES scholars will join a cohort of 7 student researchers in a stimulating 10-week science program that merges research using next-generation telescopes with life in a thousand-year-old city. The program's structure will encourage students to build learning communities within their cohorts, equipping them with practical research and communication skills. At the same time, the international exposure and access to cutting-edge resources will help maintain US leadership within the global astronomical community.

Students will lead observational and/or theoretical projects that contribute towards understanding some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: What caused the reionization of the Universe?  How do the first, massive galaxies form?  What is the origin of galaxy scaling relations? What quenches star formation in massive galaxies?  Over the next decade, the center's mission is to develop and test a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of the earliest galaxies through to the present day. The DAWN-IRES Scholars will join this thriving international research network, bridging the world class research performed by the US-based associate faculty coordinating this program with the DAWN permanent faculty and the local program coordinator.  The key learning goals of this international research experience include: (1) building a learning community to stimulate personal and academic growth, (2) developing effective scientific communication skills, and (3) performing globally competitive research addressing an open question in astrophysics.

The DAWN-IRES program is primarily designed to enhance the progress of science through a unique global educational training experience for a diverse cohort of US students.  The themes defining the broader impact of the program include diversity, training, dissemination, and community.  Through extensive proactive recruitment strategies (direct contact with faculty at minority-serving institutions, leveraging social media, widely circulating flyers, local announcements in STEM courses, and more), the PI will assemble diverse groups of scholars to stimulate excellence and innovation.  The program incorporates a wide range of professional development activities that are focused on advancing scientific communication skills (e.g., weekly seminars, hack days, oral presentations abroad and stateside).  The students will also build professional research toolkits, including learning programming, data analysis and presentation techniques.  Dissemination of research will occur through the DAWN-IRES Scholars Symposium at the end of each summer in Copenhagen, together with a presentation at the students' local institutions and the national American Astronomical Society meeting.  Working with the Center for Excellence in Teaching at UConn, the assessment strategy of DAWN-IRES will be tailored to the learning goals of the program.

The research projects will come from a wide range of subjects in nuclear physics including detector development, data analysis and software development.   A particular emphasis will be made to recruit women and minority participants from institutions in New England and Southern Virginia. This program will enable the students to develop collaborative thinking and communication skills in an international working environment, establish a global network with foreign scientists, and gain insight into a future career.  This program emerges from the beliefs that international collaboration will advance scholarship by stimulating global perspectives, and that students must be prepared for their careers in the increasingly globally engaged working environment of the future.

A major focus of modern nuclear physics concerns how protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei are made of quarks and gluons, the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics. Modern studies of the nucleon structure are conducted at large-scale nuclear research facilities by large collaborations with a significant international component. This project supports US student participation in the ongoing research activities of the hadron physics group at the Institut de Physique Nucléaire d?Orsay (IPN- Orsay).  The planned projects include (1) detection efficiency studies of a neutron detector, (2) development of a nuclear fragment detector, (3) studies of the particle channeling via bent crystals, (4) performance studies of MWPC (Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber) and GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors, (5) performance studies of diamond detectors, and (6) software development of 3-D modeling of the nucleon structure.  US student participation in these projects supports the development of a globally trained competitive workforce at the forefront of nuclear physics."

This I-Corps Site will expand this institution's entrepreneurial ecosystem that includes: training opportunities based on lean startup methods; improved physical facilities and service offerings provided by their Venture Development Center; and, an extensive startup support network of engaged entrepreneurs, investors, business service providers, community partners and others. This Site will increase the quantity and velocity of activities aimed at bringing new technologies into the marketplace. The University of Delaware?s Venture Development Center serves as a hatchery/incubator for student startups and will do likewise for I-Corps teams. 

This Site is likely to impact the ecosystem of the georgraphical region where this institution is located. In the past, Delaware benefitted from the presence of several large, hi-tech employers But, lingering effects from the economic downturn reduced the state's social and economic wellbeing. Consequently, an increase in startup activity, and the associated creation of new jobs, will serve to improve the economic wellbeing of Delaware and the surrounding region.  Broader impacts resulting from participation in the I-Corps Program will also include improved educational outcomes and competitiveness for STEM students, and stronger partnerships between academia and industry. The possibility of receiving funding and joining an I-Corps team may incentivize STEM students to learn about innovation and entrepreneurship by participating in existing training opportunities, thereby improving their educational outcomes and competitiveness. Stronger partnerships between academia and industry will result from interactions between I-Corps team members and prospective industry customers as well as the formation of I-Corps teams that will attempt to commercialize industry technology."

The project aims to reconnect people with the way that food is grown in a way that helps them and the planet. This connection is critical to helping people make healthier food choices. By enabling people to grow their own food, we also connect them with the reality of seasons and enable them to make choices that are better for the environment.  The project will also provide a platform for student engagement with entrepreneurship, product development, and engineering design. Students are a part of and have shaped smart garden automation from the beginning, and the team plans to continue to work with academic institutions to maintain this relationship. Finally, the NSF I-Corps program will help this team develop the skills necessary to create value from ideas. This learning curve will be critical as the team moves forward on this project, and will better prepare them to be both leaders and mentors for others in the future. 

This I-Corps project is about a smart gardening system that lets gardeners grow more plants with less work. By harnessing recent technical advancements in low-power wireless communication, moisture sensors, and networked device protocols, the system makes gardening more convenient and accessible. When paired with a smart phone or web interface, this system has the potential to better enable a generation of gardeners and lead to healthier people, more efficient water usage and storm-water management, and a lower average carbon footprint for a given person's diet. The intellectual merit in this project is demonstrated by the fact that there are no existing systems on the market that can do all of things that this project's invention is set to do. The NSF I-Corps program will help the project team recognize the market segments for any potential commercial product.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an enabling technology for the cost-competitive production of biolubricant base-oils with better performance using 100% renewable carbon to meet growing customer pressure for sustainable products. The produced environmentally-acceptable products have a total over $60 billion global market and applications in industrial machinery, commercial and consumer automotives, grease, personal care products, turbines, transformers, aviation engines and machinery, marine vessels, hydropower production machinery, and others. Successful commercialization of this technology and products will bring multiple societal and commercial benefits. First, the designer biolubricants, guided by molecular simulation modeling, will bring market transformation for efficient and durable products.  Second, the technology will bring feedstock flexibility for new and "greener" products innovation by utilizing the nation's abundant carbon neutral feedstocks; thus, addressing environmental eco-system concerns. Third, it will improve rural economies by utilizing the feedstocks and resources that are available in those areas. Fourth, educational benefits are an integral element of our proposed work, as it will provide opportunities to train technicians and early career researchers.

This I-Corps project will gather customers' feedback and establish the commercial feasibility of this patent-pending technology on energy-efficient and atom-economic production of biolubricant base-oils with tailored molecular architectures and tunable specifications. Initial specifications, techno-economic analysis, and customer's feedback suggest that the products are cost-competitive and suitable for current high performance applications. Bio-degradability, and tunable specifications of the products will offer significant competitive advantages to the market. We will gather more customers' feedback through the proposed I-Corps National program to gain more market insight for products. Especially, we will (1) evaluate market gaps and customers' desire for next generation products, (2) validate the market entry strategy, (3) analyze competitions and competitive advantages for our products, (4) analyze and validate value-propositions and their fit to the market need, and (5) analyze the market price of competitors' products. The outcome of this market research will significantly advance the commercialization of our products and technology.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the increased mobility, and thereby, social integration for people with ankle control deficit. Mobility is associated with functional independence and participation in society. Sufficient ankle control plays a vital role in mobility. A significant portion of populations with neuromuscular disorders, such as children with cerebral palsy (CP) and post-stroke survivals, live with insufficient ankle control. Our design, DEAFO, is a soft mechanized brace to help these individuals to walk easier and longer. DEAFO will provide assistance and correction about the ankle while preventing discomfort, to promote mobility and improve the quality of life of the users.  The project will first focus on the CP population (~700,000 in US), which is the most common motor disorder in children. CP's total economic burden, in direct and indirect costs, is $11.5 billion per year, in the US alone. A significant portion of this cost consists of assistive devices and physical training, needed due to insufficient ankle control. Hence, DEAFO will aim to provide both ankle assistance and physical training to promote motor recovery, which potentially decreases these costs over time. The company's ultimate goal is to expand DEAFO applications to post-stroke population (~8 million in US). 

This I-Corps project will be the first light-weight, noiseless, soft, and mechanized ankle foot orthoses (AFO), that deploy dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. Thus, it is called DEAFO. Increased chance of falls, and inefficient walking speed, are major consequences of ankle-control deficit. Although this is a common disorder in a population of 8 to 10 million, the status of care for this pathology, usually, is a rudimentary, bulky, rigid uncomfortable AFO. Furthermore, the none-mechanized AFOs hold the ankle fixed at specific angles, and cause secondary problems, such as disuse atrophy of the muscles. DEAFO will be mechanized by dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. The novel DE actuators are soft, lightweight, compact, and acoustically noiseless, with muscle-like behaviors, which is benchmark tested in the company's lab. The softness and noiseless operation of these artificial muscles will substantially improve the comfort and natural feel of the device in comparison with other mechanized AFOs. Unlike most mechanized AFOs, the controller that will drive the artificial muscles in the device has been specifically developed and evaluated for pathological walking and showed 100% detection reliability in children with CP. This project can revolutionize the status of care for ankle-control deficit.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to change the way vehicles are driven to save energy, which will reduce fuel consumption and pollution near public roadways.  The first iteration of the technology will be in the form of recommendations made to drivers to affect velocity at different points along a route.  With the recent advancement to autonomous driver system implementation, this technology can be applied by directly interconnecting with the automated control systems rather than working through driver recommendations.  The safety of highways and all roadways will be enhanced with the system to recommend a maximum velocity prior to reaching road curves, preventing tipping and sliding.  Furthermore, less maintenance and longer lasting parts on vehicles such as brake replacements, tire replacements, and engine and transmission work will be needed.  This will benefit all of society in the form of reduced transportation cost.  

This I-Corps project is the result of studies done in the field of control systems. Specifically, control systems which optimize velocity to minimize energy consumption over a driving route through the implementation of dynamic programming.  The technology uses vehicle characteristics such as mass, air drag coefficients, and motor efficiency, as well as altitude and heading to determine the speed profile which is a minimum for a given route, while still adhering to local speed laws.  The technical results which the project is based stems from simulations done in Matlab concerning all these parameters in different situations and environments.  The initial simulations have shown a 16% energy saving for city driving in a scenario.  The amount of energy saving will be highly situational and will likely vary widely depending on the vehicle studied and circumstances.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a biological measure of Parkinsons disease (PD) which is extremely valuable in determining treatment strategies for PD patients and in drug development against PD. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States with treatment costs that exceeded $14.4 billion in 2010 and projected to double by 2040. Effective treatment of PD requires reliable early diagnosis of PD, however no objective test for definitive diagnosis of PD currently exists. Current diagnosis is based on outward symptoms like tremors, slow movement, rigid muscle, brain imaging and usually requires multiple visits with neurology specialists to avoid misdiagnosis. In fact, a 2013 study determined that the direct cost of diagnosis for a new PD patient on average amounts to $7,322 and with 60,000 new diagnosis of PD made every year in US, the market of PD diagnosis is estimated to be a minimum $0.4 billion. A new diagnostic approach for early stage of Parkinson's disease (PD) will have a tremendous impact on the prevention and treatment of PD by providing a stratification strategy of patients and increase the success in clinical trial of PD treatment. 

This I-Corps project is based on an understanding of the role of protein homeostasis in the cell and developing tools and techniques to decipher these pathways. PD is a neurological disease with the key hallmark of large deposits of Lewy bodies, an amalgam of aggregated proteins, in the affected motor neurons. Literature reports have identified certain biomarkers in Lewy bodies that have unique signature of post-translational modification which can cross the blood brain barrier. This project leverages techniques that identify signatures on the biomarker in PD blood samples and utilize tools that recombinantly generate biomarkers and develop antibodies against them, which will allow development of a test kit for early detection of PD non-invasively.

This IRES project will support US students and provide international education, training and research in marine geochemistry and carbon cycling in a tropical estuary (Douala Estuary) in the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, West Africa. During this study, faculty and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound? 1in Cameroon. Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments. Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.

This IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model. Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research topics and graduate student theses. A goal of our IRES program is to attract underrepresented minority students and mentor them to develop self-confidence, independent and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in a research and in careers in the geosciences. By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

Carbon in estuaries are an integral part of the global carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date, there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period, US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping) that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium) affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic pollution in the Douala Estuary increases bio-productivity in the water column and sediments, alters the cycling of carbon and increases the flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. 

By interacting with Cameroonian peers, the US students will enrich their cultural experience, build personal and professional networks and establish relationships that will form the core of future international research collaborations. Finally, the results of student projects will provide scientific input that is useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection of estuarine resources.

The prevalence of autism has increased by 15% in 2014. Now, 1 in 59 children born in the US has ASD. This translates to roughly 5.5 million individuals in the US who are less likely to go to college or find a job after high school. Our user-friendly, discreet device can help affected individuals gain independence and create a supportive learning or working environment for them. Pre-emptive meltdown detection and care devices are virtually non-existent in the current marketplace. As the first to enter the market at an affordable price point, we expect to lead and spawn derivative products. Beyond autism, our platform technology can be utilized to push data to a healthcare professional, catalyzing informed and personalized preventive care. Other conceivable application is monitoring compliance and measuring the effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises for muscle engagement of stroke patients. Our innovation also has the potential to reach and assist those affected by other types of anxiety disorders. It can help people become more informed about their own mental health, intervene, and lead healthier lives. 

This I-Corps project involves wearable technology for predicting, detecting, tracking, and mitigating meltdowns for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have developed a biometric sensing suite comprising two components: The hardware portion consists of a detachable, water-resistant core unit for biosignal filtering, processing, and transmission as well as machine washable sensors that can be embedded into apparel; The software portion consists of our proprietary machine learning models for determination of when a meltdown is to occur, alerting the parent or caregiver of a high risk of a meltdown, and an assessment of mitigation techniques afterwards. Our innovation will advance autism research, as the technology has the potential to open the doors to a better understanding of behavioral phenotypes. Being able to tell what a non-verbal child is feeling can pave the way for more efficient and productive lessons for social/education development as well as broader phenotypical research. The assessment feature of our product will lead to the improvement of mitigation techniques for meltdowns. gaia's competitive advantage is in its pre-emptive nature of care. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated, and a beta prototype will be complete by the end of Summer 2018.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "Interdisciplinary Research in Korea on Applied smart systems (IRiKA) for Undergraduate Students will provide a cohort of five US undergraduate students per year with the opportunity to conduct research for 8 weeks at Korea's top-ranked universities with state-of-the-art research facilities: Seoul National University, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and Ewha Womans University. Over the lifetime of this 3-year project, 15 students will participate. Students from underrepresented groups will be recruited. The unifying research theme of IRiKA is smart systems with the subtopics of sensors, emerging electronics, and materials and process development. In addition to lab work and weekly cohort research meetings, IRiKA students will visit Korea's government research institutions and global leaders in the tech industry such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai. The distinctive features of IRiKA are: 1) A cohort experience bringing the US participants together; 2) Vetted and structured professional development program tailored for both US students and Korean mentors; and 3) Availability of follow-on collaborative projects in US and Korea to facilitate a sustained global network of mentorship. Students will gain formative research skills and learn how smart systems brings together interdisciplinary technological solutions for manufacturing, healthcare, energy, safety and security, transportation, and logistics. The international aspect of the IRiKA will help students recognize their place in the global scientific community. The participants will present their work at their home institutions upon their return and will be incentivized to publish in a peer-reviewed journal or present at a conference for broader dissemination. 

Interdisciplinary Research in Korea on Applied smart systems (IRiKA) for Undergraduate Students will engage students in interdisciplinary research, help them develop a global perspective on collaboration, and motivate them to pursue a career in STEM research. Efforts will be made to attract students underrepresented in STEM and/or with limited STEM research opportunities. IRiKA takes a scaffolded mentorship approach that fosters students' growth from a relatively dependent status to as independent a status as their competence warrants. Smart systems incorporate sensing, actuation, wireless connectivity, and machine learning. Examples of research projects that individual students will conduct during 8 weeks in Korea include: Development of an air-borne particle sensing system for health monitoring and air quality monitoring; Development of miniature and micro power generation systems to enable autonomous sensor systems; and Development of a light-weight, flexible point-of-care device consisting of microfluidic channels and reduced graphene oxide-based biosensors. Upon return to the US, students will be able to engage in follow-on projects in areas such as convergent IoT systems at University of Florida's NSF I/UCRC Multi-functional Integrated Systems Technology (MIST) center and wearable sensor systems at Louisiana State University.

"abstractText": "This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in field-based ecology and conservation research in the southern Africa country of Swaziland. The project will use mentoring, teamwork and innovative research to train students to address some of the planet's most pressing conservation issues. Students will work with American and African scientists to study the integration of human livelihoods and needs for agricultural production with the need to maintain the diverse and vigorous ecosystems that allow human communities to thrive. Working internationally in Swaziland, students will first gain an understanding of regional cultures, natural history, ecological theory and research techniques. Students will then spend their summer conducting independent research projects. Over the course of the project student research projects will examine how recently converted agricultural lands may alter wildlife communities and the health of entire ecosystems. As global biodiversity continues to decline and agricultural landscapes increase, this project will help us understand how to maintain biodiversity, healthy ecosystems, and human livelihoods. Additionally, the program will produce a new generation of scientists who will spread their newly found knowledge to local and global audiences and be well prepared to face our planet's growing conservation challenges.

Global conservation efforts must embrace agricultural landscapes, because agriculture has and will continue to play a dominant role in shaping land-use practices. Nonetheless, there is only a limited understanding of how agricultural landscapes alter biodiversity and ecosystems? ability to provide resources for humans (ecosystem services). One major hypothesis for balancing agricultural production with biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Swazi and American scientists will work with students to understand the role of heterogeneity on faunal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. One cohort of students will relate variation in the distribution of faunal communities to patterns in landscape heterogeneity. A second cohort of students will test the mechanisms that drive faunal community changes in agriculturally dominated landscapes. A final cohort of students will examine how landscape heterogeneity and faunal communities influence ecosystem functions."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project facilitate the design and operation of electromagnetic telemetry for underground wireless communication in oilfield measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD). The performance of an electromagnetic telemetry system is heavily dependent on electrical properties of the underground formation, as well as the deployment of downhole and surface antennas. Rigorous electromagnetic full wave simulations are critical in design, development, and deployment of an electromagnetic telemetry system for a drilling job. The modeling software package will potentially be the first product on the market with the capability of providing efficient 3D simulations of electromagnetic telemetry systems in complicated underground environments. Besides the oil and gas industry, electromagnetic telemetry can also be used in other important areas such as CO2 sequestration, deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste, and geothermal energy exploration.

This I-Corps project explores the market potential of a 3D electromagnetic telemetry modeling tool for the oil and gas industry and other areas involving drilling activities. A realistic electromagnetic telemetry system is an extremely multiscale structure, and rigorously modeling such a system is beyond the capabilities of available commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The proposed product is based on the recent advancement of computational electromagnetics algorithms using 3D integral equations with a novel coated thin wire model to simulate the metallic drill string and borehole environment in layered formation. The product as a modeling software can be several orders more accurate than existing commercial simulation tools for the analysis of electromagnetic telemetry systems. The goal of this I-Corps team is to investigate the market potential of this technology and related product in the oilfield and other relevant applicable areas."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of semiconductor devices for electronic, photonic, and energy applications. For example, the proposed innovation will bring 40% total cost reduction in light-emitting diodes (LED) chip/die manufacturing, which will provide a faster route for the energy-efficient LEDs to become a dominant lighting source. The innovation will also offer a new device platform for electric power conversion and switching in electric vehicles and smart-grid systems, which means significant benefits in energy saving and greenhouse-gas emission reduction. Hence, the proposed innovation will facilitate the rapid development of next-generation green device technology that can readily be applied to the real-world systems. Furthermore, the flexible material platforms will enable not only mechanically flexible devices for the applications of portable, wearable, and implantable systems, but also new devices with additional functionality for more versatile applications beyond just flexible devices. The new transformative technologies stemming from this project will help U.S. semiconductor manufacturers cope with global challenges and win in the competitive international markets. Therefore, the new platform will contribute to consolidating the U.S. position as a technology and market leader by strategically strengthening the innovation ecosystem of the semiconductor technology.

This I-Corps project proposes a promising replacement for single-crystalline wafer substrates of semiconductor devices by offering a new mechanically-flexible low-cost substrate. The objective of the project is to deliver commercially available low-cost, high-crystalline-quality, and flexible tape substrates to be employed as a new platform of photonic and electronic semiconductor devices. To accomplish the objective, the team will develop a new substrate consisting of flexible metal tape and a single-crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor thin film by an invented direct deposition technique. This method also enables the roll-to-roll and large-scale continuous production of high-quality semiconductor materials. The developed GaN/metal tape will to serve as the substrate for the fabrication of LEDs, as an initial target of the innovative technology, and other semiconductor devices. The result will be flexible inorganic LEDs with high efficiency and application versatility at a fraction of the cost of current solid-state lighting sources. The new product, while it is a potentially disruptive technology, has not been deployed in the device market with various products and applications. Therefore, understanding of business development will be critical. The team will perform customer survey and business model development via investigation of value proposition and customer discovery.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a lead enrichment kit that can allow fast detection of lead in water with low cost and low detection limit. Lead contamination in drinking water is a threat to human beings. Due to its health concern, the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has set an action level of 15 µg/L for lead in tap water. Considering the great threat of lead to health even with low concentrations, it is necessary to have lead measurements in water at a regular basis. The proposed project aims to commercialize an inexpensive kit which would allow fast lead detection in water with low detection limit to meet Lead and Copper Rule (15 ppb). The kit provides two main benefits to customers: a lower cost ($4) than current kit ($11) for lead detection which meets Lead and Copper Rule and convenience for field sample measurements.

This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial adoption of our inexpensive lead enrichment kit for lead detection. Interviews will be conducted to help identify the potential customers and the market needs, evaluate the commercialization feasibility of the new technology, and optimize the technology to meet the demand of targeted customers. Inspired by findings from our current NSF-project, special enrichment kit was designed to accumulate Pb from water, allowing quick detection of lead in water with low concentrations using the inexpensive detection kit. Additionally, the proposed work will provide the basis for future development and commercialization of new enrichment kits to detect other aqueous contaminants in water with low detection limits.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on maximizing resources for frost defense, reducing yield loss, improving quality, supporting decision-making, and reducing frost management cost for grapes and stone fruits.  Cold periods and frost episodes are still one of the worst enemies of grape and stone fruit production worldwide.  Grape and orchard production are highly linked to climatic conditions, making sub-seasonal weather variability and its connections to climate change a challenging issue for this economic sector. Growers may presently deploy fossil fuel heaters, sprinkler systems, the downward draft from helicopters and wind machines to fight spring frost damage. These methods are usually costly, some create environmental concerns, and in many cases they may be limited by water availability and area coverage.  Altering timing of bud break stages that are susceptible to frost injury appears to be a viable alternative to cope with current and emerging challenges of climate change. The proposed I-Corp program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of an end-to-end solution. The innovation combines a bioactive, non-toxic biodegradable encapsulation technology (spray) that alters internal grapevine physiology and promotes bud break delay. A predictive analytic system provides recommendations to make informed decisions about frost risk management.
 
This I-Corps project is based on a series of studies that have combined pruning management, biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, and resistance to cold injury.  In addition, the project combines this knowledge with an analytic data platform (software) that will analyze plant development as a function of environmental temperature (phenology), topographic and soil data, at the farm level.  Combination with global and regional patterns of climate patterns will aid understanding climate variability at high spatial and temporal scale. This platform will allow better prediction for decision making at the vineyard and orchard level to reduce some of the most significant challenges associated with prediction reliability about bud break and risk of frost.  Moreover, this predictive analytic system will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools and services to support decision-making to adapt growing practices, and to preserve sustainability due to already observed and worsening climate change impacts.  The I-Corp process will also be used to refine our understanding of customer value, willingness to pay and the cost of the best current alternatives.

These capabilities range from platforms to improve user access to manufacturing resources to enterprise visibility platforms, supply network management systems, and cloud technology-driven manufacturing marketplaces/exchanges. This project fosters local innovation by enabling networks of easily accessible maker labs and other manufacturing resources. The project can also potentially provide economic development agencies a tool for assessing local manufacturing capability and capacity as well as measuring manufacturing activity through analysis of the in-flow and out-flow of transactions in the system.

This I-Corps project creates a cloud platform to provide manufacturing resources with a secure network presence. The project implements a kernel based on a resource-transaction model for manufacturing resources, and surrounds it with services to enable several features, including:  a) Network visibility of its capabilities, availability, configuration and state;  b) Transaction services, including queue management, calendar, scheduler and transaction processing for initiating and executing jobs;  c) User services for authenticating users and managing access and privileges on resources;  d) IoT services for gathering and manipulating data streams originating at a resource, and secure distribution to authenticated end-points;  e) Connectivity to a curated store of cloud software applications for enhancing its visibility and usability to broad classes of users.  With these services and its use of well-established shop-floor connectivity protocols, this platform simplifies the complex tasks of creating and managing cyber-physical manufacturing networks of interacting manufacturing resources or internal/external manufacturing clouds.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to bring more usable technology to elderly populations to help them age with greater independence.  Specifically, existing in-home robots could assist a broader cohort of elderly users if the robots were easier to understand and use.  This is an especially timely opportunity as the elderly population is quickly growing in the United States. Elderly users need a robot that can express many internal states through external features, especially in an intuitive and interactive way. Choreographers and theater artists recognize how to convey narrative through context (set), movement (choreography), and commands (dialogue), therefore bringing a special expertise beyond typical product design processes.  Marrying this expertise with robotic hardware development has the potential to produce a significant transformation in how aging adults relate to and take advantage of technology in their homes.  

This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a three-part design methodology that has been developed to layer robotic systems with greater expressiveness and understandable features. This method 1) creates systems with appropriate expressive bandwidth to communicate internal state to human viewers through motion profiles, 2) helps users understand how to interact with robotic systems through character-driven narrative, and 3) predicts affective responses to these systems, across multiple contexts. Initial results indicate that trust and acceptance of in-home technology can be facilitated with low-cost, simple hardware like LEDs, off-the-shelf servo motors, improved how-to literature, and context-based behavior, with existing, low-cost robot hardware. For example, something as simple as a heart rate monitor has opaque, hard to interpret monitors, confusing multiple-step procedures, and an ominous beeping. This novel approach adds a customizable expressive layer to an existing device like this, creates a character-driven narrative about how the device works, and uses theatrical context which may improve user adoption via priming.

If it can be widely disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests for cancer.

The I-Corps project is focused on a new generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles, called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs, so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market.  Outcomes have been validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics settings."

Large-scale data acquisition, integration, analysis, and visualization using data-enabled information technologies will accelerate the dissemination of knowledge, experience, and shared resources (e.g., technology, equipment, and people) among communities and partners.  The key element of the project is a new cyber platform, the Upper Mississippi Information System (UMIS), which will provide water quality data within a rich spatio-temporal hydrologic context.  The UMIS directly addresses three of the Grand Challenges for Engineering identified by the National Academy of Engineering: i) provide access to clean drinking water; ii) manage the nitrogen cycle; and iii) engineer the tools of scientific discovery.  The UMIS will immediately begin facilitating data access, integration, and scientific discovery for water quality challenges in the UMRB. 

UMIS will offer internet-based open access to water quality information in its meteorological, hydrological, and geographical context, providing almost endless potential benefits for stakeholders.  For example, the experimental design of the UMIS will enable researchers to study spatial scaling, efficiency of various land use and agricultural practices to improve water quality, and the impact of climate change on land management and water quality.  Decision-makers, producers, and extension staff will be able to assess the relative efficacy of local (e.g., best management practices) versus system-level (e.g., state programs) solutions designed to reduce pollution, optimize the use of resources, and evaluate tradeoffs among competing objectives.  For all stakeholders, the UMIS will support partnerships and collaborations, increase dissemination of information about a critical natural resource to empower stakeholders at all levels, and set new standards in the communication of scientific data.

"abstractText": "The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

This award received co-funding from the Math and Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS) Division of Materials Research (DMR)."

"abstractText": "IRES Water Quality and Household Energy in Post-Earthquake Nepal: Long Term Protection of Community Health

Non-technical description

This IRES award brings together a diverse community of researchers and students from the United States and Nepal. In addition to working directly with local and international scientists, U.S. students will communicate to other undergraduate and graduate students through blogging about international research experience. Participants will also develop education materials, with help from local collaborators, to help inform community members in host countries. Upon return to their home institution, students will present their results through professional seminars and scientific publications. The students trained by this proposed program will be the future leaders of an elite international development workforce diminishing the impact of infectious disease on human health by nurturing the interaction of persons of different disciplines and skill sets to meet water, sanitation, and household energy needs worldwide.

Technical description

This U.S. - Nepal international research experience for students (IRES) project supports partnership between researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), the Environment and Public Health Organization, Nepal (ENPHO), the Center for Rural Technology Nepal (CRT-N), the Institute of Engineering, Nepal (IOE) and the Nepal Department of Health Services. Over a three-year period, this program will engage three U.S. undergraduate and three U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of eighteen participants, at multiple research sites in Nepal to study the aftermath of natural disaster like earthquake on microbial water quality compounded with sanitation practices. Following training and research preparation at UIUC, students will travel to Nepal, where they will be co-mentored by professors and researchers from the partner institutes. Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementation of field strategies for drinking water sampling in the affected areas; interviewing local people to understand the sanitation practices and the sustainability of relief efforts; and data collection on waterborne illnesses. Following each portion of fieldwork and sample processing in Kathmandu, participants return to UIUC to prepare collected samples for metagenomics, 16S and 18S sequencing, qPCR and bioinformatics analysis. These will be studied to identify opportunistic pathogens in collected water sample, and patterns of presence with different sanitation practices. Results will provide new insights on the risks of outbreak of diarrheal diseases after extreme natural events in developing world, and how human practices may increase or decrease these risks."

This is a proposal to establish an I-Corps Site at the University of Iowa.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The University of Iowa's (UI) I-Corps Site accelerates commercialization of technologies developed by UI faculty, students and community-based entrepreneurs and has invested in campus-wide infrastructure to foster innovation and technology commercialization. Core university entrepreneurship and technology commercialization operating units are closely aligned to ensure effective and rapid implementation of the UI I-Corps program. The UI has strong working relationships with external stakeholders for identifying experienced entrepreneurial leaders and mentors and securing financial capital from angel investors, venture capitalists and public sector programs to support UI I-Corps teams. 

The establishment of a UI I-Corps program significantly improves the campus' entrepreneurial eco-system by providing funding for new strategic investments in entrepreneurship education and support while leveraging existing commercialization activities.

At the core of the UI I-Corps program is entrepreneurial training; UI Venture School is an entrepreneurial training program based on the LeanLaunch Pad and Business Model Canvas. The UI offers 6-8 entrepreneurial educational programs annually, serving a minimum of 30 commercialization teams. In addition to training, the university launches 1) several business and technical support initiatives for I-Corps teams including the Summer Accelerator-a 90-day new venture launch program, 2) UI ProtoLabs-a prototype development program, 3) UI Ventures-a comprehensive technical and business development initiative, 4) UI Mentoring-a mentoring program connecting UI faculty and students to entrepreneurs, investors and technical experts, and 5) a SBIR/STTR grant development assistance program.  

Broader Impacts:
The UI I-Corps program incorporates mechanisms that may demonstrate the potential for how universities can successfully build a campus-wide, interconnected entrepreneurial ecosystem through interdisciplinary education and innovation, collaboration with colleges, centers, and research units, and partnerships with the private sector. UI I-Corps program is expected to: increase the number of UI startup companies; intensify interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty, students, entrepreneurs, investors and private sector companies; expand the entrepreneurial management talent of UI faculty and student entrepreneurs; and support the development and commercialization of new technologies designed to solve significant societal challenges.  

In addition, female entrepreneurs and female led startup companies is the focus of the UI I-Corps project. Startup companies led by female CEOs and CTOs represent a small fraction of entrepreneurs. The goal of the BI is to increase the number of female entrepreneurs on campus to be equal to their male counterpart within 5 years. Key elements of the BI approach include: 1) targeted grant funding for Gap and startup activities for female entrepreneurs, 2) one-on-one mentoring that pairs successful female entrepreneurs with each new female led startup, 3) formal recognition of accomplishments, grants and awards by female entrepreneurs, 4) bringing successful hi-tech female entrepreneurs to campus for publicized seminars and one-on-one sessions, 5) developing a network of female entrepreneurs for support, feedback and social connections, and 6) instituting an entrepreneurial leave of absence with special emphasis for female entrepreneurs."

"abstractText": "This project will develop a cyberinfrastructure framework to facilitate research on the efficient management of agricultural practices and their impact on water resources in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB).  Large-scale data acquisition, integration, analysis, and visualization using data-enabled information technologies will accelerate the dissemination of knowledge, experience, and shared resources (e.g., technology, equipment, and people) among communities and partners.  The key element of the project is a new cyber platform, the Upper Mississippi Information System (UMIS), which will provide water quality data within a rich spatio-temporal hydrologic context.  The UMIS directly addresses three of the Grand Challenges for Engineering identified by the National Academy of Engineering: i) provide access to clean drinking water; ii) manage the nitrogen cycle; and iii) engineer the tools of scientific discovery.  The UMIS will immediately begin facilitating data access, integration, and scientific discovery for water quality challenges in the UMRB. 

UMIS will offer internet-based open access to water quality information in its meteorological, hydrological, and geographical context, providing almost endless potential benefits for stakeholders.  For example, the experimental design of the UMIS will enable researchers to study spatial scaling, efficiency of various land use and agricultural practices to improve water quality, and the impact of climate change on land management and water quality.  Decision-makers, producers, and extension staff will be able to assess the relative efficacy of local (e.g., best management practices) versus system-level (e.g., state programs) solutions designed to reduce pollution, optimize the use of resources, and evaluate tradeoffs among competing objectives.  For all stakeholders, the UMIS will support partnerships and collaborations, increase dissemination of information about a critical natural resource to empower stakeholders at all levels, and set new standards in the communication of scientific data.

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

A typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The goal of the University of Louisville (UofL) I-Corps Site program is to integrate and leverage existing commercialization infrastructure and capabilities as a collaborative effort between the Office of Executive Vice President for Research and Innovation (EVPRI), College of Business' Forcht Center for Entrepreneurship (Forcht Center) and the STEM programs to establish a sustainable program for the discovery and commercialization of STEM innovations and stimulate regional economic development. 

The UofL I-Corps Site team will recruit and engage STEM researchers and students to facilitate and accelerate the translation of emerging technologies into commercial products by providing training and support at all stages of the entrepreneurial discovery process. Recruited students and researchers participate in an in-depth entrepreneurship education program, based on Stanford's Lean LaunchPad process, conducted by the Forcht Center and the EVPRI through Nucleus: Kentucky Innovation Center (Nucleus). 

The proposed program implements an Innovation Discovery Grants mechanism ($1,000 - $3,000) to support entrepreneurial teams in: 1) utilizing the new UofL Institute for Product Realization to develop proof of concept and prototypes for promising product ideas based on scientific and entrepreneurial merit; 2) customer discovery; 3) additional entrepreneurial training; and/or 4) traveling to consult with potential clients or experts. 

The vision of the program at the University of Louisville is to develop a cadre of well-trained, entrepreneurially oriented researchers and graduates who can effectively evaluate the commercial potential of new innovations and more expediently develop them as the drivers of new business development in Louisville, the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the region.  

Broader Impact:
This project has the potential to contribute to Kentucky's high tech industries, particularly in the areas of science and technology. The UofL I-Corps Site will provide a fertile environment for STEM entrepreneurial discovery and business development, which will stimulate the creation and growth of new, high-tech industries and higher paying jobs, while at the same time develop the entrepreneurial infrastructure of the state. 

From an educational perspective, this program will implement and evaluate a model for training innovators to extend their focus beyond the laboratory by exploring commercialization strategies for their innovations. Training outstanding students and researchers with entrepreneurial skills will help recruit and retain the best and the brightest in Kentucky and establish an entrepreneurial culture of value to the entire state. This program will also reach out to attract a diverse student body and group of researchers from under-represented groups in the STEM fields. The program will expand and develop a new paradigm at the University of Louisville that capitalizes on institutional strengths and resources for evaluating the potential, developing and establishing successful entrepreneurial ventures in emerging technologies."

Fungal infection of plants is an ongoing major threat to human agriculture, thus stressing the importance of the research proposed in this project. The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

The unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

With an I-Corps Sites designation at the University of Maine, its Foster Center builds upon the programming and the university's research and development activities to support campus-based teams. The Site's innovation training supports the commercialization of natural resource-based technologies that can have a significant impact on rural communities. Maine relies on a natural resource-based economy and the state adopts unique tactics to remain innovative. 

The UMaine I-Corps Site program fills a critical gap between awareness and training and more intensive support programs. Involving teams in the I-Corps Site at an early stage in the commercialization pathway increases the likelihood of success as these teams move into more intensive accelerator and incubation programs and the next step in the commercialization pathway. The Site acts as a "pre-accelerator" helping them understand the market opportunities for their technologies through customer discovery and competitive and patentability analysis.

While supporting rural economic growth, the I-Corps Site also supports the full inclusion of women in entrepreneurship with a campus research center focused on recruiting, retaining, and advancing women faculty. Campus resources for women researchers are utilized and expanded with resources from I-Corps. The Foster Center incorporates training to help women entrepreneurs reach commercialization. The Foster Center has a strong history of promoting female entrepreneurship, and four out of five teams currently participating in the Center's Accelerator program are led by women. Notably, the I-Corps Site will be led by two successful and experienced female innovators.

"abstractText": "The fundamental goals of this proposal are increasing the diversity of students studying environmental science and training the next generation of global scientists. US students will work in collaborative teams with scientists from UMBC and the Bahamas to study the critically endangered Bahama Oriole. Six students per year will work with mentors doing international research in the Bahamas, followed by data analysis and presentation back at UMBC. These projects will enable students to develop deep understanding of a range of topics in environmental science related to island ecosystems, extinction and climate dynamics. Island ecosystems have always been vulnerable to human impacts, and many island species are endangered or have become extinct. The islands of the Caribbean represent a biodiversity hotspot that is acutely threatened by climate variations. The Caribbean is home to fifteen endangered songbird species, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). The proposed student research experience is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) to determine the status of the Bahama Oriole and to understand how habitat and climate change may affect it.

In the current global extinction crisis, islands are especially vulnerable, and most endangered and extinct avian species are (or were) island species. The Bahama Oriole is now restricted to Andros, having been extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s. The likely threats facing the Bahama Oriole are typical for island species, ranging from introduced predators to anthropogenic habitat change. The impacts of climate change on endemic species in the Caribbean may be especially intense drying and warming are altering fire regimes while rising sea levels and increased hurricane intensity are causing forest mortality. The proposed student research projects address the full scope of these issues facing this critically endangered songbird. Teams of Bahamian and US mentors will together advise undergraduate students on a series of independent research projects. One UMBC PhD student will be continually on-site in the Bahamas to help mentor the students. Student projects will teach the students skills that can be applied in a range of STEM careers. Project topics include 1) population ecology (e.g., estimating population size), 2) remote sensing (e.g., effects of climate change on pine habitat), and 3) predation (e.g., radio tracking to study annual survival). Recently, the research team conducted two pilot trips with diverse teams of students from UMBC and The Bahamas. These student-led efforts confirmed the feasibility of these projects and demonstrated how little is known about the Bahama Oriole.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in three aspects: through a systematic customer discovery process, it enhances the R&D community's understanding of the potentially broad needs and application spaces of the contact-less physiological monitoring. For the robust heart-rate tracking technologies that this I-Corps project is based on, the potential commercial impact includes monitoring drivers' conditions to enhance driving safety, supporting safe and effective athletic/fitness training, offering additional analytics from surveillance video for public safety, and more. The outcome of the I-Corps customer discovery will provide real-world requirements and data to a new round of R&D and enhance the R&D community's scientific and technological understanding.  The I-Corps training and experience will prepare the Team to identify and pave a way to the most effective customer-technology path for commercialization, which will lead to an economic and societal impact.  The training would also provide valuable insights to the Technical Lead and Co-Lead, who as faculty members can potentially incorporate the Lean Startup and entrepreneurial thinking into their future education and mentoring activities. This would extend the benefits to many students in the years to come.

This I-Corps project builds on the research advances of contact-free sensings, such as through video, to capture the very small color changes of a person's face as his/her heart pumps blood to reach the whole body.  The team has developed a strong expertise to harvest such micro signals under a number of scenarios and motivating applications. From the patent-pending research on which this I-Corps project is based, accurate heart rate detection and tracking have been achieved even under significant motion as users move and lighting conditions change, which is common in real-world use.  The synergy of multiple traditionally separate fields, including image/video processing, computer vision, statistical signal processing and estimation, paved a foundation to address the R&D challenges.  The methodologies learned from the I-Corps program serve as a bridge between the theory and practice of micro signal analytics in the important emerging area of health analytics.

The Node is also integrating I-Corps concepts into the core curriculum for over 3,000 students of all majors. The Node intends to pursue multiple research initiatives to further improve the program outcomes, and will continue to teach innovators about customer discovery, commercial readiness and the development of sustainable business models. 

This project will continue to contribute a wide range of I-Corps materials, training practices, and curricula built upon its prior activities. These program components will be tailored to suit students, faculty, and other regional innovators. The Node will continue to work closely with Howard University (an I-Corps Site) to bring more I-Corps teams from this leading Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The Node will also collaborate with engineering research groups to provide women entrepreneurs training through I-Corps. Finally, the Node will continue to serve a wide geographic area with a very diverse demographic of innovators and entrepreneurs, including urban and rural populations. The DC Node will improve the success rate of technology transfer and commercialization from world-leading research universities and federal labs by creating new venture or licensing opportunities for program participants."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable more effective commercialization of a sustainable lawn alternative in the form of wildflower sod. Grass lawns are ubiquitous in the continental US covering an estimated 40 million acres of land, an area more than three times that of any other crop, including corn, soy and wheat. While grass lawns are beloved by American landowners, they are expensive, requiring more water, pesticide and fertilizer inputs than any other crop. These inputs degrade waterways and create biological deserts. In response, there is a growing call for sustainable lawn alternatives with an emphasis on native wildflower meadows. Despite the demand for meadowscapes, grass only turf continues to dominate the US landscape, in part, because the United States (US) does not have dependable, effective tools for meadow establishment. Introduction of wildflower sod/turf products to the US market will contribute to desired societal outcomes; such as meeting objectives mandated by state and federal water quality policies and initiatives, increasing biodiversity and helping ensure the health of pollinating insect communities, which provide food security through the pollination of wild and cultivated crops. 

This I-Corps project will advance the teams knowledge of potential barriers to widespread adoption of wildflower meadows. While the ecological benefits of wildflower meadows are fairly well understood, few studies have investigated meadow implementation from the perspective of land managers, landscape professionals and communities. Understanding the market obstacles of replacing high input lawns with sustainable flowering meadows is the first step in finding viable solutions. The technology being pursued is a biodiverse meadow sod comprised of native grasses and wildflowers. Conceptually, it is similar to traditional sod in that the turf is moveable and easy to install. The US team has partnered with a UK company which developed the production system on which the new technology is based, and has been the leading supplier of wildflower turf in Great Britain since 2003. The new IP will include adapting the UK growing system to 1) work with US plant species and climates, and 2) development of native seed mixes that grow well in the production system and that will provide the desired aesthetics for an urban setting

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the introduction of a new microscopy modality, which enables non-contact mechanical mapping, and the development of the corresponding add-on module compatible to commercial confocal microscopy instruments. Confocal microscopy instruments are widely used in academia and industry but do not provide mechanical information of samples; mechanical testing instruments are also ubiquitous in both academia and industry but are contact-based. This project brings the non-contact mechanical testing capability to optical microscopy instruments. Beyond enabling traditional material characterizations with high spatio-temporal resolution, the instrument will be highly impactful in biomedical research. The past two decades have seen increasing recognition of the prominent role of the mechanical interplay between cells and their local microenvironment to regulate cell function. A widely utilized optical microscope for cell biomechanics would accelerate our understanding of mechano-chemical pathways and their role in the control of biological processes. Thus, this instrument is expected to be broadly used by biomedical researchers and material scientists in industry and academia to access cell, tissue and biomaterial mechanical properties without perturbing the sample and with high 3D resolution.  

This I-Corps project explores the commercialization of an add-on module for confocal microscopes that features novel Brillouin spectroscopy.  Brillouin spectroscopy has been widely used for material testing and environmental sensing since the 1970's using specialized spectrometers that required 10 min to hours for a single measurement. In recent years, a new type of spectrometer was developed to improve speed of acquisition by several orders of magnitude and allowed to obtain 3D elasticity maps of biomaterials, biological cells and tissues. Thanks to the integration in commercial confocal microscopes, several highly impactful areas (e.g. stem cell lineage differentiation, malignancy transformation) will benefit from this technology as it enables gathering biomechanical information in environments and settings such as 3D microenvironments that mimic the in vivo conditions.  In addition, the instrument will enable the study of cell biomechanics on microfluidic platforms in order to control microenvironment conditions. Being compatible with traditional optical microscopes, this technology can also be combined with force mapping modalities thus enabling to investigate how cells sense mechanical stimuli and transduce them into biochemical signals.

"abstractText": "This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will engage a diverse group of US students on addressing the challenges faced by the water, sanitation, and electricity utilities of the future. In cities and towns in low- and middle-income countries, water, sanitation, and electricity services are provided through a patchwork of options: water may be provided only a few times a week through pipes, while houses use groundwater in the interim; electricity may be delivered through unreliable grids combined with decentralized solar home systems. At the same time, utilities in high-income countries are confronting changes in their industries: water and electricity utilities need to generate revenue while also encouraging conservation; wastewater facilities are transitioning from treatment and disposal to recovery of energy and nutrients. This presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine the future of these utilities. The forefront of innovation is occurring in low-income but rapidly developing cities like Nairobi, Kenya, which are open to new ideas given their more limited previous investments in centralized infrastructure. 

The IRES project will engage seventeen students over the course of three years to spend 10-12 weeks working alongside collaborators in Nairobi, Kenya, including researchers from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore University. The research focuses on addressing the common challenges faced by water, electricity, and sanitation utilities in rapidly changing cities. Example projects include: designing a sensing system for electric vehicles to provide grid balancing in Kenya; comparing the environmental and human health impacts of neighborhood- and city-wide human waste management options; improving water supply operations and planning; and quantifying the flexibility of industrial electricity consumption in Kenya. Students will be recruited from multiple disciplines, with a focus on ensuring participation by students traditionally underrepresented in STEM. To prepare for the summer spent in Kenya, students will enroll in a one-credit course. Projects will be designed such that students have clear objectives and can accomplish data collection and analysis within the given timespan, and integrate their project into their overall student experience. Students will also have the opportunity for professional development, including engaging with industries and government in Kenya and participating in a one-week workshop on writing and data presentation. The result will be a cohort of US students equipped with the ideas, skills, and motivation to improve the service delivery of the water, sanitation, and electricity utilities of the future and function as members of global workforces.

"abstractText": "This project supports teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf)."

"abstractText": "This US-Spain IRES project further develops and expands research and training opportunities related to the anthropology of culture and heritage in Europe successfully launched in the 2010-2013 NSF-funded CHESS program (OISE-0968575). This project will provide an early-career international research experience for fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme of "Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)" as part of a three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) "Crisis, culture, and heritage" (2013-2014); 2) "Sustainable heritage, communities, and economies" (2014-2015); and 3) "Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms of value" (2015-2016).   Students will be trained through a course series in research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing for publication.  International research and training workshops at the two universities will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars, as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers.  

Intellectual merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for interdisciplinary research teambuilding. 

Broader impacts: Government institutions face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse, multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained in the anthropology of heritage and related fields.  Broader impacts of the project include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international, comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates, 2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally archived by the UMass Amherst library.  Holding an international CHESS workshop at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks, mentoring relationships, and collaborators."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the elimination or reduction of metrology and post processing analysis that is currently a standard requirement of polymer part manufacturing.  This process improvement that will be facilitated by sensor technology will reduce manufacturing time and cost by 20-40%, improve part quality consistency, and improve molding productivity by 100%. Each percentage point improvement in productivity corresponds to cost savings in excess of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and/or recycling of defective plastic parts.

This I-Corps project will enable the team to determine the ideal parameters of a multivariate shrinkage sensor for industrial polymer manufacturing.  The insights gained from at least one hundred customer interviews will drive decisions on the commercial potential of a new multi-mode shrinkage monitoring sensor that will obviate the need for manual inspections and enable fully automatic production by directly measuring molded products as they are made, before the mold opens, so that defectives parts can be automatically diagnoses and recycled.  Through I-Corps, the team will assess current sensor design, its relative value compared to existing sensors and inspection procedures in the polymer manufacturing industry, and facilitate identification of customer segments with a critical unmet need for in-mold shrinkage sensor capability. Further, key learning from the I-Corps process will drive refinement of sensor development with the goal of developing a more commercially relevant sensor and provide industrial connections for sensor testing in the future. This overall enhanced knowledge of the industry will additionally reduce commercialization risk should a start-up or licensing opportunity be pursued.

This I-Corps project is based on preliminary results that we obtained on a PC platform to identify and track human body joint points in close to real-time. The prototype leverages novel machine learning algorithms and high performance processors (graphics processing units). Our next phase of research is to generate depth map from a 2D camera, recognize and track body joint points, and score body movements, all on a tablet platform. The challenges include depth generation with 2D images and efficient models and algorithms to execute on a resource constraint embedded platform. The team will leverage embedded deep learning techniques to optimize the algorithms towards an embedded processor architecture on modern tablets so that the proof-of-concept can deliver satisfactory performance.

To curb this unprecedented loss of biological diversity, it is critical to understand how organisms respond to and persist in such rapidly-changing environments. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will explore how natural populations survive the challenges of their natural environment, and then leverage this understanding to determine how the same populations respond to novel human-mediated changes. This IRES project, therefore, will provide insights needed to slow the current, unprecedented loss of biodiversity.

This IRES project will train cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities), for a period of six weeks each year in field research and conservation science in the remote Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands serve as an ideal setting for this IRES project, as the archipelago is composed of dynamic ecosystems where organisms face constantly-changing conditions caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. An international team from the University of Miami and local non-government organizations will lead the program, offering diverse perspectives and unique expertise to create a thriving environment for student mentorship. The major goal is for students to first leverage natural systems by executing group experiments that explore how populations meet the challenges of their natural environment. Students will then expand on this understanding of natural systems by developing independent projects to test how the same populations respond to human-mediated disturbances. A follow-up course in the US will provide additional training and career development, with the goal of publishing the student projects. The result is an IRES program where a diverse, international team will equip the next generation of scientists with a more global perspective to tackle our planet's most pressing challenges.

This IRES project has two major broader impacts. First, this project will train undergraduate students in international research and conservation, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities). This IRES project will therefore tackle the lack of diversity in STEM, and provide international experience that is critical for preparing students to compete in a global market. Second, this IRES project will help establish conservation initiatives in a biodiversity hotspot. The conservation initiative includes students working with local stakeholders in collecting field data and conducting outreach to empower local communities in establishing sustainable practices. By collecting baseline data, students involved in this IRES project will help in the establishment of an ambitious conservation area. This IRES project, therefore, addresses a fundamental question in Biology, while providing students with experience in initiating impactful conservation programs.

I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.

This project will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline, previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international level."

The next generation of the telecommunication network (5G and beyond) is going to be a technological paradigm shift, which is not only an evolution of the network but also the underlying fabric of an entire ecosystem of fully connected intelligent sensors and devices. 5G is an enabler of many applications and will impact virtually every industry sector, ranging from automotive, manufacturing, healthcare to smart city Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes. Full realization of the economic growth of 5G, however, will depend on how robustly the network is deployed, and will require different approaches from those used in the past. In order to enable the ten-fold increase in data-rate and capacity, 5G network will heavily rely on advanced wireless technologies. The company's technology platform will solve some of the key challenges of wireless radios and networks, and will pave the way towards the rapid roll-out and growth of 5G, in the global race to get to the 5G first.

This I-Corps project aims to enable multi-gigabit wireless communications for the emerging high-speed wireless applications. The core of the company's technology is a high-performance RF front-end, which enables our unique combination of features in our innovative wireless transceiver. The proposed RF front-end is based on novel system-level architectures along with high-performance RF components and sub-systems that are fundamentally different from the existing state-of-the-art fiber-speed wireless modules. To enable realization of the RF front-end, the team is applying a set of innovative design methodologies and technologies to tackle the challenges of the proposed complex RF front-end architectures. The company's RF front-end platform is the core technical contribution and intellectual merit of the approach, which provides the hardware necessary to enable the vision of a truly fiber-speed network with the ultimate network robustness, agility, with significant cost savings for the operators and businesses.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to identify stakeholders and customers and to develop the most appropriate path forward to translate the company's technology to the clinic and bring it to the patients. Currently young girls suffering from premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) as a result of anticancer treatments have limited and inadequate options to undergo puberty and start their transition into adult life. The existing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) applied to induce puberty in girls with POI leads to long-term morbidities, such as decreased bone density, predisposition to obesity and diabetes. The company's technology allows the restoration of ovarian endocrine function in prepubescent girls and has the potential to become a central mainstream treatment for POI, which would result in significant improvement of the short and long-term health and eliminate long-term morbidities associated with premature ovarian failure. The commercial benefit of the proposed treatment would result from significant lower health costs associated with obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis.  

This I-Corps project will further the company's understanding of the current state of the field and the value of the proposed technology, and help identify the next steps for preclinical and clinical studies. The company developed an immunoisolating capsule that supports the survival and function of ovarian allograft eliminating the need for immune suppression. The company's central hypothesis is that ovarian tissue secretes the gonadal hormones, estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, activins and inhibins, in response to systemic hormone stimulation in a pulsatile and dynamic rate required for physiological progression through puberty, growth and associated metabolic changes. Experimental data from in vivo mouse and primate studies have demonstrated promising results of restoration of hormone function integrated in the endocrine system and neuroendocrine axis, with no evidence of immune rejection or local inflammatory adverse response. The next critical steps in the company's project is to perform customer discovery and identify partners for first-in-human trials.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital content. Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations, diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An affordable full-page tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics would significantly improve blind people's access to digital technology. New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind people. 

The I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display. Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs. These are all essential features for building dense-array tactile displays, particularly ones that are low-cost and suitable for rendering braille and tactile graphics.

The proposed work is envisioned to improve the quality-of-life of people with disabilities and their caregivers, transform the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis care to data-based diagnosis and model-based design and 3D-printing, and provide an international research experience to students. The goal of this collaboration is to provide a high-quality international research experience to University of Michigan students to increase student diversity and retention and advance students' ability in and knowledge of culture, globalization, leadership, teamwork, and communication. The key intellectual merit of this collaboration is in the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices. The project will utilize technical knowledge gained from University of Michigan and will improve individualized assistive devices such as the knee-ankle-foot orthosis, a brace that helps people with leg instabilities to walk. 

The scientific objective of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy on the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices (IADs). The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient. For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally, the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically, this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the patient-specific KAFO.

The broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury. The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

"abstractText": "This project, from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, extends this institution's NSF I-Corps Site for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and entrepreneurship.

Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. 

Since June 2014, the University of Minnesota (UMN) Innovation Corps (MIN-Corps) program provided infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training, and NSF-supported project funding to UMN students, faculty, and staff pursuing commercialization. As of December 31, 2017, MIN-Corps had hosted over 1,000 participants - more than half of whom were women - in its courses, seminars, or outreach events. Over 180 innovation teams trained with MIN-Corps, leading to seven participants in the national I-Corps Teams program, 12 licenses of UMN intellectual property, and a dozen startups and other continuing projects that have received over $8 million in commercialization grants and/or investor funding. 

The primary goals for the next funding cycle are to increase the quantity and quality of technology commercialization across UMN, increase program participation and commercialization activity by women and under-represented minorities, extend programming to UMN campuses in under-resourced communities outside the Twin Cities, and contribute to the vitality of the Midwest and national technology entrepreneurship and commercialization ecosystem.

Changes such as droughts, floods, deforestation, urbanization, and grain supply (acreage and yields) fluctuations have considerable impact on businesses as well as the environment. For example, it is estimated that US lost approximately 23 billion dollars due to drought in 2012. This I-Corps project will make use of vast amounts of satellite data to provide accurate, timely and actionable insights about these changes to customers in various industries such as commodity trading, crop insurance, and precision agriculture, pasture management. Our ability to track these changes at a global scale will also improve our understanding of the impact of climate and human induced changes on various ecosystems. 

This I-Corps project uses machine learning algorithms that analyze vast amounts of satellite imagery datasets to provide near real time as well as historical information about various changes on the Earth's surface. These algorithms were developed through various federal research grants which includes three NSF grants. Data products created using these algorithms have been validated to improve the state-of-the-art in several earth science applications such as forest fire mapping, surface water dynamics, palm oil plantation mapping, and crop mapping. The analytics technology is more generally applicable to other domains with similar underlying data characteristics. The commercial-use prototype will be developed with commodity traders providing expert feedback on their most meaningful use-cases.

Commercially, the project falls within the rehabilitation robot market, specifically the segment that addresses neurological rehabilitation. Currently, available robotic rehabilitation technology focuses mainly on the recovery of motor function after stroke and restricts patient motion to a single plane. This project involves a robotic device that extends the scope of current rehabilitation robots by a) allowing unrestricted 3D movement, and b) incorporating somatosensory in addition to motor training methods. The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is not restricted to clinics specializing on stroke rehabilitation. The device can be used on a broad disease spectrum that includes stroke, but can be extended to patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and traumatic brain injuries.

This I-Corps project further develops a robotic rehabilitation device that seeks to improve wrist/hand function. The robot comprises a series of motors that can passively move the human wrist/hand, or assist/resist active human wrist motion. It allows for unrestricted 3-dimensional motion while precisely recording wrist joint motion. The system is integrated with a visual virtual reality environment that can provide movement feedback and can serve as an interface for visual-based training regimes. The technology has been tested in over 300 human users aged 18-82 years. It has been applied to assess sensory and motor dysfunction in stroke survivors and patients with Parkinson's disease. Test-retest reliability and validity of its outcome measures has been established."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from the potential of our technology to enable untapped energy efficiency, cost, size, and security benefits in the IoT space. In the low-power embedded systems that drive IoT applications, energy efficiency is the primary factor that determines critical system characteristics such as size, weight, cost, reliability, and lifetime. Likewise, security is critical for IoT systems, which are entrusted with nearly all our data ? personal, financial, health-critical, and otherwise. Because of their extreme energy constraints and ubiquitous scale of deployment, these systems have traditionally favored low cost and low power over security, exposing a huge attack surface for information security attacks. Several large-scale exploits have already been reported. By providing automated and low-overhead solutions for security and energy efficiency, our technology has the potential to make a disruptive impact on the IoT space, which is predicted to have a market size of $457 billion by 2020. Additionally, the solutions we provide have the potential to improve information security for the population at large and allow broader deployment of IoT systems that promise to improve quality of life and understanding of the world.

This I-Corps project is built around technologies that enable aggressive optimization of microprocessors for energy savings, cost reduction, and security. The technologies are based on novel, automated system analysis approaches that identify unused parts of a design and leverage the information to improve system efficiency. The technologies have demonstrated reductions of over an order of magnitude in energy efficiency and area for ultra-low-power microprocessors through a host of application-aware optimization and design techniques. The technologies also allow software programmers to evaluate information flow security for their software on the processor(s) where it will be deployed, enabling software to be certified with security guarantees. Results from our research and initial customer discovery indicate potential to impact the semiconductor industry. Through our technology, design and operating costs for application-specific processors can be significantly reduced, accelerating production of such processors, allowing them to be more widely deployed, and providing traction for new markets such as DIY printed processors. Also, reducing energy for low-power processors that drive the internet of things (IoT) can significantly impact lifetime, reliability, size, and cost of these devices that continue to grow in dominance of the semiconductor market as the IoT revolution continues.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can be significant as it can provide pathways for commercialization of a breakthrough research for continuous miniaturization of computer chips. For the digital electronics in everyday use, smaller and better chips imply lesser cost, higher performance, and more features. As traditional way of IC scaling reaches unsurmountable barriers at sub-10nm technology nodes, the proposed technology provides new directions for scaling through innovations in several layers from fundamental physical components, computing model, to circuits and integration. In addition, the technology promises denser, faster and more power efficient computing with unique capabilities for fault-tolerant and secure hardware through inherent physical capabilities and design choices. The technology, coupled with Intellectual Property (IP) development strategy based fabless commercialization approach is proposed for market penetration and growth at a fast turn-around time.  The product will be beneficial for a wide range of customers from microprocessor producers to consumer electronics manufacturers and be particularly attractive for defense entities. This I-corps teams project will allow customer discovery, business model generation and evaluation of commercialization potentials for successful SBIR/STTR proposals, and can ultimately lead to the transition of lab research to product. It will have a lasting impact on the participants. 
 
This I-Corps project seeks commercialization potential of a novel computing technology that relies on deterministic interference between adjacent nanoscale interconnects (Crosstalk) for logic computing. The proposed approach departs from current device switching dependent computing paradigm and relaxes difficult device scaling requirements. The scalability in Crosstalk fabric is determined primarily by circuit scheme, integration and the ability to pattern smaller metal nano-lines and deposit dielectrics in between them, which can be done by utilizing existing EDA and manufacturing methods. The proposed computing approach is functionally complete, and provides huge opportunities for logic reduction; by having more than 2 inputs couple to a single output and by varying their respective coupling capacitances, a logic implementation (e.g., Carry logic for Addition) that would typically require more than 15 transistors in CMOS, can be done by just 5 transistors. The benchmarking of a 4-bit adder showed over 5x density benefits vs. CMOS at 16nm. Another distinct feature of Crosstalk technology is the run-time reconfigurability that allows different functionalities to be embedded in the same circuit, which can be transformative for fault tolerance (i.e., if a portion of CPU is damaged, the functioning portion can be configured to do both tasks), and cybersecurity.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is pivoted around the emerging whole slide imaging market segment in digital pathology. The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service. The technology has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in WSI storage and management using a big data approach.

Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies. We will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors both nationally and regionally near our home institutions, as this will facilitate the participation of under-represented minority, first-time college, and veteran students who often remain close to their hometown when pursuing higher education. Our collaboration with Mexican colleagues and mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.

The Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project will provide ten undergraduate student a year with the opportunity to investigate basins located along the central Gulf of California rift in Baja California Sur Mexico, an area that has not been thoroughly mapped within the framework of tectonics and thus provides an excellent field location to study the progressive evolution of a rifted continental margin and its unique continued magmatic activity and economic mineralization. The young geologic age of the sedimentary basins, excellent exposures, and field access, as well as sedimentary fill with numerous tuffs and uplifted terraces dateable by radiometric and OSL methods, make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. This Baja Basins IRES program will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate internationally with mentors from our partner universities in Mexico (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur and Universidad de Guanajuato) and several mining companies. Students will develop field and laboratory skills in basin analysis and tectonics in a volcanic-sedimentary sequence that is geologically interesting, economically important, and culturally diverse.

Additionally, the US ranks only 11th world-wide in terms of infrastructure competitiveness. America's infrastructure, particularly its 50-100+ year-old bridges, is in poor health, representing a hidden crisis. Rural areas, due to their lower population density and distance from urban centers, are acutely affected by this crisis, particularly in terms of public safety and economic growth. Limited budgets for planning and maintenance only serve to exacerbate the crisis. To better inform future research, the research team held collaborative conferences and workshops, and conducted stakeholder surveys to identify issues impacting rural bridge health. Outcomes from these activities underscored the value of big data technologies to address the crisis and informed the proposed work. The mission of this multi-institution and multi-sector project is to produce a big data pipeline for rural bridge health management that improves transportation network performance and enhances safety.

The research team will combine existing and new datasets to address challenges of relevance to bridge owners using scalable and replicable big data pipeline components. Activities will inform bridge owner decision-making by integrating existing datasets and data collected using next-generation health monitoring technologies (e.g., contact and non-contact sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles) with innovative data management techniques. Socio-technical impacts associated with potential decisions will also be assessed. Aging, rural bridge testbeds will be selected in consultation with public and private owners to produce data products that facilitate decision-making and ultimately, provide economical and reliable solutions that improve bridge health. Results from the research will be shared with engineers, owners, and builders at workshops hosted by the research team. Project findings will be disseminated through publications, conferences, meetings, and forums. The research team will engage with the Big Data Hubs and Spokes network to make data, methods, and results available across regions. By extension, project findings will also benefit activities used to monitor and manage other important infrastructure assets, including highways, buildings, power grids, offshore oil platforms, water networks, and other civil infrastructures.

Abstract Date:	03/24/16

Rehabilitation of historical/existing structures is an area ripe for research.  With an increasing number of aging structures in the United States, there is a growing need for workforce development to address the potential for historic preservation in coming years.  The goal of this project is to develop a cadre of experts with specialized training and global awareness in the engineering aspects of historical preservation projects.  To address this need, Dr. Erdogmus from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will collaborate with the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) of Turkey.  This 3-year program will bring a group of nine US students to Turkey for a seven-week summer research in historic preservation engineering.  It is the intention of the PI to recruit at least 50% of the cohort each year from underrepresented groups.  The Turkish mentors from IZTECH are Dr. Mine Turan and Dr. Engin Aktas, representing the Architectural Restoration and Civil Engineering Departments, respectively.  Under the experienced leadership of the hosts and the PI, the US students participating in the program will be provided with meaningful and comprehensive research experiences comprised of lab-work at IZTECH campus and a variety of field-applications that involve historical sites. 

This three year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will involve American graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the interface of structural engineering and conservation with three focus themes: 1) Engineering- conservation coordination for assessment of historical structures and materials prior to an intervention, 2) Engineering- conservation coordination for the development of compatible materials for historical retrofits, and 3) Post-Intervention assessment and risk analysis for the collapse-safety of structures. Under each of these focus themes, the IRES students will conduct specific projects and tasks; namely, the students will: a) Develop a novel method to provide a closed feedback loop on complex sites, which involves a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) based rating system for each element correlating the visual assessments to its interior damage levels.  This will then inform variant constitutive models and aid in the design for the conservation intervention. b) Investigate chemical and mechanical properties of modern cements from different locations in order to evaluate their behavior under extreme heat, salt water, and freeze-thaw cycles when paired with different historical stones. c) Develop a decision making algorithm for historical structures using probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses to identify safety concerns and to predict design event recurrence intervals for which a given structure remains safe. This algorithm will then support decisions for or against intervention, ensuring only a minimum level of invasive intervention applied to the historic site. This work is funded by the IRES program of NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE)."

"abstractText": "This U.S.-Czech international research experience for students (IRES) project supports a partnership between scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the Czech Technical University-Prague (CTU) that is designed to prepare U.S. students for STEM graduate-level study through an early career cooperative research experience focused on the earth's vadose zone, known as the geologic "skin of the earth." For each of the three years of this IRES project, cohorts of four U.S. science and engineering students will expand their global competence through a well-integrated, eight-week international research and educational experience in the Czech Republic. Principal Investigator Chittaranjan Ray (UNL), along with lead counterparts Michal Snìhota and Martin Sanda (CTU), will serve as mentors.  In their collaboration with CTU scientists and students, U.S. participants will jointly conduct hypothesis-driven laboratory experiments and field investigations designed to characterize water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils with macro pores (large pores due to wormholes, cracks etc.) at site-to-watershed scale in the Czech Republic.  The U.S. students will learn about creative, original, and potentially transformative methods the Czechs are using to study the fate and transport of water and contaminants through the unsaturated zone, particularly in terms of preferential flow.  New research results and knowledge of novel technologies being used in Europe will be shared in the U.S. through this project, thereby contributing to the development of a more globally engaged science workforce as well as to the sustainability of valuable water resources which affect economic competitiveness both domestically and internationally.

U.S. IRES participants will collaborate with the Czech researchers to evaluate the utility and accuracy of these new methods, which promise to significantly expand scientific understanding of vadose zone processes. These are considered critical to protecting and preserving ground water resources. As the "skin" of the earth, the vadose zone, or the unsaturated zone, regulates various functions like water percolation and contaminant attenuation, among others. Over the course of their IRES research abroad, U.S. students will learn about and use new technologies and methods developed in Europe.  Understanding flow and transport processes in the vadose zone is a key to identifying ground water pollution potential and to developing mitigation strategies.  IRES participants also will work with Czech partners to evaluate the utility and accuracy of innovative Czech technologies used to study water flow at different scales. Their findings are expected to materially contribute data about the correlation of small-scale measurements of soil properties to watershed processes.  Overall, the IRES experience is intended to encourage a diverse group of undergraduate participants to pursue graduate education in STEM fields.  The U.S. students will be encouraged to publish and to share their experiences via the UNL-maintained IRES website and through presentations at appropriate professional meetings, such as meetings of the American Society of Engineering Education."

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

UNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries. The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.

UNH's existing commercialization infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative process include:
   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; 
   (2) A 10-week LLP course with exposure to the entire business model canvas; 
   (3) A demo day to showcase ideas; and 
   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary conversations. 
Promising projects are connected to business mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry of ideas.

Implementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic and social potential. 

To assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site to the national innovation network.

The UNH Site impacts transcend exposure to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE, UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented cohorts in commercialization."

We have entered the era of ubiquitous computing, an era defined by interconnected devices embedded in everyday objects that become part of everyday activities. Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary field of study that explores the design and implementation of embedded, networked computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With these modes of interaction, the user's focus can remain primarily on the world surrounding the device. Human-computer interaction is a central issue in ubicomp, and it will be the focus of the work of the IRES students who will conduct research at two locations in Germany: at the University of Stuttgart, and at the University of Oldenburg. 

Technical Abstract:
Our research will explore human-computer interaction in three areas of ubicomp: in-vehicle interactions, interactions with large displays, and interactions with devices on a ship bridge. We will explore user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will have less to do with the driver?s attention to the road (as is the case in today?s vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed, quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles. In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces that keep the human operator?s attention on the relevant interfaces and on the outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator?s visual focus, and how to guide the operator?s shift of attention towards these entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction, task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved designs of interactions with large displays."

The Lobo Rainforest I-Corps Site is a partnership between UNM's two innovation and entrepreneurial units, the Innovation Academy (iA) and STC.UNM (STC). The iA provides students with direct experience and real-world skills in entrepreneurship, equipping them with the requisite proficiency to transition their original ideas into the marketplace. iA offers a suite of courses, a scholars project-based program, a minor in innovation, and an entrepreneurial literacy program. STC works with entrepreneurial faculty and students at UNM to explore new inventions, commercialize technologies, protect intellectual property and create start-up companies based on UNM research innovations. iA, STC and their programs and services co-locate at the Lobo Rainforest Building, a new structure with spaces to accelerate commercialization of intellectual capital and generate successful startup companies. NSF I-Corps Site funding leverages these innovation and technology transfer services, physical facilities, expert staff, and business, industry, and community connections and networks to support 117 new student and faculty teams over a five-year period. Teams collaborate with two I-Corps Nodes in the Southwest corridor, further building on local and regional ecosystems for innovation, and connecting with the National Innovation Network.

New Mexico is a majority-minority state, and UNM is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a strong track record of supporting commercialization of faculty-originated technology, including 139 women inventors. The iA is comprised of over 50% women, over 50% minorities, and over 65% first generation college students. UNM's demographic is unique for a Carnegie R1 doctoral university (61% minority, 41% Hispanic, 56% female), making it an excellent environment for recruiting and broadening participation of women and minorities in entrepreneurial activities. UNM is also implementing an NSF ADVANCE grant, focused on increasing the participation of women faculty, particularly minority women, in STEM leadership positions, complementing the Lobo Rainforest I-Corps Site program. The UNM I-Corps Site will focus on those mechanisms most useful in expanding entrepreneurial opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups."

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The Greensboro I-Corps Training Site (GRIT) is a collaboration between the geographically adjacent University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG-lead institution) and North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University (N.C. A&T). Expanding on the existing entrepreneurship missions at the two universities, the GRIT facilitates the commercialization of innovative ideas and research at both institutions, as well as nearby institutions of higher education and the surrounding communities. UNCG's North Carolina Entrepreneurship Center (NCEC) recruits teams from both schools, provides training and measures outcomes of the program. The program focuses on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and also looks to provide training to any innovation that offers scalable solutions to societal problems.

This Site focuses on inclusion of diverse perspectives from underrepresented cohorts by expanding the training of the commercialization process to populations often underrepresented in entrepreneurship. Expanding training opportunities to women, minorities, people with disabilities, military veterans, and new immigrants fosters greater inclusion. UNCG, a former women's college and a Minority Serving Institution (MSI), and N.C. A&T, the nation's largest Historically Black College and University (HBCU), provide a large ideal population of diverse potential entrepreneurs. 

The Greensboro area is transforming its economic identity by embracing entrepreneurial activities and inclusiveness of underrepresented populations through establishment and support of community accelerators and programs that will help advance this new growth. The GRIT helps support local economic development collaborations between universities, industry, and local government by providing a new source of trained entrepreneurs and technologies, ultimately directly benefiting the community."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to facilitate the development of a versatile point-of-care (POC) biosensor for decentralized laboratory testing, and to investigate the market potential for early detection of protein biomarkers for diseases. The focus areas are in cardiovascular disease, breast milk banks, and assisted living facilities. There is a need for early diagnosis of heart failure, especially myocardial infarction, by monitoring cardiac biomarkers. This is not only for the patient's survival, but also reducing treatment costs. This biosensor technology will potentially be the first product on the market for a portable, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project may accelerate POC diagnostics research and personalized medicine, including early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Thus, it will permit a more effective deployment of therapies. The developed product is expected to find broader commercial applications including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical researchers, life science studies, hospital and healthcare facilities, diagnostics and patient monitoring, home and remote use, as well as drug discovery in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.

This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for the innovative biosensor. The end product will be a lab-on-a-chip based POC technology for use in complex biological media, like whole blood, which commonly requires sample pretreatment and/or separation of the large blood cells. The POC device will provide exclusive delivery of protein biomarkers (e.g. troponin) to the detection area for highly sensitive and reliable detection from a drop of whole blood. The uniqueness of the innovation lies in the nanoscale structures that are fabricated into thin metal films and integrated with microfluidics for direct optical measurement. The combination of on-chip/in-line sample preparation and fluid handling integrated with a simple, label-free, optical detection system enables a complete lab-on-chip system. This system may offer several advantages over conventional biomarker detection methods for use in complex samples. These include high throughput, high sensitivity, elimination of interferences from large blood cells, lower cost, ease of operation and simplified sample pretreatment. The I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative applications of parallel, multiple biomarker analysis and determine the readiness to transition the biosensor to a viable product.

"abstractText": "The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

With this project, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte creates an I-Corps Site.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The UNC Charlotte I-Corp Site, the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program, enables a substantial expansion of faculty and student customer discovery and startup participation by building upon programs and resources that are underway at the University. UNC Charlotte, through its Charlotte Research Institute and Ventureprise organizations, offers an integrated series of programs that directly address early idea identification, customer discovery, startup and growth stage guidance. 

The I-Corps Site funding at UNC improves visibility of entrepreneurship, incent broad student and faculty participation, and drives commercialization opportunities that leverage the University's major investment in innovation and entrepreneurship personnel and infrastructure.  The Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program is likely to yield insights into best practices applicable to a public university with a diverse student population that includes many first generation college students. The program operates in a region with strong corporate operations and modest venture capital presence and is designed to engage corporate partners in team evaluation and guidance. 

Broader Impacts:
UNC Charlotte serves more than 26,000 students with a substantial population of underrepresented minorities (23% African-American and Hispanic) and numerous students from modest economic circumstances. The UNC I-Corps Site focuses on this population and on reducing the barriers to STEM entrepreneurial participation by all motivated and qualified UNC Charlotte students.

The rapidly growing Charlotte region with 2.6 million residents and strong corporate presence participate in the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program through mentor engagement and community entrepreneur involvement. This creates linkages between the diverse student population and community resources, strengthening student network access. The I-Corps evidence-based customer discovery methodologies have broader economic impact as they infuse the region's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The I-Corps Site funding increases engagement of University faculty and students with corporate innovation executives located in the Carolinas. This program strengthens and expands partnerships among the University, industry, and the entrepreneurial community. These partnerships directly affect commercialization and are likely to lead to additional collaborative research and other positive outcomes."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to build a recommender system which assigns values to artifacts and will also provide stakeholders in unregulated markets with better information for reducing risk and improving trust. The Internet and technology have entirely changed the nature of interactions between every business sector, including the art industry, by creating a digital marketplace and introducing additional issues for markets regulation. The proposed recommender system can be used to predict value of investment, to provide an objective value of goods in legal proceedings, insurance cases, and banks as a collateral toll.  This supports financial stability of markets through better decision making and improves the trust of stakeholders in their investments. It also helps to maintain control of the commercial aspects of work. For example, the acquisitions departments of museums would be served by knowing a real value for the artifacts they buy.

This I-Corps project is focused on building a recommender system for assigning values to artworks using existing datasets and deep knowledge. Art markets are often misvalued which makes the classical approach to building recommender systems rather difficult due to unreliable datasets. Classifiers trained on these datasets often assign inflated prices. A crowd approach is used here which is expected to give more reliable results. Personalization for this class of problems can be achieved by assigning semantic distance.  The project extends the group of classical features by adding semantic features from mining comments given by users, and, for example, from artist biographies, and images of paintings. For each cluster of semantically similar artists, a personalized recommender system for art evaluation is built. Wisdom of the crowd will be used to assign a specific value to an art piece."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications, and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI, asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field."

The educational kit bridges the gap between theoretical and practical molecular materials technologies. The kit is an interactive learning tool designed for interdisciplinary laboratory activities and can be used in physics, chemistry, engineering, and material science educational settings. The kits provide all needed materials, a fully developed curriculum, and training for implementation. Professional development workshops for instructors help to integrate the laboratory activities into instructor?s existing science curriculum while addressing national and international science standards. There is a significant market for hands-on laboratory activities that incorporate contemporary science experiments currently under investigation and development at the university level. School districts and science / engineering departments will likely be interested in acquiring the kits, making them a commercially impactful and important education platform. The kit is flexible and can be expanded upon to include future experiments and professional development. The kits can also be used and developed for extracurricular activities such as science fairs and competitions.

This I-Corps project involves a polymer electronics laboratory kit to improve materials science education for 9-12 and undergraduate students. The three-module kit and curriculum use polymer semiconductors to provide hands-on inquiry activities integrating themes of electrical conductivity, light emission, and light-harvesting solar energy conversion. These themes are critical to contemporary materials science research and education. The kit includes materials to evaluate the electrical properties of conductive colloidal polyaniline inks, to construct a polymer light- emitting diode using polyphenylene vinylene, and to build a polymer solar cell using semiconductive polymers and nanoparticulate TiO2. Designed initially for high school science classrooms, the activities developed also meet new collegiate undergraduate education requirements for macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanoscale systems in the curriculum and can be used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The modules and kit have also been implemented in professional development workshops for training 9&#8722;12 science educators to help integrate the laboratory activities into their curriculum.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental and green chemistry are becoming high priority and even pivotal issues with depletion of natural resources (e.g., petroleum) and increase of society's environmental footprint on a global scale. The IRES Interdisciplinary Environmental and Green Applications in Chemistry (IEGAC) program is the cooperative effort between research universities at North Dakota and Czech research Institutions addressing such environmental and green chemistry applications. The program encompasses novel environmental analytical methods, biotechnology processes as well as development of green organocatalysts. Each year, four undergraduate students and one graduate student will participate in an 8-week summer research experience at several premiere research institutions in Prague, Czech Republic, including the Department of Analytical Chemistry, Charles University (CUNI), the Department of Biotechnology, University of Chemical Technology (UCT), and Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB) of the Czech Academy of Sciences. 
The essential component of the program is exposure of participating students from the rural US Midwest to a global, multicultural, and interdisciplinary environment. This will further be promoted by  interactive pre- and post-travel coursework, which will be designed  to create effective research teams that work together throughout the experience. The students will be trained to effectively communicate their research results on several levels, including poster presentations at regional and national conferences and peer reviewed papers. The dissemination of the results at various levels is an essential element with commitment from all researchers involved. The research and cultural impact of the IEGAC program will also be communicated professionally by both students and mentors alike through online social media to the community. Overall, this program will provide outstanding professional development for its participating students and propel many toward graduate studies and careers in environmental and green chemistry that are in critical need.

"abstractText": "The Digital Agriculture Spoke of the Midwest Big Data Hub seeks to organize academic, industrial, and governmental sectors around the development of policies and best practices for data science and Big Data applications in agriculture, with a particular focus on automating the Big Data lifecycle for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and for plant sciences, phenomics, and genomics. This effort is necessitated by the projected growth in the global population (9.5 billion people by 2050), which will require the global agricultural workforce to produce 70% more food than our farmers do today. Historically, agricultural revolutions in cultivation, social organization, and industrialization have provided the means to increase food production. However, future revolutions must leverage the advantages provided by the modern information society. This project will serve as a catalyst for this data-driven revolution, which will be broad and societal in nature and address the triple-bottom line of being economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sensible. Whereas the initial focus areas are specific, the resulting best practices and partnership-building will translate to and enable other areas such as remote sensing systems and farm management techniques.  An expected outcome is improved and efficient use of UAS, imaging, and genomics in agricultural sciences, ultimately leading to a more sustainable global food and nutrition system. Coordination of these activities will be enhanced through a Digital Agriculture open web portal of data science resources, designed to integrate existing information silos, facilitate collaboration, and contribute to workforce development. Educational activities and tools will be leveraged from pre-existing traineeship programs and collaborative entities, and broadened with newly developed annual workshops. Special issue-teams of academic, industrial, and governmental representatives will be used to conduct deep-learning analysis of project educational activities to identify and refine mechanisms for broadening and diversifying participation. Through these efforts, the collaboration will improve access to data assets, train a workforce with relevant skills and expertise, and will contribute to solving the Sustainable Global Food and Nutrition Security challenge.

This project will focus on two knowledge domains important to agriculture, UAS, and Plant Sciences. These two themes of Intellectual Merit will be melded with cross-cutting activities designed to improve the management, accessibility, automation, and value of the lifecycle for data that are generated by multiple, high-throughput sensor and measurement platforms in contexts related to agriculture and agriculture production. Best practices for transport, storage, dissemination, and analysis of Big Data will be translatable and scalable to other areas such as farm management systems and precision agriculture, and will enable the access to and use of valuable data assets related to UAS and plant sciences, thereby accelerating progress toward sustainable agricultural production. Many of the ideas and methods developed under this project and the partnership-building activities that link multiple public institutions and private entities will be transferable to other disciplines that require Big Data, such as transportation, health sciences, and food, energy, and water, and will therefore generate innovation and discovery from many and complex data resources. One aspect of these partnerships is the desire to build a workforce with strong data science skillsets. To accomplish this, project activities include participation by undergraduate, graduate, and early career scientists in annual meetings, Zoom events, and webinars. Interested participants from the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors will be supported and encouraged to engage in cutting-edge research and development areas such as direct data collection of plant features by UAS, biological feature extraction through image analysis, Big Data processing pipelines, and techniques for data management and sharing. Diversity of innovation related to UAS and Plant Sciences will be encouraged through a suite of issue teams who analyze in-person and web-based trainings, goal-oriented Meetups, and conference events for diversity using deep learning techniques. These modalities for deep learning were selected for their scalability and improved access by underrepresented groups. The project has a heavy emphasis on workforce training and best practices. Workshops and webinars, including hackathons and datathons, will help both students and people already in the workforce expand their professional development."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.

This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming."

"abstractText": "This project will evaluate sediments deposited 300-million years ago in France at a time of abundant ice on the planet. This project will engage several teams of undergraduates from underserved populations - particularly indigenous peoples of the Plains and Southwest states - in scientific research within a culturally sensitive context. A total of 13 students will travel to France over three years to conduct field and lab work on red sediments analogous to the types of sediments and landscapes familiar to them in the U.S. They will work with both U.S. and French scientists in collecting data in both the field and the laboratory, while also learning about the history and culture of a part of France with a geologic history analogous to that of their homeland. This project will further our understanding of how Earth's surface conditions can behave under conditions analogous to the present. 

This IRES project will involve three student groups per year undertaking fieldwork in France. Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate. These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis. The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants. Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea. Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea. The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals. In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate interest in science and forge new international collaborations."

This project will also provide participants an opportunity for a hands on research experience using a one of a kind, outdoor, large scale 5G test-bed for wireless cellular system innovation that has recently been established at the University of Surrey as part of 5GIC.  Ultra-dense deployment of cellular systems is inevitable in near future to meet mounting capacity demands. Interference, energy and mobility are emerging as key constrains in realization of ultra-dense networks. This project focuses on building complementary international cooperative efforts to address these challenges. 

This project will enable US students and PIs to establish long-term collaborative links with globally recognized academia and international industrial partners in cellular domain. The project will introduce students to the European perspective on research and development in cellular domain. The extensive field research experiences planned in this project for undergraduates will help to increase the success of these students in graduate programs in engineering fields. For the graduate students participants, the opportunity to do validation of their ideas on a real network (5G test-bed) will help to transform and enhance their understanding of their research and promote the ability of US engineers to advance and contribute to leadership on state of the art mobile broadband wireless networks."

"abstractText": "Intellectual Merit:
This is a proposal from the University of Pennsylvania to establish an Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site at its commercialization hub, the Penn Center for Innovation (PCI). The Penn I-Corps Site will support translation of research from STEM areas into the marketplace by providing educational programming, financial support and strategic guidance through offering Site E-teams access to commercialization programs at PCI and a new entrepreneurial curriculum, as well as guidance by the Wharton Small Business Development Center.  

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

A typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.

I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The Penn Site will employ a structured process for business model validation following the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to expand PCI?s start-up creation services to teams involving faculty and students, provide hands-on experiential entrepreneurial education, and accelerate startup-creation at Penn. This project will provide a commercialization path for Penn?s educational entrepreneurial activities in STEM by expanding PCI?s company formation for faculty/student teams in STEM and by adding an entrepreneurial component to PCI?s educational programs.  

Broader Impacts:
A direct result of the PCI-ICS will be hands-on training in the Customer Discover Methodology (Blank, 2012) of 90+ faculty and students, creation of business plans and pitches suitable to present to partners and investors, the creation of new start-ups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating from Penn research.  The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization, while integrating education and traditional technology transfer activities by promoting a hands-on experiential approach to development of startup ideas. This will be accomplished by establishing a framework that acts as a bridge between educational coursework and PCI?s company formation programs.  

The PCI Site will help spawn faculty and students trained in fundamental aspects of entrepreneurism. A collaboration with the Wharton-SBDC will have the dual impact of providing business guidance to entrepreneurs in STEM and exposing business students to STEM areas of research. By connecting Penn nascent entrepreneurs with the PCI?s network of entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors as well as with the Ben Franklin Technology Partners Southeastern Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency and the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, the Penn I-Corps site may be an important contributor to the development of dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region."

"abstractText": "This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf)."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain?s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team will use machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial intent of our product is to provide potential customers with a tool to detect and prevent addiction overdose and relapse, offer interventions of supervised individuals, conserve emergency response resources, and save taxpayer money, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions -- some of which could be implemented by Internet of Things enabled devices (e.g. locking a car?s ignition; calling a sponsor; playing calm music; etc.), resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations.

This I-Corps project is focused on a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearable devices and artificial intelligence.  Detecting craving states is supported by past and current research, and there is scientific justification for gathering smartphone usage and biometric wearable data on drug users. Researchers have used the combination of smartphone usage and wearables data to predict binge drinking behavior and we plan to apply this research to opioid use. Additionally, cocaine and opioid research uses the same wearable device as our studies. We expand upon current research by combining just-in-time smartphone-based interventions for people in recovery for opioid use disorders with pattern-detection predictive models that will be trained at the population level and refined at the individual level. We will gather data on all relevant factors that determine drug relapse risk state: physiology, smartphone usage, location data, self-reports, and support-network-reports. Once a high-risk state is detected, a smartphone app-based intervention focused on behavior change will then be implemented in a timely and customizable manner.

"abstractText": "The objective of this project is to provide U.S. students with valuable research experience related to battery-less embedded systems in future Internet of Things (IoT) in China, which has one of the world's largest electronic industry and market. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit Tsinghua University (THU) over a period of eight (8) weeks. 

The vision of IoT is to embed small computers into objects around our daily life to improve our economy and societal well-being. It is estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020. However, one of the biggest challenges is how to power these billions of embedded devices since batteries need frequent recharging and impose health and environmental concerns. In this project, the students will work with renowned research groups at THU to develop future IoT sensors that can reply on energy harvested from ambient environment sources, such as solar energy, radio frequency energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Since ambient energy is intrinsically intermittent, the students will conduct research on nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software to realize computer systems that can work with intermittent energy supply. Such systems will dramatically improve our capability of collecting data while reducing the maintenance costs. Potential applications include smart healthcare, smart building and infrastructure monitoring, smart environmental monitoring, etc. This IRES project will not only offer U.S. students an opportunity to work in one of the best engineering research universities in China, but also fully immerse them in a foreign environment and improve their talents in working with a global team. 

The project contains well-planned recruitment, preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research targets at nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software issues in battery-less embedded systems that need to be addressed urgently. The first project aims to develop fast, energy efficient, and uniform write operations for nano-scale memory device, which is critical to tolerate intermittency of harvested energy. The project addresses a fundamental inconsistency issue when the NVP is interacting with external volatile peripheral devices, which is one of the most imminent roadblocks towards wide application of NVPs. 
The second project addresses a fundamental inconsistency issue when the battery-less device is collecting data and communicating with external devices. The project aims to develop efficient and accurate binarized neural network for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on nonvolatile IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications. 
 The third project aims to develop efficient and accurate artificial intelligence for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on battery-less IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications. It can be anticipated that with the close interaction with THU and the Beijing Innovation Center for Future Chips, the breakthroughs made from these projects can have a direct impact on future IoT market.

The project will enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on realizing battery-less embedded systems, in collaboration with their faculty mentors in THU. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the
research of embedded computer systems, on the culture of China, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through the personal social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, Web2.0 based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for local K-12 schools.

"abstractText": "Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools."

This project creates an NSF I-Corps Site at the University of Rochester.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

A typical I-Corps Site is funded for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization. The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum. With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

This I-Corps Site will take advantage of University of Rochester's strengths and past successes in fusing technology with entrepreneurship. This effort utilizes UR's research and commercialization base, a network of internal and external experts to train and mentor entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields. The recruitment and selection of 90 faculty and student teams is built on a proven process for selecting projects, identifying the necessary resources to advance the technology, and a curricular model based on the NSF I-Corps approach to aid in identification of viable business models and products.

The University of Rochester I-Corps Site takes advantage of the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) as a university hub leveraging UR Ventures, the university's technology transfer arm, and organizations such as High Tech Rochester (HTR), that provide technology entrepreneur business formation coaching, training and incubator space. The program includes five elements: workshops, mentoring, funding for projects, customer discovery, and community support to include incubator space.

Broader Impacts:
Since 2002, the University has assisted in the launch of over 50 startup companies. The I-Corps Site program will enable these researchers to continue along this trajectory by enabling them to investigate the real world applications of their scientific achievements. 
The I-Corps site program provides the University with the necessary tools to assess the innovations that have resulted from NSF funded research, begin the process of transferring these advancements from the bench-top to the bedside, and provide additional commercialization training to research faculty and students. Over 90 student teams will be supported and efforts will be made to select and recruit teams with women and minority participants."

"abstractText": "This IRES project provides experiences for 4-6 undergraduate researchers from the University of San Diego and Harvey Mudd College to spend 8-10 weeks researching brown carbon formation by aqueous photooxidation of atmospheric phenolic compounds. Four weeks of research will be conducted onsite at Universite Paris Est-Creteil (UPEC), where the cohort of undergraduate researchers will closely collaborate with their international mentors on a series of CESAM aerosol chamber experiments utilizing advance spectroscopic methods. After returning from France, the undergraduate research team will focus on the workup, interpretation, and presentation of chamber data, while continuing to interact with international mentors via video conferencing. Each participant will be involved in the project for at least one semester prior and two semesters subsequent to travel for training and further experimentation at their U.S. campuses. In total, 15 undergraduates over 3 years will participate in this international project and will be mentored by French scientists while gaining hands-on experience with advanced research tools. 
This IRES project is focused on atmospheric chemistry and will contribute to the better understanding of clean air and global warming.

Phenolic compounds, which are produced during biomass burning and from the oxidation of anthropogenic aromatic precursors, are believed to be significant sources of brown carbon aerosol when oxidized in cloud droplets, especially in the presence of iron (from dust) or nitrogen oxides (from combustion pollution).  However, multi-phase reactions of phenolic compounds have been studied mainly in bulk aqueous solutions rather than in more realistic nanodroplets, where photobleaching can become photobrowning and where reactivity is often accelerated, especially for surface-active oligomerizing species. The researchers will therefore study brown secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation by phenolic precursor species in nanodroplet "cloud simulation" photooxidation experiments at the CESAM chamber in Paris, characterizing chemical and optical changes in aerosol particles before, during, and after cloud events. Particle browning will be monitored by CAPS-ssa and UV/visible spectroscopy of water-soluble OA as the reactants interact with seed aerosol, water droplets, and simulated sunlight in the pressure, temperature, and RH-controlled chamber. Particle-phase chemistry will be monitored by aerosol mass spectrometry (ACSM-TOF), and particle uptake and outgassing will be detected by high-resolution PTR-MS and long-path FTIR monitoring of gas- phase species.  This project will provide 15 diverse U.S. undergraduates with international research experiences at a state-of-the-art cloud chamber facility as the center of a 3-semester research experience for each participant.  Project activities will increase understanding of important sources of brown SOA, which will in turn allow this pollutant, and the adverse effects on human health and climate that it causes, to be minimized in a more cost-effective manner.

Twelve Native American students from five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota will participate in a six-week summer program over the course of three years. Each year, four students will form a cohort and participate in pre-training in the U.S. and then visit and study at the host University in Beijing, China for five weeks. All three student cohorts will focus on one unifying topic - building and testing an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled environmental monitoring system. During the course of the research training and after the project is finished, a deep and comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to assess three key aspects of the program: 1) instructional training and research experience, 2) global professional and cultural experience; and 3) student mentoring. This program will greatly benefit participating students. This is an international learning experience that may be the key highlight of student participants' academic careers, which may be especially true for Native American students, as they have less chances for performing research abroad. The program will provide participating students with unique opportunities to become globally-engaged scientists and to build their international scientific networks. There are five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota that represent historic tribal nations. The recruitment of this program from these Tribal Colleges will ensure a regionally diverse student group will receive international mentoring and research-based education. In many large cities of U.S., there are environmental problems similar to Beijing, so the monitoring technology learned by participating students will provide valuable reference and an essential technology reserve. The participating students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of China from Beijing, the culture center of China.

Student participants will learn to design advanced environmental monitoring systems that integrate energy harvest and remote control, which can track all four categories of environmental contaminants including metals, radioisotopes, volatile organic contaminants, and biological contaminants. In this project, tasks for student participants include sensor developments, interface circuits designs, wireless sensor network designs for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems to realize environmental monitoring, testing the proposed monitoring system on laboratory and field sites, and making reliability-based lifetime analyses. The proposed system is a much-needed technology for environmental decision-making that will help substantially reduce ecological and human-health threats from environmental problems, and the implemented prototype and test data will be a significant reference for the other academic researchers and industrial developers. Evaluation data collection will occur sequentially using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The primary goals of this program are to: 1) provide students with training and mentoring in international-based engineering applications that will create a positive effect in their professional and personal lives, 2) create Native American experts in environmental monitoring and protection, and 3) improve specialized environmental management in the remote areas.

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

The objective of USC's I-Corps Site is to establish a sustainable innovation ecosystem with strong links to the local entrepreneurial community. This Site nurtures science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and students who are engaged in projects with potential to be transitioned into the marketplace using an integrated entrepreneurship curricula, business mentorship, and assignment of resources to early stage discoveries. 

The USC I-Corps Site increases awareness and piques the interest of students and faculty in technology, expands the engagement of seasoned entrepreneurs and investors with researchers, and advances the translation of discoveries to commercial applications. The program encompasses three major tasks: (1) enhances entrepreneurial training based on the Lean LaunchPad methodology, (2) expands USC's current engagement with seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to foster mentoring of junior entrepreneurs. This is accomplished through a three-tier strategy that entails one-on-one mentoring, an Expert-in-Residence program, student internships in start-ups, and (3) fosters outreach activities by disseminating the program curricular activities and best practices, and directing strategies to enhance participation of underrepresented groups. 

The USC Site program addresses critical barriers to the growth of academic entrepreneurship by providing an experiential learning framework with an emphasis on customer discovery, networking, and strategic partnerships. The tangible outcomes include new opportunities for research funding, strengthened academia-industrial connections, and unique exposure of students to real world translational research. A secondary outcome of this program is the evolution of academic culture that values entrepreneurship and is more proactive in taking risk and finding resources to bring ideas to reality. This transition in academic culture enhances USC?s efforts to attract students in STEM fields and strengthens its role in economic development and job creation.

The outreach portion of this Site is geared toward improving diversity inclusion and enhancing participation of underrepresented groups through a wider dissemination of educational activities. The broader impacts are four-fold. First, the educational framework offers an immersive experience that prepares students to identify and pursue high impact opportunities regardless of their vocation. Second, it fosters the innovation ecosystem by promoting collaborations between faculty and business partners. This stimulates the commercial translation of fundamental research, and exposes the local business community to USC's research capacity. Third, it puts in place a robust framework for I-Corps team formation to enhance the chance of success of USC entrepreneurs in competing for SBIR/STTR and follow-on funding. Fourth, the program facilitates the development of a unique model for an entrepreneurial ecosystem that combines the best practices from Silicon Valley with the distinct resources and assets available in the Southeast."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly improve end-users' data analysis productivity and result accuracy. The Resource Enhancement and Advanced Discovery System (READS) technology streamlines users approaches to locating the most relevant analytic tools for their specific problems through natural language capabilities.  While focusing on geoscientists, financial analysts, and biotechnologists as potential users at the inception of this I-Corps project, READS can be customized for any discipline and its specific data analytic tool requirements.  The three user examples listed above are only the beginning of the potential applications for which this analytic tool discovery system can be utilized.  The ability to query resources with discipline-specific language and increase result accuracy by annotating the queried resources with domain-specific terminology will drastically reduce the amount of time required to locate requisite tools, and ultimately attract users.  New users will not need to start from scratch in their analyses, but will be able to build upon the resources discovered by others, therefore maximizing productivity.  This broad range of appeal, combined with an accessible user interface not seen in other tools, underscores the potential for significant commercial impact of this technology.

This I-Corps project   aims to assist users in easily locating the "best" analytic tools for their specific task through an analytic tool discovery system for interdisciplinary data analysis. Data manipulation challenges are emerging and the integration of dataset analytic tools into a comprehensive framework is needed to further knowledge discovery.  Abundant tools and methods are available to the research and business communities to analyze datasets across disciplines, but it is often difficult to locate the most relevant tools for a specific task. Adding context to queries greatly enhances a users' ability to retrieve requisite analytic tools.  READS integrates analytic tool information into a one-stop-shop retrieval system capable of accessing valuable metadata from multiple repositories.  The system allows end-users to retrieve analytic tool information by submitting either keyword-based queries and/or free text-based questions.  The system leverages natural language processing, text mining, and an ontology-based metadata annotation system to allow collections of analytic tools and methods to be linked and discovered with high accuracy.  This allows end-users to discover, reuse, validate, share, and exchange knowledge related to their chosen data analytic tools. This novel approach facilitates the accessible analysis of cross-domain datasets, greatly enhancing end-users' ability to more efficiently answer challenging questions.

The site at USF institutionalizes the Lean LaunchPad training process at the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) and transforms processes in its Technology Transfer Office (TTO) to facilitate faculty and students to transfer STEM research into commercially viable ideas and prototypes. Faculty and students are recruited for this Site using pro-active processes such as: visits to classrooms, capstone design courses, research projects on campus, undergraduate and graduate research displays, individual contacts with faculty with STEM related research grants, and invention disclosures. The TTO also helps teams connect with business mentors by leveraging current contacts. They also are a resource for finding non-NSF funds for innovation-related activities. Faculty from CFE, representing the Colleges of Business, Engineering, Medicine and Sustainability, deliver the NSF training program in a one-week, intensive boot camp format. 

Beyond the prototype stage, USF CONNECT, which is the business arm of USF and at the epicenter of Tampa Bay's innovation ecosystem, supports the I-Corps teams throughout the business life cycle, providing facilities, partners, and resources for business development and access to technologies, workforce programs, technology commercialization, critical research equipment, and incubator facilities. The I-Corps program results in an institutional impact by addressing a crucial gap in the USF innovation ecology in creating prototypes and enhancing design. 

With an I-Corps site, the potential for increasing STEM technology transfer that feeds Tampa Bay's growing innovation ecosystem is high and contributes to transforming the region through high-technology startups. USF is an economic anchor for the Tampa Bay region and a node of the Florida High Tech Corridor that spans a 23-county region in Florida. Most of the state's medical device manufacturing, defense, aerospace, informational technology, and life sciences companies reside in this region. 

USF's diverse student population are also targeted in the I-Corps Sites program. NSF/USF supports the Bridge to the Doctorate and Sloan Minority PhD programs that have enabled USF to be ranked as a top-10 producer of minority (African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino) engineering doctorates. The I-Corps site also nurtures innovation among students who are military veterans, as more than 2,100 veterans and their families are enrolled as students at USF."

Given a complex set of scenarios in which such dyads operate, in some subset of scenarios alerts must be generated, while in other complex scenarios no alerts should be generated.  This project employs machine learning techniques to propose a robust technology that minimizes false alarm rate.  The system will automatically learn about the environment (unsupervised learning) to minimize the false alarm rate.  The smart tethering system consists of hardware and smart software algorithms. Possible applications include child monitoring, patient monitoring and possibly other safety-motivated interventions.

This I-Corps project will further develop a smart tethering technology that integrates sensors, computing platforms, and artificial intelligence. The proposed technology implements a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and deep learning approaches to model the environment to minimize the response error.  Initially the system is trained with training data (GA coupled with deep learning) and then deployed in user's environment.  After deployment, the system smartly learns complex scenarios and customizes to the user's environment based on unsupervised learning approach. The project builds upon prior work in hardware development for smart adaptive systems.   In general, for smart solutions, researchers mostly have employed supervised learning (training based) due to its simplicity. If this research is successful, it will advance the state-of-the-art in the unsupervised learning approach as well as GA based smart systems.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new service technology to improve physical activity engagement by developing personalized physical activity prescriptions with market-available exergames and fitness mobile applications (fitness app). This technology is a theory- and research-based service process that targets maintaining physical activity engagement. The application has the potential to improve fitness function in individuals at any age and in any physical condition when he/she engages in physical activity. The technology can have several broader impacts on society: (1) as a nation, we are in need of creative solutions to improve the general health and fitness of our citizens; (2) according to the US Census bureau, in 2050, the 65+ age population is predicted to be over 80 million (twice that in 2012) who need to be fit; and (3) chronic illnesses result in significant reduction in productivity of the working population - the severity of illness can be reduced by improving the fitness of the individual.

This I-Corps project aims (1) to determine what the customer segments and value propositions are for the technology; (2) to identify in what format the application should be delivered to make a market/product fit; and (3) to establish the readiness to transit the technology as an automated marketable service product. As of today, the technology exists as a manually prescribing procedure for patients who suffer from fatigue symptom. It has been thoroughly validated by pilot tests. Personalization features gauge and match multi-level factors, so the likelihood of adherence to the physical activity prescription is very high. The Exergame Grading Scheme is used to rate intensity of fitness attributes and energy expenditure of exergames and fitness app. The personalized physical activity prescriptions are generated by the Exergame Grading Scheme based algorithm, so that the prescription can challenge the individual's functional capacity. The intellectual merit lies in: (1) identifying the right combination of hardware/software technologies that can accurately implement the product; and (2) implementing a solution that is scalable in mass volumes with low cost per unit.

Although there have been a number of efforts to develop low-cost, efficient methods to treat water and wastewater, many of them fail in practice due to the lack of understanding of social and economic factors, and the lack of community engagement. This project will engage fifteen (15) IRES participants and three (3) graduate assistants from STEM, STEM education, public health and social sciences in carrying out research to develop, test and implement the technologies, such as biosand filters and decentralized sanitation systems, while uncovering and addressing social factors that limit their use in the field. The project will take place in collaboration with students and faculty at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), as well as teachers and pupils in a local secondary school in Kumasi, Ghana.  US students will experience real on-the-ground water and sanitation situations that will enhance their research skills as they develop the global competence needed to work effectively in developing countries.  Specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of US students engaging in global water and sanitation research, 2) enhance student understanding of the complexity of water and sanitation challenges and increase their global competency, 3) engage secondary school teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic science and participatory action research, and 4) develop strong collaborations between USF and KNUST for water and sanitation research and education.

The participating research teams will advance research and development of: 1) biosand filters that simultaneously address infectious disease and dental/skeletal health risks that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2) decentralized ecological sanitation technologies, such as constructed wetlands, urine diverting dry toilets and biodigesters, which recover valuable resources (water, nutrients, energy) from human wastes.  Each team will work on technology development, appropriate financing mechanisms and effective behavioral and educational approaches to improve WASH practices. 

IRES participants will directly experience WASH research in the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana.  These experiences will enhance their understanding of WASH challenges and build their global competency.  We will recruit female and underrepresented minority students through programs and clubs that emphasize diversity, community colleges and minority serving institutions.  Extensive professional development and mentoring programs are planned for IRES participants.  Results will be integrated into courses taught by the PIs and outreach to the Tampa Bay community, K12 science teachers and students.  The project will strengthen the partnership between USF and KNUST and create opportunities for future collaborations, particularly in WASH research.

The project will also include research into detailed 3D mapping of urban areas using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods; specifically the project will map portions of Houston/Corpus Christi in Texas, and Tampa/Saint Petersburg in Florida, using Kite Photography and light aircraft. The production of land cover maps and digital elevation models requires the fusion of very large amounts of disparate data and efficient, automated techniques. The project will develop the strategies to aggregate these data into useful products using Google Earth Engine and a High Performance Computing cluster. The project will distribute all products openly via NOAA's Digital Coastal portal.

"abstractText": "This project focuses on investigating a new paradigm in renewable energy harvesting that would be of great use for developing modular power source for use in most of the developing world, and specifically for the continent of Africa.  Currently only 20-23% of the population in Africa has access to electricity.  Large percentage of the population lives far from urban centers.  Only portable energy sources will be able to meet, at least partially, the energy needs of rural populations.  A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in this program will engage in research on a novel concept of renewable energy harvesting.  They will develop working modules that will be tested in the field with the aim of producing efficient portable energy sources to improve the lives of people living in rural Africa.  In addition, the cultural experience gained through interactions with the tribal communities in Africa, and the knowledge gained on the way of life in each tribe, their societal rules and norms, and the struggles they face in day-to-day life, will transform their view of the world.  Their efforts will be highly rewarding, as they will be contributing to increase the renewable and portable power generation in these remote areas that will greatly improve the quality of life for the segment of the world population that is lagging behind the norms. 
To implement the project the PI at the University of South Florida (USF) will collaborate with the researchers at the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST).  After completing a 3-week research program at USF, students will travel to Botswana and will team up with a cohort of students at BIUST for a 5-week period where they will learn, live, work, and travel together. 

The primary goal of research is to study the feasibility of combining thermoelectric modules and solar devices to generate much higher electrical power than what is possible with individual devices.  Thermoelectric modules formed with materials of high Seebeck coefficient can produce high voltages but low conductivity that leads to low currents.  Typical solar cell open-circuit voltages are relatively low, but high absorption of radiation can generate high density of carriers.  However, high carrier recombination losses lead to low short circuit current.  This project will investigate a novel paradigm in which the relatively high voltage (1-4 V) produced by the thermoelectric modules from the recovery of waste heat of cooking stoves used in rural Africa will be used to reverse-bias the solar cell for generating a high photo-generated current.  The combination of the high voltage, high current, combined with a suitable circuit design, has the potential to enhance power generation and more efficient charging of batteries or capacitors.  The outcome will be educating a cohort of graduate and undereducated students on energy challenges of the rural communities in the world, and developing innovative concepts based on fundamental science to resolve issues of the global society. Though the initial effort is to develop a power source for rural Africa, the concept can be extended to multitude of commercial products and military applications where power can be generated when plugging into the power grid is not an option.

"abstractText": "The Los Angeles economy, the nation's second largest, is anchored by the health care, aerospace and defense industries. It is now also home to the rapidly growing Silicon Beach technology corridor, which spawns exciting new startups in software, digital and interactive media, renewable energy and a plethora of others. With one of the largest populations of graduating engineers in the country and a large manufacturing base, the Los Angeles region is ideally poised for a substantial transformation of its innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The Los Angeles Regional I-Corps Node will help accelerate this transformation, by helping to increase the potential for leveraging the region's products and services. The University of Southern California led Node, consisting of a partnership between the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles, and the California Institute of Technology, will improve the region's ecosystem by: modeling how to leverage regional strengths to support commercialization nationally; studying team and customer-network formation; aligning technology and organizational maturity paths; and determining institutional support mechanisms to accelerate team coalescence, technology-to-product transformation, and customer acquisition. The Node will contribute to the NSF's mission of empowering STEM students, technical professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to actively and effectively translate innovative ideas into large-scale commercialization. Annual I-Corps training sessions will be created that combine the strength of the partner institutions to offer new regional entrepreneurial opportunities and contribute novel resources to the I-Corps National Innovation Network (NIN). Two efforts will specifically focus on extending the Lean Start-up model to established industries in the Los Angeles region. The first will focus on health-care engineering, including a 'Mobile Demo Day' that will educate researchers on the convergence of engineering and medicine, regulatory hurdles, insurance strategies, medical industry distribution models, and related issues. The second will focus on aerospace and defense; offering unparalleled access to insight, mentoring, and opportunities to technologists in this area, along with strategies that can be used to develop an alignment with large-scale system integrators. 

The Node will provide a vibrant research center for commercialization processes and outcomes. It will examine founding team formation, the coalescence of engineering talent with business skills, and customer and alliance development that cultivates relationships with industry incumbents. The research will also focus on evaluating and improving entrepreneurial skills in technology maturity assessments, understanding the level of technology maturity required for industrial adoption, and identifying institutional support mechanism for accelerating commercialization. The hypothesis that technology and organizational maturity proceed along independent and often unsynchronized timelines will be tested to better understand their interactions and identify factors that will increase success. Data from investors, customers, and advisors will help provide an awareness of each entrepreneur's stakeholder network and recognize correlations involved with both the activity and duration of fundraising. In a similar vein, the Node will study the duration to first sales, acquisition of government grants, and other milestones in cash generation. These factors will be tied to technology development milestones in order to identify relationships and key drivers, such as the importance of prospective customers and investors in accelerating operational cash flow to the company (i.e., through sales, rather than financing). Short-term outcomes will contribute to an understanding of the relative importance of various roles and dependencies. Longer-term outcomes will contribute to an improvement in the performance of regional teams. The Node's website will contribute videos, slide decks, and related materials to the NIN, including a 'Needs and Deals' section where local deals that seek specialized guidance will be advertised. The website will also post bios and contact information for vetted mentors who can assist companies in other regions of the country."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercialization potential of this I-Corps project involves the application of multi-sensor technologies to  improve the management and treatment of patients with implanted catheters. Catheter blockage and failure results in ineffective treatment, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients are particularly vulnerable due to their life-long dependence on implanted catheters and suffer significantly due to high implant failure rate (>40% in year 1, >80% within a decade). Over one million Americans currently live with hydrocephalus, and require constant drainage of cerebrospinal fluid via implanted catheter. Repeated imaging studies and invasive procedures are used to monitor catheter performance, but these methods are expensive and inadequate. MRI/CT imaging can identify catheter failure in fewer than 50% of cases. Even when combined with invasive tests, patients are often misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of hydrocephalus catheter status could eliminate expensive tests and unnecessary operations, saving the US healthcare system $2 billion annually and immeasurably improve patient quality of life. Numerous other diseases in the cardiovascular, urinary, and renal spaces also require chronically implanted catheters and would benefit from noninvasive catheter monitoring. Improving catheter monitoring would also increase scientific knowledge of chronic diseases, providing an important tool for research and therapy development.

This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential for a multi-sensor catheter which can be implanted in the human body. Few sensors exist on the market that can operate for long periods in the human body. There are no suitable sensor technologies for chronically implanted catheters. This team developed a new sensor technology based on microscale electrodes that are low profile and eliminate the need for encapsulation or protection against the harsh environments found in vivo. They are made only of inert biocompatible materials, such as platinum and Parylene C, which have long been used in FDA approved medical implants. The pressure sensor operates by monitoring the response of a microbubble to changes in pressure. The flow sensor uses a microscopic heater and electrodes to measure heat transfer via flowing fluid. The sensor measures the electrical signal between electrodes inside and outside of a catheter to measure blockage. Clinical tests of these sensors are currently underway in pediatric patients with external ventricular drains.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to accelerate and control gene delivery, and to allow researchers to find novel solutions to challenging diseases.  Gene delivery, also known as transfection, is a promising approach to treat diseases such as cancer and, thus, could provide a profound benefit to society.  Using gene therapy and immune-therapy, gene delivery allows for the efficient introduction of a new gene into cells. The specific technology employed offers a photo-responsive, nanoparticle-based technique with the advantages of higher efficacy, controlled gene-release, and faster transfection rates.  This has the potential to dramatically decrease the time required for transfection, as well as greatly reducing the required amount of gene and/or drug.  Thus, along with providing researchers the unique ability to control the process through a simple light trigger, this technology could provide substantial commercial impact.

This I-Corps project is a gene delivery tool that utilizes two biocompatible surfactants which associate spontaneously into light-sensitive nanoparticles when dissolved in water.  Nucleic acids (DNA/siRNA) can be loaded inside of the nanoparticles to protect the nucleic acids until they reach the interior of cells.  Similarly, hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug molecules can also be carried within the nanoparticles.  Subsequent exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light leads to nanoparticle dissociation, resulting in the triggered release of nucleic acids, which can then modify the DNA of the cell or stop disease-associated protein production.  Researchers would be able to utilize this gene delivery technology in two different ways: (1) substitution of new genes to the cell, or (2) inactivation of existing genes.  The combination of lower costs (of both the carrier components and the nucleic acids due to higher efficiencies) and faster delivery/transfection rates with our technology compared to current gene-delivery technologies could have a considerable impact throughout the industry."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to substantially reduce green house gas (GHG) emissions from landfills, industry, and transportation, while providing a zero-emission fuel to collectively contribute towards a more sustainable, closed-loop economy. Fuel cell technologies are a solution that has the potential to transform transportation industry with zero tailpipe emissions like electric cars, but with mileage range similar to gasoline and diesel fuel.  Additionally, stationary fuel cells can provide a zero emission electricity source.  Developing a viable system to convert organic waste into renewable hydrogen in a modular, decentralized fashion can be a paradigm changer for hydrogen supply and the fuel cell market while solving additional societal issues surrounding food waste and fossil fuel emissions. 

This I-Corps project proposes to develop a modular microbial electrolysis stack system capable of continuous high-rate hydrogen production from food waste. The innovation is based on electron or electricity producing bacteria, which generate current from organic waste and a device that Electro-Active has developed to enable high-rate hydrogen production from that current. It incorporates optimized reactor design and operation to sustain productivities typically seen only with pure substrates. To demonstrate proof-of-concept for this technology, target productivities and price point must be demonstrated in a larger reactor unit over a longer period of time. Sustained performance requires high-rate biocatalytic conversion of feedstock, and high-rate proton transport to the cathode. To overcome these challenges, a patented microbial enrichment process has been created to develop a robust microbial community capable of converting complex waste into electrons at high rates and efficiency. Additionally, preliminary data with robust biocatalyst, novel reactor design and operation provides evidence that the integrated approach can overcome these limitations.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to optimize outcomes for patients with certain kinds of heart disease and thus reduce healthcare costs. We have developed a virtual reality surgical planning tool which allows us to better understand which patients are at high risk, and better plan surgeries for them. If this tool becomes widely used, the benefits could include improving overall outcomes for people with structural heart disease, leading to fewer reinterventions, shorter hospital stays, lower healthcare costs, and improved quality of life. In addition, these tools may also be useful to neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons. Finally, if medical education is improved through virtual reality, this would lead to better physicians with more knowledge of anatomy. Regarding commercial impact, the project has multiple potential commercialization pathways. First, end users such as pediatric cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons can use the virtual reality surgical planning tool for their own patients. Further, medical device companies that make valves could use the software to teach physicians optimal ways to use their products, and to differentiate from their competitors. Finally, imaging companies could package this as the next stage of radiology interpretation software. 

This I-Corps project focuses on planning structural heart disease interventions and surgeries using true 3D visualization with modern virtual reality techniques. These interventions require a detailed understanding of how different parts of the anatomy relate to each other in space. The development of true 3D visualization has enabled new ways of understanding these relationships. Already, it has been shown that the use of 3D printing in planning complex cases of congenital heart disease can improve surgical decision-making. This resulted in fewer cases where the surgeon had to change her mind about which surgery to perform after opening the chest. One would therefore expect better outcomes and greater patient satisfaction if the expected procedure is done. In addition, early reports suggest that virtual reality may be useful in improving surgical education. The virtual reality system in this project has already been used to plan innovative heart interventions that were previously not considered feasible. What is yet unknown is the extent of the effect on longer-term patient outcomes, both within congenital heart disease and in adult structural heart disease. Further development of virtual reality surgical planning tools will allow the field to advance as we investigate the contribution virtual reality can make.

Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.

This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration. These results indicated the possibility of overcoming the current shortcomings in osseous tissue regeneration.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the proposed technology provides a much-needed solution to the current problems in electrosurgery that is widely used in many medical specialties such as neurological surgery. Electrosurgery is fast and requires short post-surgery recovery time; however, major problems such as collateral nerve damage and seal failure still exist, sometimes with fatal consequences. The proposed technology helps eliminate those problems by monitoring the electrosurgical process with an acoustic signal. It will enable an assistive device for surgeons to make precise decisions that will ensure the surgical quality. It will reduce surgeon fatigue, time in the operating room, and healthcare cost, while improving the overall patient experience. This project allows extensive customer discovery and market analysis, from which commercial products will be developed to satisfy the needs of patients, surgeons, and hospitals. With the projected $5.17B global market for electrosurgical equipment by 2021, the proposed technology will have a significant commercial potential. The monitoring methodology applied to this project brings advances to the field of precision surgery with engineering principles. 

This I-Corps project focuses on developing a real-time acoustic signal monitoring system for quality assurance of the electrosurgical process. First, sound signals captured during the surgery is correlated to the water boiling and protein denaturing process in heated tissue. Then, a decision-making algorithm is developed based on the signal strength and number of bubble bursting events. Previous research on the electrosurgical process has provided fundamental understanding and suggested that the acoustic monitoring method is dramatically better than existing ones. In the previous study, experiments was conducted with ex-vivo porcine tissue and the feasibility of the proposed technology using a low-profile sensor was demonstrated. This I-Corps award will provide opportunities to conduct customer interviews for technology refinement. A set of functional requirements for product development will be identified to support commercialization of the proposed technology.

"abstractText": "IRES: Closing Oceans: Assessing the Dynamics of Turkish suture zones
PI: Catlos, co-PI: Elliott, Kyle

PART 1:
This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate suture zones,i.e.locations where ancient ocean basins closed across the country. Turkey contains a large number of these zones, which are key locations used by geologists to understand how continents grow. Continental growth is considered one of the most important problems facing Earth Scientists, yet models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of geologic record. Because of its extensive outcrops of ancient rocks associated with suture zones, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process.

The IRES program has societal value, as Turkey's suture zones can be associated with important ore and mineral resources or are regions of major, present-day geologic hazards. Older faults that worked to close the ocean basins today form regions of active earthquake activity or have generated topography that leads to large landslides. Understanding the locations and ages of Turkey's ancient suture zones has an impact on diverse topics, including mineral exploration and hazard reduction. This proposal includes partnerships with faculty at three Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a range of geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust. Students will apply innovative methods to address scientific questions involving both the timing and impacts of Turkey's suture zones, including electronic-based field mapping techniques and new geochemical approaches. This in turn will lead to insight into how the past geological history of Turkey impacts its present day concerns, including the development of economically important resources and hazard mitigation.  


PART 2:
Understanding how continents grow is recognized as one of the most important geodynamic problems facing Earth Scientists. Models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of exposure of the geologic record. Because of its extensive exposures of ancient ocean suture zones and crustal fragments, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate the arc accretion processes that occurred in Turkey during the closure of branches of ancient ocean basins.

In addition, the IRES program has societal value, as paleogeographic reconstructions are used to identify important economic resources that formed during specific times in Earth's history and assess geologic hazards that result due to reactivation of older faults or mass movement of rocks. This proposal includes partnerships with faculty at 3 Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a multidisciplinary range of geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust. Students will apply new and innovative field mapping, geochemical, and geochronological methods, lending greater insight into the history and mechanics of the assembly of Turkey."

"abstractText": "This award supports international research experiences for U.S. undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) at the University of Victoria (UVic) in Canada in interdisciplinary research representing the fields of bioengineering and neuroscience. The project engages primarily Hispanic engineering students at UTEP, a majority Hispanic 4-year, public institution. Reciprocal visits to UTEP by UVic students will be supported with Canadian funds.  UTEP students will be afforded professional development and educational opportunities in cutting-edge research.  Specifically, the project engages the synergism of stem cell biology with advanced 3-dimensional biomaterial technology to manufacture tissue from stem cells. Generating patient-specific "artificial" tissue allows the researchers to control the rate of growth and differentiation of stem cells.  This research is significant in paving the way for modeling disease and for future drug development.  

Working together, the interdisciplinary team aims to identify unique approaches of targeting differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] into neural phenotypes by utilizing advanced materials and processing. Specifically, the UTEP team has expertise in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture and 3D bioprinting, and UVic has expertise in culturing neuronal differentiation of human iPSC on fibrin-based scaffolds. The research focus is the application of microfluidic-based 3D bioprinting for coprinting of human iPSCs together with biomaterial scaffolds to generate bio-composites of the desired architecture with high fidelity. Bioprinting iPSCs with advanced biomaterials and scaffolds bears the promise to develop 3D tissues, ideally including encapsulated cells and facilitating their proliferation, and targeted differentiation. The project enables addressing critical questions in the field: 1) How can advanced materials and their unique designs facilitate stem cell culture and promote their differentiation? 2) How can 3D bioprinting be applied as an advanced manufacturing technique to mimic the complex environment for regulating growth and differentiation of stem cells? 3) Does the differentiated progeny of cells cultured atop micro-textured scaffolds exhibit enhanced functionality and phenotype, compared with controls? Thus, the scientific goal is to better understand the role of growth factors and micro-environmental niche and cues released from biomaterial scaffolds in the regulation of adult human iPSC differentiation into neural phenotypes. It is widely known that distractive biomaterial scaffolds that incorporate patterned structures and specific compartments of growth factors can more intricately guide stem cell development. Achieving this goal enables the ability to address fundamental neurobiological questions about neuronal growth, differentiation, which is essential for designing treatments for nervous system disorders or traumatic brain injury.

In addition to fulfilling the Site goals, UTSA is also studying and working with I-Corps teams to develop a deeper understanding of the educational constructs associated with identifying and nurturing nascent technology entrepreneurs. Together these suggest new paradigms for designing technology commercialization programs and their impact on university-industry innovation ecosystems. 

The SITE at UTSA has broader impacts that include the creation of a transformational and progressive entrepreneurial ecosystem within the university environment that is essential to foster, support, develop, and commercialize new technologies. Such an ecosystem will not only help to change academic mindsets and cultures, but also result in higher competitiveness in global markets, increased external funding via follow-up research dollars, an enhanced educational environment for students and faculty, increased marketability of UT graduates, and greater financial returns to the university and community via technology commercialization. In addition, as a minority serving institution with a focus on veterans, UTSA has been very successful in achieving diversity among their teams. With continued support and NSF I-Corps designation, the CITE will expand its network of partnerships through the I-Corps Nodes, the NIN, and the growing number of regional partners."

Knowledge of statistical methods often does not translate to application to current research questions. The proposed project aims to reduce the time corporations and large and small organizations need in training new data analyst employees. Additionally, the project aims to reduce errors in judgment regarding the application of appropriate statistical tests to particular problems. Commercially, the project may replace libraries of statistical reference manuals utilized to make decisions about application of statistical models.

This I-Corps project leverages academic research in statistics to application in real-world research contexts such as data analysis in medical research centers. The project is designed to assist quantitative data analysts in moving from hypothesis to interpretation of statistical results through a simple series of decision steps, using parameters known to analysts across a variety of contexts. The prototype was built using a puzzle/maze typology. Current market available tools are limited in scope of statistical tests, and do not provide demonstration of the test in action with hypothetical data. The current project prototype covers 28 different parametric and non-parametric statistical tests appropriate across all four quantitative data types: categorical, ordinal, interval, and ratio-level data. Additionally, the current prototype provides demonstration of all 28 tests via video-link using sample data, provide output results, and demonstration of appropriate reporting.

The University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a new means of creating broad-spectrum antimicrobial fabric treatments with a low barrier to entry for manufacturers. This technology promises to deliver antimicrobial coatings at lower overall economic and environmental costs, by reducing solvent usage, waste, and coating loss. Antimicrobial treatments are already used in medicine, as anti-infective treatments of bandages, catheters, and other medical items, and in garments and textiles, as anti-odor treatments. The lower barrier to entry for garment manufacturers is expected to enable more widespread adoption of the technology, which in turn will reduce material and energy waste from excessive laundering and save consumers money. The technology can be adapted to a wide range of fiber types and can be applied without specialized equipment, facilitating the integration into existing manufacturing processes and giving manufacturers access to premium market segments with minimal upfront investment. 


This I-Corps project will help improve the market penetration of antimicrobial treatments, which in turn will provide consumers with superior garment performance at reduced environmental and economic costs. The technology uses a new form of soluble silver metal, developed by prior NSF funded research, and an innovative method to coat a variety of different fiber types with bioactive silver, which enables the antimicrobial coatings to be applied at any stage in the manufacturing process. Proof of concept has been demonstrated with basic prototyping, but development of the technology for specific markets and applications demands a better understanding of customer needs. This I-Corps team project is aimed at discovering those customer needs, through extensive customer interviews, in order to inform the development and engineering of products that meet each particular market specific need that is identified.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is by improving the quality of life of prostate and potentially other pelvic cancer patients who receive radiation therapy (RT). Followed by skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society's estimate for prostate cancer in the United States for 2018 was 164,690 new cases. Most of these cases will receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment. The new trend in RT is to deliver a much higher dose of radiation per fraction in a smaller number of fractions while reducing the required number of RT sessions. However, during RT of the prostate, the rectum acts as a limiting factor. Due to the proximity of rectum to prostate, increasing dosage of the radiation can affect the rectal wall and increase risk of cancer in rectum. The device developed here allows for the expedited treatment plans while eliminating the undesirable damage to the rectal tissue.  This can greatly improve a patient's quality of life after completion of radiation treatment. The use of our device reduces the overall required time for the radiation therapy of prostate cancer and saves money for health care providers, health insurances, and patients.

This I-Corps project leverages the functionality of nickel titanium to retract the rectum away from the prostate during radiation beam therapy of prostate cancer. This will be a minimally invasive device that uses the biomimetic actuation of the material to create distance between rectum and prostate. NiTi as a biocompatible shape memory alloy is an ideal candidate for biomimetic and biocompatible devices. A control systems design is combined with thermomechanical functionality of the alloy to generate the desired range of motion and profile of force. The actuation takes place by passing a small electrical current in a reliable, clean, and silent manner. This type of actuation is potentially inherently safer when compared to most other means of actuation, because it has a limited range of motion beyond which applying more electrical current does not create further motion.

This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

The University of Utah I-Corps Site program encourages and assists students and faculty in transitioning research projects to commercialization by providing education, training, resources and networking required for understanding markets, customers, product-market fit and to answer business and/or technology questions. The I-Corps Site program at the University of Utah is currently in its 3rd year and has trained nearly 90 teams and over 150 participants. The program resulted in successful business and technology go/no-go decisions, successful transition to commercialization, and helped advance five technologies to the commercial start-up stage. This extension focuses on refining the curriculum by implementing lessons learned in the first three years of the program, developing new teams and generating more successful transitions, as well as implementing the new financing model that will assure future program sustainability without further government funding.

The Utah I-Corps Site enhances and builds upon this institution's existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. This Site initiated the development of a model of transitioning from research-based technologies to viable commercial products in academic environment that allows the university to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of underrepresented participants. This extension further generalizes and disseminates the developed curriculum and implements agreements and procedures to assure its future financial sustainability. Partnership networks within the university support underrepresented student and faculty groups and offer the support and resources needed to help such groups thrive and participate in the process and, as the program becomes self-sustaining, will be extended, through internships and special courses to other colleges and local high schools. Thus, the program helps increase the diversity of the regional business environment leading to enhanced growth and economic prosperity for all citizens in the region."

At the end of the program participants will be equipped with key experimental skills and background tailored for the specific needs of organic electronics research and technology that bridge physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and condensed matter physics. Three PhDs and twelve undergraduate US students will spend ten weeks working in teams with the Japanese mentors and their students on interdisciplinary projects specifically designed to leverage the ongoing collaboration on small molecules electronics between the US and Japanese participants. The students will learn specific experimental techniques while immersed in a new, culturally -distinct collaborative environment. They will gain unprecedented access to fabrication and characterization techniques inaccessible at their home institution. Students will undergo a two-week intensive language training specifically focused on laboratory work communication and become part of the cultural immersion activities at Yamagata University. The group also benefits from the contribution of a school of education faculty member that will conduct assessment activities resulting in best practices recommendations for a Global Scientist certificate offering at the University of Vermont.  A semester -long recruitment plan will focus on women and minorities from small or HBCU colleges in the northeastern United States.

For the past ten years, synthetic chemistry efforts that produced soluble derivatives of small molecule semiconductors led to macroscopically-ordered crystalline thin films and scalable, cost-effective roll-to-roll processing techniques that promise a future where flexible, bio-integrated, or disposable electronics may play a significant role in our everyday lives. Though these advances have been incredibly significant, the performance metrics of organic semiconductor-based transistors, LEDs, and solar cells are still far behind (to varying degrees) their crystalline inorganic counterparts.  The scientific and engineering communities are at a turning point where the next major step forward can only be realized with novel interdisciplinary approaches based on a fundamental understanding of the electronic and excitonic properties. 
The Vermont -Yamagata IRES partnership will foster and nurture a new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists, that will become experts ready to tackle the grand challenges of small molecule electronics. The underlying scientific theme of the student projects investigates correlations between long-range order, the nature of intermolecular interactions, and electronic properties in small molecule families. It seeks ways of exploiting these correlations towards establishing design rules for optimization of electronic and excitonic properties of small molecule thin films. Such design rules lead to avenues for affordable, sustainable, organic device platforms for a variety of applications including photovoltaics, flexible electronics, and bio-interfacing. The proposed experimental work will also trigger theoretical questions related to bridging the quantum chemistry body of knowledge with condensed matter approaches that take into account long range interactions, thus building an interdisciplinary model for excitonic and charge carrier behavior in these systems.

UW will apply I-Corps Site funding to qualified teams for the purpose of initiating and developing specific customer relationships. They will solicit Site teams from three overlapping pipelines of emerging start-ups at the UW: UW Center for Commercialization; the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship; and the Clean Energy Initiative, with overlapping pipelines of technology start-ups and of student-led start-ups. With a Site award, UW addresses customer development within the I-Corps framework. 

Broader Impacts:
UW has been actively participating in state-level and regional entrepreneurial strategies for the past six years. Their involvement in the I-Corps national network expands their coherent effort to execute a national strategy. Also, to help drive the regional innovation economy around Seattle and the Puget Sound, UW has developed its own ecosystem for technology entrepreneurship. An I-Corps Site award will expand participant?s entrepreneurial experience, especially for students, by emphasizing the importance of early and frequent interactions with potential customers. This would directly improve the quality and momentum of the start-ups in UW's pipeline, which translates into healthier company starts in Washington State."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Project is to conduct customer discovery interviews to identify initial customers that can support a universal medication autoinjector platform technology that can democratize accessibility to medications.  A direct ampule autoinjector system can leverage the existing global medical infrastructure of the ampule-based medication cartridge while expanding accessibility of medications.  From a cost effectiveness and cost minimization perspective, an equally safe and efficacious drug delivery platform technology will require complex advancements in the scientific and technological understanding of injection systems that can deliver a consistent dose of medication free of particulate contamination, air bubbles, and is also user intuitive with little to no technical training.  The potential societal impact of this technology can save many lives since having wider access to this technology can prevent death or disability that can arise if patients undergoing medical situations are not treated quickly.  This platform technology can also protect emergency responders, civilians and military personnel exposed to biological or chemical threats.  The potential commercial impact of the project can disrupt the multi-billion-dollar health care market, democratize health care access, while being capable of expanding into global markets.

This I-Corps project will further the development and commercialization of direct ampule-based autoinjector technology through customer discovery.  Technical results of the feasibility of the technology under development have been proven through the development of a proof of concept that can consistently deliver a volume of medication.  These results have been further refined to the publication of a patent undergoing review.  The NSF sponsored customer discovery program will help the team develop the framework for conducting customer discovery interviews in a structured format while incorporating interview responses and data into a commercialization strategy for product to market execution.  The intellectual merits of the proposed activity will help the team identify how current needs are being addressed regarding the administration of medications while more importantly identifying if those needs are truly met and or if there are other needs that can be met which currently are not met.  The I-Corps customer discovery training program can help the project team identify stakeholders, key opinion leaders and develop a customer segmentation profile that can more accurately identify actual customers and payers in the health care medical device ecosystem while seeking avenues for collaboration in the healthcare industry.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the transformation of the way technical writers and research teams write and edit technical documentation, including data dissemination reports, research proposals, and journal papers. The new toolset will ensure rapid training, high quality, and high levels of innovation in technical and scientific teams. The methodology, implemented in software, will target a broad spectrum of users, from seasoned technical writing teams to emerging solo practitioners; the training materials built into the system will be beneficial for all students and young technical writers who seek to develop more effective writing approaches. The market segmentation is broken into, in the order of market size: 1) large businesses and corporations, 2) academia and educational institutions, 3) government agencies, 4) individuals, and 5) small businesses. Commercialization will require securing partnerships with marketers, university personnel, scholarly journals, and industry professionals, as well as conducting case studies and customer discovery to quantify how the product saves teams time, reduces stress, and delivers training materials for personnel. The resulting product will facilitate the development of strong professional manuscripts for teams of all sizes at other universities and in the industry. 

This I-Corps project seeks to simplify and automate some of the critical obstacles to technical writing, thereby fostering a time-efficient writing and editing environment. In the current collaborative technical writing paradigm, personnel training and inexperience are two of the biggest obstacles to successful (in terms of acceptance rates) technical documentation. Teams that adopt the new writing and editing toolset will find it easier to train new personnel, as well as coordinate writing efforts across a variety of different writing styles and skills. Senior researchers will have more time and resources to focus on the research itself, due to the optimized method of personnel training or mentorship allowed by this system. Over time, the toolset will develop into a methodology that can be broadened to help with any writing discipline, from science and engineering to law or accounting. The toolset was born out of the needs of academic technical writing teams, which produce academic documentation daily. Quantification of impact is segment-dependent. Existing case studies show an improved success of proposal submissions by 40%, with a 60% increase in writing efficiency without loss of quality (in fact, with improved quality, as indicated by the greater success of proposal acceptance).

"abstractText": "This project will send 3 cohorts of 5 students per year for 10 weeks each to conduct research at the University of Bamberg, Germany.  The University of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.  
Our research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people who might spy on them through their data.  Researchers will be implementing and testing their work in the Living Lab Bamberg in Germany to validate the effectiveness of our security systems.  It is expected that this work will result in safer, more intelligent smart cities with the potential to improve energy efficiency, communication, transportation, and public health.

This project will address several scientific challenges in the security and privacy of smart cities. The site at the University of Bamberg was chosen due to the smart city living laboratory that the university operates on both the campus and city.  The researchers will address the following three scientific challenges:  
i) Utilization of data from untrusted sources is critical because many of the data sources in a smart city are the smart phones of users who can intentionally manipulate data or who might have malware on their phone that is strategically manipulating data.  Students will build defense mechanisms using a combination of game theory and machine learning. 
ii) Privacy of users is critical to the adoption of crowd sensing for use in a smart city and to prevent the abuse of the system by users and administrators alike.  Students will build privacy-enhancing technologies that use realistically generated cover traffic to obfuscate user data and cyber-physical correlation to enable privacy-preserving audits of the data collected by the city. 
iii)   Secure incentives help to protect the deployers of tasks from malicious users that are seeking to optimize their gain without contributing to the system.  To ensure that malicious users do not exploit the incentive system, students will create spatio-temporal models of context information that detect if a user was actually at the location at the time they reported they were when contributing information.

"abstractText": "The islands of Oceania are home to diverse fish communities and a vibrant myriad of human cultures, all of which have histories are inseparably tied to characteristics of the ocean and the islands themselves (e.g. resource availability and habitat space), and extent of connectivity among distant islands (e.g. currents, migration, etc.). These unifying concepts between culture and marine ecology make the holistic study of Pacific Island life ideal for a cross-disciplinary research experience.  The PAC-ISLEs program is a year-long research experience punctuated by a six-week trip to Oceania, where students will conduct independent research projects in marine biology and anthropology, and connect the shared themes uniting the two disciplines.  Each year new cohorts will visit a different island in Oceania (American Samoa, Tonga, Pohnpei), where they will immerse themselves in local communities and collaborate with key foreign mentors that possess expertise in community-based conservation, marine ecology, and public education.  Upon returning to the US, students will take advantage of the extensive natural history and ethnology collections at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture to support their research projects, and help them share their findings with the public, including a highly-engaged community of Pacific Islanders in the Seattle metropolitan area and beyond.  

The islands of Oceania support fish communities and human cultures whose histories are inseparably tied to their physical and geographic characteristics (e.g. resource availability and habitat space), and the extent of connectivity among distant islands (e.g. dispersal potential, gene flow, history of human migrations and trade). Students in the PAC-ISLEs program will travel to a unique island each of three years to explore these ties between culture and marine ecology, and characterize historic changes by measuring similarities in cultural objects or traditional activities among islands, and (for fishes) population genetics, taxonomic composition, and phylogeography. Students working with fish communities will focus mainly on the evolution and community structure of cryptobenthic reef fishes, a poorly studied group that can serve as an ideal indicator for evolutionary and contemporary change across Pacific Islands. Students working on Pacific Island anthropology will focus on aspects of culture that are directly linked to the ocean either through their material origins, or role in passing on knowledge about the ocean to future generations. Much like the biological communities of Pacific Islands, cultural items may be compared across different islands to show the history of change, local adaptation, and technological progression. When these data are analyzed and contextualized with existing and extensive biological and anthropological collections from Oceania at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, findings from PAC-ISLEs have the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biological and cultural diversity on and around Pacific Islands, while promoting an equitable exchange of knowledge between scientists and Pacific Islander communities. Student activities extend far beyond the duration of this project, as PAC-ISLEs will help establish a permanent conduit for students to connect with overseas sites that would otherwise be less accessible for students.

"abstractText": "The world is being changed by Big Data, and data science is receiving a remarkably rapid uptake across the nation and the globe as it institutionalized in university curricula, state governance, and industry strategy. Across the sciences, state and industry, new forms of data collection and analysis hold the prospect of our being able to address the major social and scientific issues of our times: from responding to natural disasters to monitoring the environment to developing fundamental technological insights which will revolutionize industry.  None of this will happen by fiat ? the development of the appropriate data analytics must be accompanied by new organizational alignments between research, policy and industry.  The Big Data Hubs and Spokes (BDHubs) program is a key site for analyzing the nature of these alignments with a view to gaining a basic understanding of the stakes as the terrain shifts.  All long-term research and innovation infrastructure must adapt to such ongoing changes. This research will contribute to understanding institutional flexibility: strategies, techniques and organizational innovations to adapt to changes in regulatory, policy and funding environments.  We can expect but not precisely predict, continuing transformations in the sociotechnical, scientific and institutional ecologies of today?s research and scientific infrastructure.  This project will investigate the ongoing activities at the BDHubs and its partner institutions, their emerging plans for the future, and tie these to the long-history of developing research infrastructures (50+ years) to understand the changes we can expect BDHubs to encounter over time (scientific, technological and institutional), and what strategies they employ in the face of transformations to the landscape of science, information technology and institutional environment. 

Many challenges facing contemporary science such as environmental research or chronic disease management require long-term studies and supporting infrastructures. This project will contribute directly to NSF and other efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable knowledge communities across the sciences, industry and government. Improving understanding of the long-term trajectory of research infrastructure will lead to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the part of project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders. Many other science agencies are in the midst of funding such cross-cutting projects. This research will inform science policy and regulatory environments to help develop sustainable and productive research infrastructures. In order to do so, this study will develop a general organizational understanding of the development of large-scale and long-term endeavors in the data sciences and map the institutional landscape of modern data science with particular focus on the activities of infrastructure building, policy development and community formation. In addition, this study will help to develop an understanding of the ?rise of the data sciences? in the US both as an institutional movement and as a form of technical research, with special focus on establishing a framework for evaluating and understanding large-scale, cross-disciplinary collaboration on big data tools, techniques and methods."

Our energy-harvesting subfloor mat can convert normal human walking steps to electricity. The mat is expected to serve the function of 1) a renewable energy source, 2) a power supply for IoT sensors, 3) a self-powered sensor with wireless connectivity. The mat can benefit retail stores and manufacturing companies by helping them analyze the customer/worker locations and foot traffic patterns, and can meet the needs of energy storage and information transmission at heavy foot traffic area like school, airport, stadium. If developed successfully, this mat can be integrated with various floor products and applied across the smart building and IoT industry. This mat also has an environmental impact in which it reduces carbon footprint, promotes use of green natural materials and generation of renewable energy.

This I-Corps project is based on a patent-pending cellulose triboelectric nanogenerator technology.  This technology lies at the intersection of materials science, electrical engineering, and chemistry and chemical engineering, and the research findings can potentially impact the rapidly growing smart building and IoT industry. This technology addresses the technical challenge of developing a thin yet highly effective triboelectric nanogenerator from cheap, abundant natural materials, by bulk tuning of the tribopolarity of natural materials and rational configuration design of the nanogenerator. The bulk tuning and configuration design methodologies developed in this R&D effort can be applied to other relevant areas, including mechanical energy harvester design, and materials surface potential engineering.

"abstractText": "Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a proposal for a Type II I-Corps Site - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.

The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM), in partnership with the UWM Research Foundation (UWMRF), currently operates the NSF I-Corps Site of Southeastern Wisconsin ("Milwaukee I-Corps Site"), which is the only NSF I-Corps site in Wisconsin. The site draws academic teams from five Milwaukee-area academic institutions: UWM, the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), Marquette University (MU), Concordia University of Wisconsin (CUW), and the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). This has been an exemplary I-Corps Site that: reached out across the state; launched a Healthcare initiative; succeeded in inclusiveness, particularly among women; experimented with a variety of curricular offerings; and engaged in entrepreneurship research and published outcomes of their studies.

There is opportunity for launching a homecare equipment market through the adaptive sports clubs and the clinical facilities. The elderly and disabled assistive devices global market was valued at $14 billion in 2015 and is expected to surpass $26 billion by 2024. The outcome of the project will further help researchers, educators, and clinicians to discover new approaches/technology to satisfy unmet needs of customers. This I-Corps project will provide hands on training and experience for an engineering undergraduate student (co-entrepreneurial lead) and graduate student (entrepreneurial lead) on the customer discovery process. The PI will also gain exposure to the customer discovery process, and will incorporate the learnings from this course in ongoing and future projects within his research lab and engineering senior design classes. The project activities are intimately linked to educational activities that will teach students at various levels about the customer discovery process, entrepreneurship, hypothesis testing, etc. 

This I-Corps project will advance understanding of the problems and needs of disabled individuals with upper/lower extremity impairments from different conditions. The intellectual merit of the project lies in the development of a sustainable business model canvas around the proposed technology and in the novel design and development of the proposed robotic assistive arm (R2A). The R2A that we envision is a 7 degrees of freedom anthropomorphic robotic hand that can be mounted on a wheelchair or any mobile platform. It can be controlled either by hand/foot/mouth control depending on the patient?s needs. This will allow the patient, regardless of the disability, to control the robot. The fundamental research conducted so far includes development of an upper-extremity robotic exoskeleton to provide arm movement therapy. This I-Corps project will find the gaps between the customer unmet needs and the approaches/technology currently being used to satisfy their needs. The project activities will unite different customers? problems, needs, and existing solutions; and form a symbiotic relationship to overcome the critical barrier to advancing the field of assistive robotics. Overall, the proposed project will significantly advance the knowledge of how robotic devices can meaningfully and effectively be used in caregiving and rehabilitation.

The late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) was the longest, most widespread glacial interval on Earth after complex, multicellular organisms evolved. Despite the significance of this time interval for understanding contemporary global change, it is understudied in non-tropical regions of Pangea. It is of fundamental importance to establish a deep-time perspective on changing paleoecosystems to predict future perturbations in global systems. We will train future Earth scientists in hypothesis-driven, field-based research in Argentina. The scientific research objectives will be met using fossils, sedimentary rocks, and the geochemistry of these rocks and fossils.

Technical:
We proposed a multi-faceted program of research and student mentorship on late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) paleoecosystems. The LPIA is regarded as the best pre-Quaternary analogue for contemporary global change. Despite the significance of this time interval in the climate history of Earth, our understanding of the response of marine and terrestrial ecosystems to late Paleozoic climate and environmental change remains poorly understood. Our multidisciplinary research will include paleoecological, geochemical, and stratigraphic analyses on extensively preserved floral and faunal fossils in southern and western Argentina. To recruit a broader cross section of the diverse SE Wisconsin area to the Geosciences, our rigorous recruitment and training strategy involves new outreach programs created by the PIs and leveraging existing multi-institutional collaborations. Different cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students will travel with the PIs to Argentina for up to 4 weeks each year to conduct research on paleoclimatic and paleoecologic change during the LPIA. Respected Argentinian specialists will provide expertise on different aspects of LPIA paleoecosystems, including biostratigraphy."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of innovative approaches to create real-world energy-absorbing, customizable materials that may be tailored to a range of markets and applications that provide tangible societal benefits. For example, this new technology could help patients suffering degenerative spinal disc disease by adding  material to replacement intervertebral discs. This application leads to reduced complication rates, improved shock absorption and biocompatibility, and overall increased patient satisfaction. The technology also provides a major public health benefit to athletes, the military, and others by providing superior energy dissipation in protective apparel. One such promising application is an additional lining material in football helmets to reduce the occurrence of concussions. Other potential fields include energy absorbing and vibration damping applications for the automotive or aerospace industries ranging from passenger safety and comfort to isolating critical electronic components in the event of impact, damage, and instability. Each of these applications aims to improve human health and safety, and represents billion dollars a year markets and hundreds of thousands of potential users. 

This I-Corps project will combine the complementary properties of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and nickel-titanium (NiTi) to create a unique composite material that has exceptional mechanical properties, and a high degree of tailorable behavior. Research into LCEs has proven they have excellent energy absorbing behavior and toughness, with performance exceeding that of most other rubber-like materials. However, typical polyurethane rubbers or silicones are inherently soft and/or have a slow recovery from large deformations; this limits its usefulness in many important situations. NiTi is the ideal material to compliment these shortcomings due to its own set of unique characteristics. Similar to metals, it is orders of magnitude stronger and stiffer than LCEs, but NiTi also undergoes shape-memory behavior that leads large recoverable deformation. Additionally, it also provides biasing stress to the LCEs that should greatly reduce the recovery time of the composite material. The combination of these unique and varied properties will give the composite material a level of customization and tailored behavior that is simply not achievable with any of the constituents independently and will be of interest from both a research perspective and attractive as a marketable product.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase I project will test the feasibility of incorporating a novel vaccine technology to diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine to produce a thermostable and orally administered formulation. Vaccines are one of the best investments in global public health and are estimated to save 2-3 million lives per year and protect more than 100 million lives from illness and disability. This project proposes to use a novel vaccine technology platform that targets immune cells in the intestine, enducing a broad immune response, and retains stability at room temperature. This technology has the potential to minimize dependence on the cold-chain and trained medical professionals to administer the vaccine, which are barriers to full vaccine coverage. Additionally, it has potential to increase uptake of vaccine booster doses for adults, with convenience of self-administration and reduced anxiety with no needles. Finally, successful formulation of an oral DTaP vaccine would open the doors to other antigens to be delivered orally. This technology can significantly improve national health, which is one of the missions of NSF. Additionally, switching vaccines to thermostable, oral delivery form is very cost-effective and will alleviate the burden and cost of cold-chain and professional to administer the vaccines. 

This SBIR Phase I project will test the application of a novel delivery technology to the DTaP vaccine. The highly innovative delivery platform consists of a novel adjuvant, a C-type lectin (CTL) receptor ligand with aluminum hydroxide that targets mucosal immune cells for a strong synergistic boosting of broad immune response, and microencapsulation of the vaccine to resist the strong acidic environment of the stomach. This technology can be incorporated into existing or new vaccines enhancing stability and allowing oral delivery. The first goal of this project includes incorporation of CTL receptor ligand to the DTaP vaccine and applying enteric microencapsulation to the particles to protect the vaccine from low pH. Extensive testing and experiments will be conducted to obtain the optimal formulation of the final oral vaccine. The second goal will be to test and compare the potency of the newly formulated vaccine with a commercially available DTaP vaccine in mice. The final goal will be to test and compare the stability of both vaccines at high temperatures. Successful completion of all objectives will provide a great base for commercial feasibility of the technology. This technology has the potential to be incorporated on any vaccine that can benefit from a thermostable and orally delivery platform.

The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project are its two intended contributions: it will advance computer vision for navigation and it will create unprecedented opportunity and independence for individuals with visual impairment. 253 million people with blindness or visual impairment around the world experience difficulty to independently navigate in new spaces. The lack of independence directly leads to disadvantages in getting education and joining the workforce. This project, NavigAid,  is aimed at creating a breakthrough spatial intelligence aid offered as a mobile application which will solve spatial tasks from locating objects to identifying paths of navigation, and to generating rich descriptions of the surroundings. Solving this problem will unlock an estimated direct economic benefit of $26B  annually for people with visual impairment around the world, by decreasing the need for human assistance. The main technological innovation of this project, Ally Networks, is a novel neural network architecture that can learn more robust representations than existing models are able to. The robust representations prevent the networks from making mistakes and make them more operable and useful in situations that need high reliability. Ally Networks thus represent a potential breakthrough to the field of computer-vision navigation.


This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will introduce a novel spatial intelligence system, NavigAid, to assist individuals with visual impairment in crucial navigation tasks. NavigAid will generate contextually relevant, task-oriented spatial information from smartphone cameras. With NavigAid, users will be able to navigate independently in unfamiliar, complex environments, thus achieving unprecedented mobility. NavigAid will advance assistive technologies by providing unprecedented services, such as locating objects and generating functionally relevant natural language descriptions of complex environments. The core innovation in this project is Ally Networks, a novel neural network architecture that learns robust spatial semantics rather than 2-dimensional representations. This unique multimodal learning strategy is a high-risk endeavour, with broad impact if successful. Large-scale multimodal learning is difficult, and our technique?s success will revolutionize the state of the art: neural network vision will transform from systems that fail in inscrutable ways, to systems that never fail under circumstances in which human vision would not also fail. Key objectives of this project are to 1) develop and validate Ally Networks on benchmarks, 2) develop spatial problem solvers that address the most pressing needs of users with visual impairment, and 3) develop a test suite to evaluate the spatial problem solvers.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things."

"abstractText": "This project, from Vanderbilt University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

Vanderbilt University is investing in building an innovation ecosystem in the Middle Tennessee region. The institution plays a significant role in providing pathways to commercialization for scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics related research and new startup endeavors. In 2016, Vanderbilt opened its Wond'ry, a new innovation center that serves its entire community of faculty, students, and staff across all academic disciplines. The Wond?ry provides a facility to host and implement the NSF I-Corps Sites program. Since its opening, the Wond'ry inspired innovation and entrepreneurial interest on campus. Combined with the I-Corps Site it becomes the primary pipeline to commercialization for many aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs. Implementing the I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt makes a positive difference by advancing on-campus activities related to scouting, recruiting, educating supporting and contributing to the National Innovation Network. The two primary outcomes of the I-Corps at Vanderbilt Program are growing a talented diverse and globally competitive workforce of STEM and Life Scientists that are trained to think entrepreneurially about discovery, and nuturing and supporting multiple, local teams to transition their new innovations and research into the marketplace.

The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt University goals are twofold: 1) to effectively integrate educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students on innovation and entrepreneurship within the traditional STEM and Life science curriculum, and 2) to motivate scientists to engage further in customer discovery as part of their scientific agenda, in the hopes that they will devote their science to addressing and solving problems and real needs in society. The Site at Vanderbilt helps overcome commercialization challenges by incorporating a for-credit course built heavily on the I-Corps curriculum and through the hosting of workshops that provide an introduction to customer discovery and business canvas development. By providing a proven model of success and more cohesive structure, the program ensures that faculty, staff, and students receive the best possible training and are introduced to a vast array of regional and national entrepreneurial resources.

The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt trains participants to 1) create solutions to problems with significant positive impact on communities, 2) focus on research with major economic development opportunities, and 3) develop into globally competitive as STEM entrepreneurs. Society will ultimately benefit via an improvement in quality of life through the solutions created to address real-world issues. Middle Tennessee will benefit by having a cohort of well-trained entrepreneurs who, by completing the I-Corps program, will better understand how to identify a viable commercial opportunity and subsequently oversee its successful operational implementation and launch. This will speed the translation of research into new technologies. The subsequent positive economic impacts will occur via these increases in commercialization activities and the number of useful intellectual property disclosures. Subsequent agreements with commercial partners will then grow the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem and empower STEM-entrepreneurs in larger numbers than ever before, thus increasing self confidence in undertaking entrepreneurial endeavors and thus contributing positively to our nation's overall economic growth and vibrancy."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve electricity access for island communities and enable cost-effective restoration of coastal energy systems following natural disasters. Grid-weak regions and island communities typically have poor access to affordable, resilient, and clean energy solutions compared to their mainland counterparts. The frequency and severity of natural disasters is increasing; resilient and flexible electricity supply systems are more critical than ever, especially for island communities. Making effective recovery decisions addresses the different strategies of preparedness for energy systems and can drastically improve resulting economic and community impacts. This project will enable the efficient transmission of energy to island communities through a new technology, mobile energy storage transmission (MEST). The recent improvements of energy storage technology cost, size, and performance have resulted in technoeconomic feasibility of this innovative technology. Implementation of MEST will both improve long-term energy access for island communities and provide rapidly-deployable, flexible, affordable, and resilient electricity delivery systems for short-term crises. The advent of MEST coincides with the increasing importance of island energy systems; a market earmarked for high-growth over coming decades as sea levels rise, island nations continue to develop, and emphasis is put on development of sustainable energy systems.

This I-Corps project is based on findings which identified a significant challenge in addressing the interdependency between infrastructure systems, in particular, pertaining to the role that energy systems play in the disaster recovery process of other infrastructures and communities. The proposed investigation addresses a missing link between resilience of infrastructure networks and multi-industry impacts to more effectively guide preparedness and recovery decisions. This project will evaluate scenario-specific applications of MEST for island communities; complementing the shortcomings of conventional cabled transmission. While on-shore cabled transmission is an efficient and low-cost mode of transporting electricity, subsea cabled transmission is costly and often results in poor redundancy of electricity supply. This novel transmission model, comprised of commercially available components, uses batteries and conventional freight transportation to move electricity from one market to another; providing service commensurate to a subsea cabled interconnector, but with added flexibility, resilience, and many benefits of traditional grid-level energy storage systems. MEST is founded on established economic theory, energy storage technology, and various market data. Research indicates potential for MEST in both long-term island power provision and short-term disaster relief. The combination of these findings indicates a promising future for impact and commercialization of MEST following this I-Corps project.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project addresses 1) improving the overall cochlear implant (CI) programming process, 2) enabling the assessment of the CI electrode array placement which has been shown to affect hearing outcomes, 3) reducing the subjectivity in CI programming by providing patient-specific objectives and quantitative information, and 4) creating a patient focused procedure by enabling CI users to have a better understanding of factors that affect their outcomes. According to the latest reports from several CI companies, around 37 million could benefit from a CI; the number of candidates among newborns each year alone is estimated around 150,000. This technology will not only individualize and enhance hearing outcomes but it will also increase market penetration, by making the benefits more apparent and programming less of a burden, thereby allowing more people to take advantage of the CI technology. Additionally, overall improved hearing outcomes will reduce isolation faced by older adults with poor hearing outcomes.

This I-Corps project utilizes cutting-edge image processing algorithms that localize crucial inner ear structures as well as cochlear implant (CI) electrodes. The resulting information enables estimation of auditory nerve stimulation patterns which are then used to help guide CI programming where the goal is to determine a set of satisfactory settings that will lead to better hearing outcomes. Currently, the programming process is more of a subjective exercise than a patient-specific procedure that is based on quantitative and objective measurements. Clinical studies conducted with over 200 participating CI recipients have showed that significant improvements in speech discrimination as well as recognition in both noisy and quiet environments were achieved when CIs were programmed using this technology. In addition, over 70% of those participants decided to keep their new mapping. This project will help 1) better understand the features and characteristics of the current cochlear implant market including eligibility, surgery and programming, 2) consider the challenges in overcoming the status quo and changing the current audiological process, and 3) determine a commercially viable business model that will improve both the programming process and the hearing outcomes for CI users.

Self-quantification allows individuals to obtain a deeper understanding of the state of their body, empowering them towards more proactive and precise approaches to optimize their health.  Our innovation provides an approach for low-cost, consumer scale self-quantification. Our technology simultaneously provides the health platform providers a secure, compliant transmission service for self-quantified data.  We have identified four primary customer segments which include 1) professional diagnostic developers, 2) digital and mobile 'self-quantification' health providers which include smartphone health/fitness mobile applications, 3) academic/corporate clinical investigators and 4) epidemiologists.  These customer segments act as distribution channels to the end users who will use the product.  Commercially, our product will penetrate a $46 billion 2020 mobile health market.  Broadly, with widespread use and the expansion of this technology to include the patient de-identified monitoring of a variety of prophylactic, disease and homeostatic biomarkers, current healthcare surveillance programs would be enhanced with geophysical data, improving both disease and wellness tracking.  This would enable the full implementation of predictive analytics, enhancing the way researchers track, monitor and eventually predict wellness and disease worldwide.

This I-Corps project seeks to perform a thorough customer discovery process of 'self-quantification' users and digital health platform providers to identify the most valuable product parameters before formulating our innovation into a market-ready product.  Our innovation provides a seamless platform which empowers consumers to 'self-quantify' by tracking biomarkers at home.  This activity will generate useful data for research studies and predictive/correlative health outcomes. Our turnkey solution enables any mobile health platform with the ability to incorporate smartphone-compatible rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) into its product portfolio while utilizing our software service to securely transmit smartphone-readable diagnostic results to online databases in accordance with government regulations.  This aspect will be an enabling technology for other uses in the expanding mobile health technology ecosystem. Our RDT will use a lateral flow assay sandwich approach utilizing metatype antibodies and gold nanoparticle synthesis. Proprietary smartphone-intelligible patterns will be formed in the presence of urinary biomarkers. The technological implementation of our approach uses gold nanotechnology processes and protocols.  For example, the underlying, fundamental synthesis processes and protocols used to generate core-shell magnetometallic nanoparticles will be utilized in the synthesis of nanozyme nanotechnology which comprises our proposed smartphone-readable rapid diagnostic test.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a novel prosthesis that addresses many health concerns addressed by the more than 600,000 individuals in the lower limb amputee population. The amputee population exhibits many day-to-day challenges associated with mobility tasks such as descending stairs, or even level ground walking. This projects seeks to develop an ankle prosthesis that addresses many of these needs while maintaining a small, quiet, and lightweight package. No other prosthesis on the commercial market exhibits the same functionality as this device, and therefore, there exists a gap in the market that can be filled by this device.

This I-Corps project is based on a novel ankle prosthesis, utilizing a novel actuator. This novel actuator allows this device to exhibit the following three mechanical functions: 1) high torque locking under load; 2) high-power dissipation under load; and 3) low-power generation in the absence of a load. These functions allow amputees to adapt to various terrains, gain support during standing, perform stair descent like healthy subjects as well as lift their toe during swing to avoid tripping. A prototype device has been created, and is to be assessed on amputees to determine its biomechanical benefit.

"abstractText": "Nanoscience is one of the most exciting areas of modern research stretching across the whole spectrum of science including: physics, engineering, chemistry, medicine and health. Computational Nanoscience addresses the challenges of this rapidly evolving field by using novel computational methods to tackle practical problems.

The main objective of this project is to create international research opportunity for students and immerse them in creative computational nanoscience projects. Through the international research experience,  students will become part of a new generation of computational scientists modeling outstanding problems in materials science, physics and chemistry as researchers in industry, academia, and government labs. To achieve this, students will be trained in both theoretical and practical aspects of computational modeling, and further their professional development through participation in computational projects in an international research environment. The international research framework will allow students to be practitioners and innovators in computational modeling by educating them in both fundamentals (mathematics, physics, computational tools, material science and computer science) and applications.  The students will have opportunity to do research in Japan's leading research center (Tsukuba Science City), world renowned National Lab (RIKEN) and best university (University of Tokyo) and will have access to the world's best supercomputers. In addition, the students will be exposed to Japan's multifaceted culture, traditions, history and natural beauty.

The proposed research presents broad training opportunities for students overarching physics, electrical engineering, material science, quantum mechanical simulations, high performance computing, and novel computational algorithms. The proposed international collaboration
will provide an unparalleled research environment for students, exposing them to the forefront of scientific challenges and technological innovations from an international podium. The projects will encourage the participation of underrepresented groups by leveraging the Vanderbilt-Fisk bridge program and by actively recruiting minority students. The students will also be introduced into the
rich culture and history of Japan. The host Japanese groups will also likely to benefit not only from the research outcomes but through the international cultural exchange and experience.

The US students will pursue time-dependent simulations of electron and ion dynamics in nanomaterials using novel atomistic quantum mechanical approaches. These investigations will be frontier applications of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanical calculations to describe interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, electron transport and scattering and physics of ultracold atoms. The results of these simulations will be valuable in evaluating the experiments probing new frontiers of material science.

In collaboration with Japanese research groups, researchers from VU have developed a linear scaling atomistic approach to simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecules, solids, and nanostructures in time-dependent external fields. The approach allows for the simulation of electron and ion dynamics in systems containing thousands of atoms, incorporating the effect of electromagnetic fields by coupling the time-dependent Maxwell and Schrodinger equations. The participating students will use these computer simulations tools to study various systems, including high harmonics generation in solids, interaction of laser pulses and 2D materials, ionization and fragmentation of molecules by circularly polarized light, low energy scattering of electrons and biomolecules, and other interesting cases. The students will also develop and test novel computational approaches to increase the speed and accuracy of quantum simulations.

The beachhead application is in a powder-based additive manufacturing system capable of mid-scale manufacturing that can bridge between prototype-stage and capital-intensive injection molded economy-of-scale manufacturing. Such systems can be located in regional production hubs to accelerate new or highly-customizable products to market. The inclusion of the proposed additives in these systems will expand the range of end-product material properties available, and thereby expand the potential client pool for the same platform. Anticipated flow properties of the material will position it as an accessible additive option for other 3D printing technologies as well as the much larger-market of injection molding processing.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project adapts a processing technology that is yet untapped for this application, to produce a composite thermoplastic additive for polymeric powder feedstock 3D printing. This additive is expected to increase stiffness, strength, and thermal stability of the end product, while reducing weight and providing superior handling characteristics during production relative to existing alternatives. The project is focused on identifying process conditions required to produce a nominally conforming product, followed by testing that characterizes the material and handling properties. Results of these tests will be compared against acceptance standards published by the beachhead additive manufacturing system supplier in preparation for inclusion into 3D printed test components.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution. This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. 

The proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions. Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization and oral film delivery more broadly."

Through multiple pilot deployments on live networks, a prototype version of the company's software tool has found a number of serious errors and vulnerabilities that were missed by existing state-of-the-art auditing techniques and monitoring tools, and was able to perform real-time network-wide verification within as little as one millisecond. When more fully developed under this project, the company's technology will help ensure highly available networking infrastructures. To this end the company will work with Urbana-Champaign Big Broadband (UC2B), a community network expected to provide gigabit fiber-to-the-premise to 2700 under-served residences and 350 community anchor institutions. The company will also work with the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), which is building a collaborative network environment to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation in emerging global networks.

Every aspect of our society, from business, to government, to medicine and the sciences, is now tightly intertwined with the functioning of computer networks such as the Internet. However, modern networks are extremely complex, leading to a rich variety of failure modes and outages. These errors can result in very high costs for businesses, including lost revenue from SLAs, lost customers and contracts, fines for violating regulations such as HIPAA, leaks of sensitive information, and decline in corporate image. To address this challenge, the company is building a system that automatically verifies security and correctness of computer networks in real-time, discovers vulnerabilities, and assists network operators in determining their cause. The technology functions by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network's behavior, and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically determine whether the network contains faults. It can vet networks continuously as the network state evolves, detect transient errors and signal immediate alarms, and scale to large and highly dynamic environments. It is intended to provide immediate practical assistance to network operators."

This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs."

Previously, the company has developed a novel membrane material with considerable economic, environmental, and nutritional impact in industrial process applications. Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will provide the manufacturing industry with an approach to identify and detect cyber-physical attacks within their production environments in real-time. Currently, the manufacturing industry is operating production systems vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may cause produced parts to not meet intended design requirements. Such a deviation from design intent could result in damaged products, loss of customer trust, and potentially injure employees and/or customers. The adoption of the proposed approach will secure manufacturers from cyber-physical attacks and create a strong supply chain. This will allow manufacturers to continue to produce sensitive parts both for the general public and the defense industry, increasing the difficulty of a malicious attack to affect part production. Through successful completion of this program, the I-Corps team will further develop awareness in this area through mentoring graduate students and discussing cyber-physical security with manufacturers across the United States.

This I-Corps project employs both traditional decision analysis and data analysis techniques to identify and detect malicious events within manufacturing systems. This is done through a two-phase approach. First, a cyber-physical vulnerability assessment is completed which highlights areas within the production environment susceptible to malicious attack. Employing decision trees and process mapping, the vulnerability assessment is used to provide a high level overview of the cyber-physical resiliency of a manufacturing facility. Second, the proposed detection approach consists of an air-gapped sensor suite which can be placed on any piece of critical equipment to detect malicious events in real-time. The proposed approach analyzes side-channel measurements independent of the machine such as power consumption, vibration, and sound to identify anomalies within the process. Through performing the vulnerability assessment and implementing the proposed sensor suite, the entire production facility can be secured from malicious cyber-physical attacks intended to reduce part quality and/or sabotage produced parts.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on improving human handling and understanding of information contained in long and complex documents. Drawing upon NSF-funded research in digital libraries which apply information retrieval and artificial intelligence techniques (such as natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning), this project will evaluate whether such technologies (with a particular focus on summarization) can lead to new business opportunities within both the insurance and legal industry. One connection between these industries is the sharing of long, often complex, documents. Integrating summarization methods with information retrieval, and further leveraging text analysis and mining technologies, could aid these businesses in more quickly and efficiently managing such documents. More broadly, the problem of creating a useful summary for a long document is applicable to many businesses, including the publishing industry, where the proposed technology could assist both authors and readers, as well as those involved in discovering, searching, and managing published document collections.

This I-Corps project will address how advanced digital library methods can be improved and applied in commercial settings. An important service to aid with managing and understanding information is summarization. While there has been recent automation of extractive (e.g., selecting a set of the most important sentences from a document) and abstractive (e.g., automatically preparing an abstract as would be done by a human abstracter) summarization methods, as applied to news articles or other short but popular works, only extractive methods have yielded much real success when applied to longer documents. Devising and validating effective techniques for constructing abstractive summaries for long documents is a very difficult problem, which is a key focus of this project's efforts. Further, making those techniques work with complex documents in a variety of domains is a special challenge. Connecting such efforts with big data collections, online cloud systems, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and functional user interfaces, are additional challenges that must be addressed in new settings that are of commercial interest.

"abstractText": "Approximately 95% of all land, sea and air vehicles in the world today rely on petroleum to move passengers and freight both locally and internationally. This transportation fuel mix produces ~25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and is projected to grow in the future with modernization of developing countries. International energy agencies note that if transport is to contribute to CO2 reductions to meet the 2 degree C global average temperature target, use of technologies such as hybrid electric and all electric transportation will have to increase in the future. Thus, advances in transportation technologies are clearly a national and international issue, and require globally-minded engineers and scientists to advance interdisciplinary technologies to develop cleaner regional and global transportation systems. Virginia Tech (VT) proposes to expand upon the Future Electric Transportation Systems ( FETS) IRES partnership with the University of Nottingham (UoN), with a broadened scope and stronger engagement with industry and the UK government to establish the Energy, Environment, and Future Electric Transportation Systems (E-FETS) IRES program. E-FETS cohorts of ~9 per year will investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly fuels and extraction methods; energy-efficient, hybridized power train vehicles and systems; light-weighting of vehicle structures; and the human factors issues that accompany their use and adoption. Among the broader impacts of this IRES program are the promotion of international research collaborations that foster innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric transportation systems into our society as a means to address efficient energy use.  

E-FETS will provide an intensive ten-week research experience to undergraduates and graduate students with five of the University of Nottingham's internationally recognized research groups. These include power electronics, human factors, geo-energy, composites and manufacturing, and aerospace propulsion and advanced diagnostics. The program will consist of two phases. The first phase includes three pre-departure workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at VT to orient students to the experience and the project scope. This pre-departure preparation aims to build the E-FETS student cohort team in preparation for their work individually and together. The second phase consists of 7 weeks at the UoN engaged in concentrated research with UoN faculty mentors and facilities. In addition to supervision from a VT and UoN faculty member, students will work collaboratively as part of a large research team including faculty, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows. To facilitate additional professional development, students will also be matched with an industry mentor who will meet with the student before, during and after their research experience. These mentors will enhance the students? experience with international career exploration, professional development, and networking in their field and industry. Seminars focused on the scope of E-FETS research goals are planned during each phase of the program, providing students with the opportunity to connect their individual research projects with the unified research theme of E-FETS, and present and get feedback on their IRES experience. By engaging industry partners with IRES projects, the E-FETS IRES seeks to leverage industry and UK government to grow the IRES program and develop a basis for sustainability beyond the grant.

Participants will conduct research within one of the leading water engineering units in the world, in some of the finest labs globally, and within extremely complex environments. They will tackle one of three environmental fluid mechanics project areas using field measurements, physical modeling, and numerical methods: 1) Coastal hazard mitigation ecosystem services; 2) Contaminant remediation; and 3) River bed destruction.  Each of these areas connect to ongoing research at the University of Queensland sponsored by major government, nonprofit, and industry agencies.  

As the strain on water resources and ecosystems intensifies, it is becoming increasingly important to educate engineers to be ready to face complex issues related to water monitoring and management that stretch across national boundaries.  The field of water engineering requires a broader educational approach beyond traditional curricula, as today's water engineers face challenging and interdisciplinary issues that combine concepts and methods beyond existing theories and data and instead require a research focus.  In addition to the water engineering research component, this IRES program will make important contributions to water engineering education more broadly, as it will produce research focused on how to enhance the education of water engineers and how and why students develop in these kinds of international research experiences."

The central hypothesis behind this research is that system-level synergies between sensing, mobility, and control functions are critical factors behind achieving these unmatched capabilities of bats. To understand how these system-level synergies arise in nature, participating students will be advised by faculty teams spanning six departments to conduct interdisciplinary research projects centered on one of the following topics: acoustical scene statistics of natural bat habitats, dynamic biosonar sensing, maneuvering flight, neural control, physiological basis of sound emission and reception. All student projects will be based in the Shandong University - Virginia Tech International Laboratory in China.

The educational outcomes of the project will be undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills between biology and engineering that will allow them to interpret biological functions from an engineering perspective and within their respective biological contexts. Furthermore, the IRES trainees will acquire intercultural competencies to work effectively in international teams. The project's scientific outcomes will enable engineers to design better integrated autonomous systems, e.g., self-navigating drones, that will have bat-like capabilities to deal with natural, unconstrained environments, such dense vegetation."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to teach math in after-school or summer enrichment  settings located in under-resourced communities. This project will result in cohorts of trained college student math mentors engaging younger students in the full set of digital learning and mentoring services aimed at mathematics.  This program can be integrated into the activities of existing academic enrichment program, such as those associated with the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs and other private entities. Because the trained mentors are college students employed by the company and often already volunteering for the afterschool programs, there is incentive for such private providers to partner with the PI's team and utilize their services. Increasing standardized test scores by reinforcing classroom learning in out-of-school settings is a value proposition for school districts and schools. Parents also see the importance of their children receiving a full high school diploma, which is predicated on standardized test scores.

This I-Corps project  utilizes a game-based learning platform which uses the format of popular action games to implement math lessons.  The user interface is a three-dimensional first-person environment which can be displayed on a personal computer, mobile device or adapted to a virtual reality system.  Once in play, the scenarios given to the student teach the underlying principles behind math techniques. Gaming scenarios can compile to span full curriculums aligned with standardized tests. The digital experience is then reinforced in physical space by trained math mentors in after-school settings, Phygital Math Play rests on the premise that Physical and Digital gaming experiences can be used as motivational tools to learn mathematics in grades K-12. Just as the relational bonds between gamers is a crucial component of digital games, the mentor-mentee relationship will be developed and cultivated for physical play. An important element for this venture is building a mentoring infrastructure between institutions of higher learning and their surrounding school districts. The project team asserts that there should be no distressed school district within 20 miles of a minority-serving institution. To that end, undergraduate mentors will be trained to help reinforce the math concepts linking physical play and digital application experience to pencil-paper computation.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the historic challenges associated with composite manufacturing, including long cycle times, poor recyclability, labor-intensive manufacturing, and energy-intensive curing processes. Thermoplastic composites have the potential to reduce cycle time, reduce labor requirements, and improve recyclability; however, traditional thermoplastic processes are energy intensive. This Phase 1 SBIR is seeking new, more efficient process heating methods that can be integrated into a continuous composite manufacturing process to improve production speed and reduce operating costs, enabling the growth of composite materials in weight sensitive industries that require high-volume, low-cost structural components, including automotive, unmanned aircraft, wind turbines, and cargo transportation.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical feasibility of ultrasonic heating and induction heating as an alternative to infrared heating in a continuous composite forming process. Process heating constitutes a significant portion of the direct energy consumed by in manufacturing. This is particularly true in the production of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites, where the polymer matrix must be melted as part of the consolidation process. As part of this Phase 1 project, heater modules for induction heating, ultrasonic heating, and infrared heating will be developed and integrated into a bench-scale, continuous composite forming prototype. Composite material will be produced using each heating method and energy consumption will be monitored during the forming process. The composite material produced during testing will be weighed and embodied energy will be calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the mass of the material. The objective of this work is to identify a heating method that can reduce embodied energy by at least 40%, relative to the infrared heating system.

Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software."

NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. 

The WSU Site serves as mechanism for collaboration across campus, acting as a structure for providing experiential learning opportunities for students and faculty. By expanding the connectivity between related programs on and off campus, the Site realizes benefits that transcend the individual efforts and enhance WSU's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem as well as the geographical region around WSU.

The goal of WSU's I-Corps Site is to enhance and broaden access to existing entrepreneurship programs within their experiential entrepreneurship ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, 30 to 40 I-Corps Teams per year are supported, expanding startup generation activities to include an 8-week training and idea development process. Each supported Team produces a draft business model for a university technology or Site-generated business idea. Those Teams emerge ready to pursue funding or partnership opportunities through the Site network and national I-Corps Network. Ultimately, WSU will provide a core blueprint for student/faculty collaborative experiential entrepreneurship training which will provide additional pathways for STEM students to engage with faculty in the business assessment of new technology ideas. Bringing WSU into the I-Corps national network allows Site Leaders to accelerate the positive startup culture velocity achieved in the last few years."

This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.

The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity."

Over 40 billion gallons of wastewater are produced every day by sources such as breweries, juice processors, dairies, and other bottling plants. The company's microbial fuel cell technology is expected to offer significant economic/technical advantages for these companies by reducing their disposal costs, reducing the footprint of treatment facilities, and helping them to adopt a more sustainable process for wastewater treatment.  MFC technology also has potential in the low-cost, highly-efficient treatment of municipal wastewater.

The technical advances made in this project will also be applicable to additional market opportunities in LED lighting and other cutting-edge markets.	

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the deposition of water-based nanoparticle solutions using industrially scalable methods and results in valuable scientific knowledge that is not currently available in the field. Nanoparticle-based antireflective glass coatings have been presented in both the scientific literature and commercial products. However, most coatings suffer from either high deposition costs, or a trade-off between durability and performance. In this project, methods to increase the durability of a low-cost, high-performance nanoparticle that were developed in the Phase I project are scaled to high throughput and low cost fabrication methods. The process/structure/property relationships of this novel coating will be investigated and lead to new scientific knowledge related to the large-scale deployment of nanoparticle based technologies. The coated glass will be subjected to industry standard reliability and durability tests. The expected outcome of this work is the demonstration of this technology at a pilot level with industry collaborators."

From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

"abstractText": "In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the supervision of Professors Mary T. Rodgers of Wayne State University and Peter B. Armentrout of the University of Utah will participate in international collaborative research projects with Dutch counterpartners and institutions to investigate the roles of metal ion interactions in biology, energy and catalysis, and the environment.  The biological, catalytic, and environmentally oriented mass spectrometry and spectroscopic studies they carry out are expected to add to the rapidly growing and evolving research areas that interest a broad community of researchers. Each U.S. cohort will be assigned collaborate on several projects, with each student acting as the lead researcher on a particular project.  Outcomes from this IRES are expected to contribute to the underpinnings of these methodologies and add to their continuing development, while contributing to STEM workforce preparation.

Twice a year for three years, U.S. student cohorts will travel to the Netherlands for month long research visits to participate in cooperative research projects that make use of unique Dutch instrumentation (laser systems and mass spectrometers) and cyber infrastructure at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) facility at the Radboud University Nijmegen.  The FELIX facility in the Netherlands is an international user facility supported by an advanced technical staff as well as faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows associated with the university. Planned experiments are designed to measure directly the infrared spectra of the metal-ligand complexes, thereby providing structural and mechanistic information through the analysis of the observed photodissociation pathways along with concomitant theoretical work. Because the FELIX facility welcomes a wide variety of researchers from around the globe, IRES participants should benefit from an exceptional, early career opportunity to interact with Dutch partners as well as researchers from other institutions and countries.  Theoretical calculations, additional data analysis, and preparation of the results for presentation will continue after the students return to the U.S., culminating in the expected outcome of scientific publications, under the guidance of the U.S. PIs and Dutch mentors.  Pre- and post visit surveys along with a three-year follow-up survey will be administered to assess the success of this IRES program. A website for this U.S.-Netherlands IRES program will make the results of the program available to participants, the broader scientific community, and the public."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve patient outcomes by bringing whole brain imaging directly to the patient for safe, fast, and better tolerated diagnostics. Compared to existing brain imaging technologies, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) helmet brain imager overcomes limitations related to radioactive dose, portability, motion tolerance and cost. The lower dose required by the device permits screening or longitudinal monitoring of patients in various cases, such as brain injury, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, addition and other neurological and mental health disorders. The portable nature allows bedside imaging directly in patient rooms, as well as onsite imaging in military and athletic settings, including immediately after head injuries. The device's motion tolerance helps address hospital inefficiency and extra cost from rescanning patients due to movement artifacts, and the discomfort of remaining still, especially for elderly and injured patients. The low cost and small footprint compared to standard PET/CT systems, results in a device with utility beyond just large medical facilities, as it can be used in smaller rural clinics, sporting/military medical facilities, and in research studies of previously difficult to study brain functions.

This I-Corps Project will help bring the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Helmet brain imager into use by clinics, sporting/ army medical centers, and research institutions. The instrument is a ring of detectors that can be placed around the head of a patient to non-invasively provide information of activity in different brain regions. This device requires only 10-25% of the typical clinical PET radiation dose due to the close proximity of the detectors to the patient's head, and published data show high efficiency and sensitivity of the detectors using industry standard testing. Moreover, the PET Helmet system can be transported to the desired location of imaging scanner, and a current research project involves testing the imager bedside for human patients with traumatic brain injury. The device moves with the head of the patient allowing for motion tolerance as well as upright imaging, and we have demonstrated appropriate task-related brain imaging during an upright walking task in human participants.

This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

"abstractText": "The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is a collaboration of astronomers who will use radio telescopes to detect and study gravitational waves, a  fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Gravitational waves (GW) from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes were recently detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The IPTA collaboration will detect GW from vastly larger and heavier black holes at the cores of merging galaxies, via the precise timing of cosmic clocks called radio pulsars. The astronomers anticipate that low-frequency GW will be detected within the next five years, ushering in a revolution in our understanding of the growth and structure of our Universe. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be fully involved in all aspects of the project. They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's interconnected world.
 
The project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency gravitational waves. The IPTA currently consists of consortia from Australia, Europe, and North America, using a total of seven telescopes. In order to further increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international research experiences. The undergraduate students will be drawn from a range of U.S. institutions, including minority serving institutions and those in rural areas. They will work closely with both a U.S. graduate student also trained in IPTA research and their foreign mentor and students in the host country. The students will be trained in astrophysics, big data analysis, and radio instrumentation, preparing them for a range of careers."

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project supports development of a commercially viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.  Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications. One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3 billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve first time IV access. 

In phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access, and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming intra lumen placement.  The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically relevant 3D real time images.  The data are transmitted to a control unit for processing and then presented to a small form display such as smart phone. Research activity will be focused in developing the egonomically acceptable hand piece that does not interfere with  variable angular approaches to the vein. A critical part of the ongoing research will focus on software design for creating an optimal graphic user interface (GUI). Multiple form factors of the hand piece, the GUI, and visual display will be evaluated by practicing clinicians for final production.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop a low cost and reliable torque sensor for use with automotive and related applications. As the proposed torque sensing method is based on the speed, it can be used with most of the engine/transmission systems.  However, this technique requires modifications to make it suitable for use with electric engines.  This will enhance its applicability over a larger range of vehicle applications.  Automotive manufacturers also need the comparison of input torque at the engine and the torque delivered after the differential to the wheels.  This knowledge further helps in reducing possible losses in torque, and improving the efficiencies. This torque sensing method can meet automobile industry requirements of improved efficiency, low cost, while also providing accurate engine torque measurements. The total available market could include all automotive engines and transmissions in the medium and heavy duty vehicles, off-high way vehicles and others in the transportation sector. The long-term goal of this project is to expand the use of this method in other sectors, where instantaneous torque measurement can help to improve the process efficiency.
 
This I-Corps Project will help to investigate the commercialization potential of low cost torque sensors in different engine/transmission driven applications.  Relying on a virtual torque sensing concept, the proposed method requires minimal additional hardware, which makes it an economically attractive concept for automotive manufacturers.  Currently, automotive engine and transmission manufacturers use estimates for torque values.   The company found that the current engine ECU torque estimation has an accuracy of 5-30%.  Commercially available torque sensors cost $500 to $10000, making them non-viable for commercial transportation vehicles. Overall, the goal of the project is to seamlessly integrate the sensor along with the existing mechanical and electronic systems. This sensing method is being tested in a commercially available test facility.  An improvement in the accuracy of torque sensing can result in improved fuel efficiency, better driving comfort and reduced wear of gears.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address a current void in medical and clinical practices across a broad scope of disciplines (e.g., dentofacial orthopedist, speech language pathologist, sleep medicine specialist, respiratory therapist, orofacial myofunctional therapist) specializing in Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMD) (i.e., sleep apnea, dysphagia, malocclusions, tongue thrusts, articulation). Millions of people worldwide are impacted by some intricate and individualized form of OMD each year. Currently, there is a limited number of oral function diagnostic devices available. Providing a device, PARROT, that will capture real-time natural lingual behavior outside a controlled clinical setting may further one?s understanding of the obscure happenings within the oral cavity. Such information may further advance OMD diagnostic and rehabilitation practices as well as promote the engagement of new research across several medical and clinical fields. Recognizing the growing prevalence of OMD across multiple health related disciplines and the projected growth of a multibillion-dollar medical device manufacturing industry, PARROT may address such a need.

This I-Corps project is purposed toward enhancing one's quality of life by establishing a robust method to view lingual behaviors potentially associated with OMD. The tongue's placement within the oral cavity obstructs and limits accessibility to observe and objectively record natural lingual behaviors (i.e., spatial positioning, placement, movement and performance). Such limitations may dilute biofeedback purposed toward identifying atypical patterns or mechanics potentially causing or promoting an OMD; thereby, impeding the appropriate application to effectively treat the OMD. PARROT is a wireless orofacial myofunctional imaging and pressure mapping appliance that introduces the potential for a systematic approach to objectively evaluate natural lingual behavior (e.g., region specific lingual movement, positional habits, and performance) while allowing an individual to continue routine daily activities and behaviors. To date, a particular proximity sensor has been identified for measuring tongue-palate distance along with contact and motion displacement across the stretch of the tongue in the oral cavity, while a specific pressure mapping matrix will measure intensity of pressure applied by the tongue across the palate and upper dentition. PARROT is currently in an Alpha Prototype state with configuration and optimization of biomaterials continuing prior to Beta Prototype validation.

"abstractText": "This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

"abstractText": "This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf)."

"abstractText": "The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project enables key proof points behind the novel concept of a hand-held medical robot, i.e. use of a medical robot to autonomously perform a task during which neither the robot not the patient is fixed in space. The potential outcome of this project is a comprehensive line of robotic ultrasound transducers that enable a variety of interventional point-of-care robotic applications by enhancing the skills of a multitude of clinicians.  As a result, many technically challenging critical procedures will no longer be restricted to solely highly trained experts. Applications include central vascular access (pediatric and adult), biopsy, regional anesthesiology, precision extraction (e.g. thoracentesis), and precision injections (e.g. orthopedic biologics), creating an addressable market exceeding $2 billion. Benefits of man-machine teaming using hand-held medical robots include faster, simpler procedures that can be performed by a much broader group of clinicians, reduced medical complications and patient discomfort, and improved hospital infrastructure utilization, ultimately benefitting both clinical outcomes and total costs of care. Significant insights and implications for other man-machine teaming applications may also result from this project, with potential for robotic applications well outside of the medical realm. 

The intellectual merit of this project centers on demonstrating the feasibility of first-of-kind hand-held robotic capabilities for autonomous needle placement. This project builds on two existing layers of innovation. First is the ability to use real-time ultrasound data to send a needle precisely to a point in the body. This differs significantly from other imaging modalities that require multiple images from different orientations integrated "off line." Next, this is an autonomous and powered system. Once a user selects a target, the needle path is calculated and the needle is advanced automatically. This project builds the third level of innovation through its research objectives - creating the real-time ability to i) recognize and track the target as an object, and ii) make automatic robotic corrections to maintain that target during user or patient movement or changes in target characteristics. The research involves novel image recognition and tracking technology and very precise novel sensing and control loop technology that interact in real time to maintain targeting accuracy in a dynamic environment. The anticipated technical result is to enable a non-expert clinician to reliably enter a clinically challenging "small" central blood vessel in a pediatric patient model with an introducer needle.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make talent search faster and much more effective. More specifically, it will aim to make it easier to connect open jobs with the talents of job seekers. The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them. This technology will provide a dynamic and granular view of the labor market and improve the quality of information available to decision-makers in industry, education, workforce development, as well as for the study of the future of work.

This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production."

This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost. The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development, the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related optical applications that include microscopy, endoscopy, light machining, and display.
 
Resonant beam scanners provide robust high-speed and high-performance operation that address size, weight, and power (SWAP) consumption limitations in state of the art light LIDAR distance sensors. The key outcome of the SBIR Phase I project was the successful integration of a resonant optomechanical element into an R-LIDAR distance sensor, demonstrating a 125 X 125 pixel field-of-view acquired at a 20 Hz frame rate. The SBIR Phase II project seeks to advance R-LIDAR instrumentation through (1) development of low-SWAP robust scanning elements, (2) techniques and instrumentation that allow for improved signal to noise ratio and high-rate data acquisition from pulsed time-of-flight LIDAR sensors, and (3) increased ranging capability of low-SWAP R-LIDAR instrumentation. Successful completion of these technical objectives will result in a distance sensing technology that will be particularly useful for high-accuracy surveying and inspection applications conducted using small unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), where size and payload constraints are acute."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be a low-cost, high-performance nanofiltration membrane technology for removing oils, pollutants, and organic materials from highly contaminated wastewater. Industrial activity in the U.S. produces more than 25 billion gallons of wastewater every day, much of contaminated with oils, greases, solvents, and other harmful chemical compounds. Existing filtration membranes are easily clogged and damaged by these oily materials, suffering a rapid decline in performance. Safely processing this wastewater by conventional means costs U.S. industrial facilities more than $40B per year. A breakthrough in nanofiltration technology will allow industries across the country - such as food processors, landfills, power plants, and paper mills - to easily and affordably clean their wastewater. 

This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the technology and processes to produce commercial-scale anti-fouling nanofiltration membranes for use with highly contaminated industrial wastewater. The project will combine large-scale manufacturing techniques such as high-precision spray coating with a novel chemistry platform based on zwitterionic copolymers to produce high-performance, low-cost membranes. These polymers exhibit extraordinary resistance to organic fouling as well as pore self-assembly at the nanometer scale. To achieve the required performance, the project will develop the process and materials to achieve a thickness of less than one micron in the selective layer of a thin-film composite. Currently, layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing conditions. This project will overcome these limitations by exploiting the unique self-assembly behavior of zwitterionic copolymers to achieve ultrathin, uniformly porous films in both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms. The project will furthermore demonstrate the chemical robustness of these membranes with accelerated lifecycle testing relevant to industrial conditions. Commercial-scale production of self-assembling polymer membranes will represent a significant breakthrough for materials in this class.

Gas analyses are a mature but still growing multi-billion dollar global market. The proposed product can have significant impact across multiple industries and disciplines, including food processing and safety, environmental monitoring, homeland security, and biomedical diagnostics. It will provide the following important benefits to diverse customers: speed for near-real time gas analysis with high performance, portability and robustness for in-field and on-site uses, low cost to purchase and maintain, ease to use, and versatility for different applications. Additionally, employment of the proposed microsystem in process and quality controls can help improve productivity while saving costs, and autonomously monitoring hazardous gases in vulnerable environments can help protect workers and the public. 

The proposed project will be a proof-of-concept study on a modular microsystem for point-of-use gas analyses. Conventional gas analysis systems are bulky, resource and energy intensive, time consuming, and expensive to purchase, operate, and maintain. Increasing demands for in-field and on-site testing of volatile organic compounds and other gas phase species call for the development of a miniaturized gas analyzer capable of overcoming these major limitations. However, there are significant technical challenges associated with such system integrations and instrument miniaturizations, which traditionally result in significant compromises to the analytical capability/performance. The proposed solution is a modular microsystem integrating multifunctional high-performance microfluidic/sensor chips in a flexible and expandable format that is suitable for mass production and versatile applications. In Phase I, different chips will be fabricated and assembled into a testing system to investigate the technical feasibility of modular design. A commercial prototype will be developed in Phase II. Successful development of the proposed product will provide opportunities to address unmet needs in a variety of markets involving gas analyses.

There is considerable proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and, antimicrobials that do not develop resistance is of significant societal interest. Silver-based antimicrobials are filling this need, and are being used in a variety of medical, consumer and food-related applications. Silver is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against gram positive, gram negative bacteria (including methicillin-and vancomycin resistant bacteria) as well as fungi, viruses, and biofilms. This has led health care, consumer and food industries to use silver antimicrobial products.  The global market for silver-based powder antimicrobial coatings is currently valued at $910 million and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% until 2020. Concerns however, are increasing about the release of silver and the resulting influence on the environment. Development of high potency silver products using the minimum amount of silver can significantly broaden its use. The benefits of this versatile antimicrobial platform include: 1000-fold increased potency, decreased cost, invisibility and compatibility with formulations.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a highly potent silver-based antimicrobial product. Higher potency is due to control of size of ligand-free AgNP (1-3 nm) anchored to the surface of ~30 nm nanozeolite (NZ), and fast release of Ag+ within the zeolite.  The bactericidal activity of AgNP-NZ has been examined with E. coli (gram negative) and antibiotic resistant MRSA (gram positive), with significant improvement. The potency is further enhanced by modifying the NZ support to introduce multiple features: increased antimicrobial activity via NZ ion-exchanged Zn2+, and surface modification of NZ to enhance interactions with bacteria, including penetration within the bacteria. At the conclusion of this SBIR Phase I project, the product will be ready for further commercialization and marketing by (1) demonstrating the scalability of the synthesis procedure so that there is enough supply of product in the product development process; (2) optimizing synthesis procedure of antimicrobial material according to antimicrobial property, including Ag+ and Zn2+ loading and surface modifications; (3) obtaining third party test reports on optimized samples as objective evidence for marketing and (4) studying the toxicity of the product toward mammalian cells to address toxicity concerns.

While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market.

This product is grown in ambient temperatures utilizing a natural calcium carbonate cement formation induced by a urease-producing microorganism. The Phase II project will focus on material testing and further optimization and cost reduction of biocement products, with the intention of demonstrating pilot manufacturing and rapid commercialization via licensee manufacturers. Using biologic products and fermentation procedures developed in the Phase I effort, improvements will be made to scale up manufacturing and reduce cost in the manufacturing process. The commercial potential of this technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if not superiority, with traditional materials.  Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons of carbon emissions.  The societal impacts of this research would include a dramatic reduction in these emissions, as well as a corresponding reduction in industrial by-product waste. This project will enhance the technological understanding for commercial viability and test data including durability and physical performance.
 
Technical objectives for this effort include evaluation of the resulting biocement masonry products through rigorous American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) testing methods, reduction of raw material costs through continued optimization, creation of in-house production capability for the requisite biologic product, and the creation and testing of a manufacturing process suitable for transition to licensees. Main focus areas of the Phase II project include rigorous material testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs, and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated. Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional expected deliverables include the successful commission of in-house pilot scale manufacturing for biocement constituents as a simplified additive to be used by commercial partners and licensees."

There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.

The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to make significant contributions to the future of thermal environmental conditioning in buildings throughout the world.  The connected, low power, wearable personal comfort systems can provide relief for the thermally-underserved of America's workforce (who are disproportionately female or part of the aging population), thereby improving their workplace wellbeing, satisfaction, and productivity. The personal comfort system could increase worker productivity by 2-3%, unlocking $17B economic output that is currently lost due to thermal discomfort in the United States, and could reduce the cost of space heating/cooling buildings by 20-30% when integrated into smart building systems. As roughly 10% of the world's energy is spent heating and cooling the interiors of commercial buildings, this technology can make an impactful contribution to the preservation of our planet and the wellbeing of future generations. 

The proposed project will support the development and demonstration of a connected, low-power wearable personal comfort system that provides personalized thermal comfort to building occupants. Americans spend over 90% of their time indoors, buildings are responsible for about 40% of our total energy consumption, and yet over 40% of people in office buildings are dissatisfied with their thermal environments. The proposed project has the potential to correct this imbalance, improving occupant comfort and productivity while reducing the energy consumed by buildings. In Phase I, we demonstrated a connected, wearable personal comfort system that can improve the perceived environmental temperature by over +/-6 degF using only 1-2 W of power. In order to harness this enormous technological potential, this Phase II R&D will address remaining technical challenges around ergonomics and thermal management, intensively validate the efficacy of the devices in a laboratory setting, and culminate in deploying this technology in smart buildings and quantifying the effect on both the building and the building occupants.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its capability to create a positive impact on current and future wireless systems. Multifunctional reconfigurable antenna (MRA) technology targeted in this project enables a single antenna element to dynamically change its frequency band, radiation pattern and polarization properties, which directly impact the radio-frequency (RF) coverage, capacity, and quality of service achieved by any wireless network. Machine-to-machine communications, Internet of Things applications, satellite communications, radar-based sensing, and tactical military communications are just a few of the areas that will benefit from the results of this work. 

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications. 5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity. Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands, where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage, increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
regulatory clearance and commercialization."

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

"abstractText": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

"abstractText": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.
