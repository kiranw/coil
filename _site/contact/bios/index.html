Now I do the same through my own agency, Finally, for for nonprofits, fortune 500 companies and of course, the Census! I've my career traveling while working, which included sailing around the East Coast and the Caribbean, and living in Puerto Rico during and after hurricane Maria. So, AMA about remote work, where to go for your next vacation and what to pack in a disaster go-bag. Lastly, I believe everything doing is also worth bringing your whole self to. That means that for me, no workday is complete without having a bit of fun and a good laugh and how seriously we're all taking ourselves.

          <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Jamie</strong> and I am a 2019 Civic Digital Fellow. I grew up in Fremont, California and I currently live in Los Angeles, California as a full-time student at the University of Southern California. I am a rising junior majoring in Media Arts and Practice in the School of Cinematic Arts. My interests lie in the intersection of technology, design, and social change — hopefully in the civic tech space. In the future, I hope to use AR and VR as a diplomatic or journalistic tool in creating immersive experiences that encourage empathy through multi-media narratives and informative storytelling. Specifically, I am interested in issues revolving around inequities in education, the Asian American identity, homelessness, and sustainability within the fashion industry. Both on and off campus, I apply my design skills to a plethora of projects from a medication-tracking mobile application under Code the Change to a group microlending system that empowers Kenyan women to build financial independence. During my free time, I enjoy working with any form of visual media from darkroom photography to wheel throwing, running, thrifting, and tending to my plant collection.</p>

          <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Emma Brennan</strong>, I’ll be a Design Fellow for the COIL team this summer. I’m originally from New Jersey, but I’m now based in LA. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon studying design for environments. I’ve previously worked for Alfalfa Studio, a branding and graphic design company, studied at the Basel School of Design, and presented work at a conference for Data &amp; Society. Besides UX design, I’m really excited about different prototyping methods such as 3D printing, and I’m obsessed with woodworking and glassblowing.</p>

          <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Kiran</strong>, a creative technologist and privacy scholar, and a recent graduate of the Master in Design Engineering, a collaborative degree program between Harvard GSD and SEAS. I'm excited to be joining COIL this summer as a Software Engineering Civic Digital Fellow! I'm an East Coast native, originally from Edison, NJ, now living in DC. I've meandered through computer science, architecture, design and law and am exploring questions of how technology and infrastructure mediates our access to civil liberties. As our lives grow increasingly digital, how do we contextualize our shifting cultural and social norms? I also love dogs, cooking, and climbing (though I'm not great at it) and am so thrilled to be working in public service on a team as thoughtful and exciting our ours.</p>
