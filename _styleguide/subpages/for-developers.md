One of the core features of Jekyll is the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language, which has a series of [filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/round/) and [tags](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/iteration/) that allow developers programmatically generate content.

Jekyll and Liquid do quite a bit, but sometimes they aren't enough for a project's specific needs. When the built-in functionality that Jekyll provides isn't enough, it is possible to build or borrow [plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins) to extend Jekyll.
