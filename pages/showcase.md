### A cheaper, easier way to test for malaria

For many in sub-saharan Africa, finding out if a fever is due to Malaria often means trekking long miles to a clinic for a relatively pricey blood test, and anxious hours of waiting before the results come in. But the Urine Malaria Test kit developed by Fyodor Biotechnologies has begun to change all that.

> &ldquo;Without NSF funding, my company wouldn’t have been able to get off the ground. Early on, when we were too young and too risky for venture funding, NSF filled the gap with an SBIR Phase I grant. Now, after our Phase II is completed, we are a viable growth stage company that employs over 30 people and serves clients globally. The best part— our product is having a positive impact on society, giving people access to an ancient art form that was previously too costly and complex to create and install.&rdquo;

Shasqi, a small business funded by the National Science Foundation, is developing a new way to deliver drugs to specific locations within the body to more effectively treat diseases such as cancer. The team, led by physician and chemist Dr. Jose M. Mejia Oneto, has created a targeting system that could enable effective therapy with lower doses of drugs and fewer harmful side effects.  
  
The system works by first injecting a gel at the treatment site. The gel contains chemicals that combine with and activate an injected, attenuated form of a drug, such as a chemotherapeutic, to trigger its cancer-fighting effect only at the tumor or other targeted tissue. The experimental treatment has been successfully tested against tumors in mice, which experienced tumor shrinkage while maintaining healthier weights than mice receiving traditional chemotherapeutic treatments.

### Improving LED brightness and reducing power consumption

> &ldquo;The National Science Foundation was instrumental in getting our company off the ground. We had identified a high-value problem in LEDs that demanded a solution and we identified a unique approach to solving that problem. However, acquiring investor capital for seed stage R&D is very difficult and the investors that do participate in such early financings look to external sources and experts to validate the technology and approach. Our NSF award was, in fact, that source of validation and within two weeks of having received our SBIR Phase I award we closed our Seed round. The NSF is a critical resource for deep-tech startups and we are thankful to have received NSF support throughout Phase I and Phase II.&rdquo;  
>  
> &ldquo;The company started with two founders doing chemistry in a garage, and today the company employs a total of 10 full-time Ph.D. scientists, including the founders, and four part-time Ph.D. scientists. The company is launching its first product by the end of 2017, and this progress would not have been possible without the support of the NSF.&rdquo;

### Rare words uncover strongly-related ideas shared between documents and across languages

Omnity has developed technology to find shared patterns of rare words across documents— rather than through hyperlinks and tagging —in hundreds of millions of documents and across languages, allowing users to find information close in meaning or idea, even when documents do not directly refer to one another.
