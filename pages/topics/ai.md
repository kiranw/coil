This topic focuses on innovations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to intelligence exhibited by machines or software. AI is not a specific technology or technical method — it is instead a field of study aimed at achieving machine-based intelligence. Current AI technologies are targeted at specific problem sets. Artificial general intelligence — machines that can reason like humans — remains a more elusive long-term goal.  

AI has the potential to be enormously societally disruptive, and the consequences of its introduction must be carefully considered. Proposers are encouraged to discuss possible negative effects of the proposed technology and how these may be avoided or mitigated. 

AI proposals may be submitted either to a broad technical subtopic or under the primary application space, examples of which are listed below.

### AI1. AI-Optimized Hardware (e.g., electronic chips)

### AI2. Business Intelligence

### AI3. Computer Vision, Image and Video Processing

### AI4. Decision Management and Optimization (e.g., enterprise platforms, finance)

### AI5. eCommerce

### AI6. Human-Computer Interaction

### AI7. Industrial Systems, including Robotics

### AI8. Language-Based Technologies (e.g., natural language processing, natural language generation, speech recognition, text analytics)

### AI9. Machine Learning Algorithms and Platforms

### AI10. Medical Diagnostics

### AI11. Sales, Advertising, and Marketing

### AI12. Security, Cybersecurity, and Authentication

### AI13. Smart Agriculture

### AI14. Vehicle-Based Systems

### AI15. Virtual Agents and Assistants

### AI16. Other AI Technologies
