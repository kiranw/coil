The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly evolving field that involves the interconnection and interaction of smart objects (objects or devices with embedded sensors, onboard data processing capability, and a means of communication) to provide automated services that would otherwise not be possible. IoT is not a single technology, but rather involves the convergence of sensor, actuator, information, and communication technologies. Emerging IoT implementations will use smaller and more energy-efficient embedded sensor technologies, more sophisticated actuators, enhanced communications, and advanced data analytics to collect and aggregate information and enable intelligent systems that understand context, track and manage complex interactions, and anticipate requirements. Market verticals that are potentially impacted by innovations in this area include connected cities and homes, smart transportation, smart agriculture, industrial IoT, and retail IoT. Proposals are encouraged that address key challenges across the full range of IoT applications involving hardware devices and sensors. Advances focusing on software, cybersecurity, and computing technologies should apply under one of the Information Technologies (IT) subtopics.
