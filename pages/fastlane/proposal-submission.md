## 4. Proposal Submission

### Print Proposal

If you have completed all the above actions you are now ready to submit your proposal. If you want to print out your proposal before moving to the submission and printing section  below, return to the "Proposal Actions" screen and click on the "Print" button. **This will allow you to have a hard copy of what you have entered into FastLane**. (The printed  proposal is not your official proposal). NOTE:  Only the organizationâ€™s AOR (Authorized Organizational Representative) can submit the proposal to NSF.  The AOR is also sometimes referred to as the SPO (Sponsored Project Officer) in the NSF systems.

-If you have SPO Access Rights, you can click the **"Submit SBIR"** or **"Submit STTR"** button and the proposal will be submitted to NSF. You will receive a confirmation email with the new NSF Proposal ID.

-If you **do not** see the "Submit SBIR" or "Submit STTR" button on the "Proposal Action" screen, you do not have the FastLane SPO Access Rights.  **Follow the instructions outlined below.**


### Allow SPO Access

1\. To begin the submission process, return to the Proposal Actions screen; select and highlight the proposal you wish to submit and click on the button **"Allow SPO Access".**

2\. At this point, FastLane may notify you of some warnings and/or errors related to the proposal. **"Errors"** will prevent you from submitting the proposal until they are remedied. You will receive an "error" if modules or required documents are missing that must be included per NSF policy. Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit their proposal early (days, not hours) to ensure adequate time is afforded to troubleshoot any errors that will prevent submission at this stage. FastLane will not accept any proposals after 5:00 pm submitter's time.  Your organization's time zone is set in the registration section of Research.gov.

 FastLane may also give you **"warnings"** that do not prevent proposal submission, but could indicate missing items that are required by the solicitation. Please be sure to review and address these warnings in the context of the specific solicitation requirements.
