# Apply for Phase II

Interested in applying for Phase II funding? Review this information before starting your application.

## The basics

- Only Phase I awardees may apply for Phase II funding.
- The purpose of Phase II is to provide funding to continue the R&D you began in Phase I.
- Phase II awards are funded up to $750,000 for up to 24 months.
- As was the case with your Phase I application, you'll need to submit your Phase II SBIR or STTR proposal through FastLane.
- If you're an STTR Phase I awardee, you can now submit a SBIR Phase II proposal. [More information on switching from STTR to SBIR](http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf14103).
- If your Phase II application is declined, you won't be able to resubmit it.

## Submission dates

Phase II proposals have fixed submission dates roughly eight, 14, or 20 months after the effective date of your Phase I award â€” please check your Phase I award letter to confirm the exact date.

If your award letter **doesn't** include an exact Phase II submission date, contact the NSF Division of Grants and Agreements representative who is named in your award letter; they'll be able to provide you with the proper date. Please note that the Phase II submission window opens 30 days before the proposal due date.

## Administrative and financial capability reviews

- At the start of your Phase I award, review [important information to know](http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/caar/sbirrev.jsp) regarding Phase II SBIR/STTR administrative and financial capability reviews.
- [These videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGhBP1C7iCOmI1p5UtqYCXzmUL9SzSApv) also explain the review processes and how to prepare for them.
