## About
</div>
<div class="usa-width-two-thirds" markdown="1">
Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) is a nimble, startup-like team within the U.S. Census Bureau with a portfolio of projects that are setting a standard for open innovation across government.
<br><br>
COIL's open innovation strategies include ideation workshops, user-centered design, user experience research, technology development sprints, prize competitions, crowdsourcing, and creative partnerships. These initiatives solve major national problems by engaging a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders from the tech, media, and entertainment industries; federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations, advocates, local communities, and more.

## COIL Projects
</div>
<div class="usa-width-two-thirds" markdown="1">
* <strong>The Opportunity Project</strong><br>The Opportunity Project (TOP) is a technology accelerator program that brings together the tech industry, government, and communities, to generate digital products that benefit the public and drive the economy by using federal open data. TOP works through 12-week tech development sprints, facilitated by COIL, to drive new digital solutions that leverage federal, state and local open data to directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been created through TOP, addressing problems like the opioid crisis, disaster response, veterans' employment, and more.
* <strong>Census Accelerate</strong><br>Census Accelerate is an initiative that matches creative talent with organizations serving hard-to-count communities in order to increase 2020 Census response rates. Like The Opportunity Project, Census Accelerate works in user-centered sprints and workshops in which participating companies, organizations, creative professionals, and influencers develop outreach materials for specific hard-to-count populations, such as families with children under the age of 5, mobile millennials, and LGBTQ populations.
* <strong>Big Tech, Media and Entertainment stewardship and relationships for 2020; UCM </strong><br>
* <strong>User-Centered Design Training </strong><br>Census Accelerate is an initiative that matches creative talent with organizations serving hard-to-count communities in order to increase 2020 Census response rates. Like The Opportunity Project, Census Accelerate works in user-centered sprints and workshops in which participating companies, organizations, creative professionals, and influencers develop outreach materials for specific hard-to-count populations, such as families with children under the age of 5, mobile millennials, and LGBTQ populations.
* <strong>Civic Digital Fellows Program (CDF)</strong><br>COIL manages the Census Bureau's participation in The Civic Digital Fellows program (CDF), a first-of-its-kind technology, data science, and design internship program for innovative students and recent grads to solve pressing problems in federal agencies. Student-led nonprofit Coding It Forward places fellows across government to empower computer science, data science, and design students to create social good by breaking down the barriers to entry in social impact spaces.
* <strong>Big Tech Engagements</strong><br>COIL leverages its unique technology industry experience to engage with some of the world's largest platforms on 2020 Census-related issues and data dissemination.
* <strong>User Engagement Research and Workshops</strong><br>COIL's team includes experts in user experience design and engagement. We engage data consumers, and members of the public around responding to our Censuses and surveys through in-person user engagement workshops, ideation activities, and direct user research.
