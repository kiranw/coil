<p class="text-large"><strong>
Census Open Innovation Labs (COIL) is a nimble, startup-like team within the U.S. Census Bureau with a portfolio of projects that are setting a standard for open innovation across government.
</strong></p>
<br>
<p class="text-medium">
COIL leverages the networks, talents, and expertise of companies, organizations, and individuals outside our own walls to deliver on two key objectives:<br>
<ul>
<li class="text-medium">increasing American prosperity by disseminating federal open data, and</li>
<li class="text-medium">increasing response rates for the 2020 Census, particularly among communities considered "hard to count" - those historically yielding low response rates.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="text-medium">
COIL's open innovation strategies include ideation workshops, user-centered design, user experience research, technology development sprints, prize competitions, crowdsourcing, and creative partnerships. These initiatives solve major national problems by engaging a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders from the tech, media, and entertainment industries; federal, state and local government; nonprofit organizations, advocates, local communities, and more.</p>

<h2 class="text-large">The Opportunity Project</h2>
The Opportunity Project (TOP) is a technology accelerator program that brings together the tech industry, government, and communities, to generate digital products that benefit the public and drive the economy by using federal open data. TOP works through 12-week tech development sprints, facilitated by COIL, to drive new digital solutions that leverage federal, state and local open data to directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses and communities at large. To date, 80 products have been created through TOP, addressing problems like the opioid crisis, disaster response, veterans' employment, and more.

<h2 class="text-large">Census Accelerate</h2>
Census Accelerate is an initiative that matches creative talent with organizations serving hard-to-count communities in order to increase 2020 Census response rates. Like The Opportunity Project, Census Accelerate works in user-centered sprints and workshops in which participating companies, organizations, creative professionals, and influencers develop outreach materials for specific hard-to-count populations, such as families with children under the age of 5, mobile millennials, and LGBTQ populations.
