- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration
    of a new high resolution X-ray detector to be utilized (initially) in medical
    diagnosis. The early work by NGS Detectors and collaborators has shown an improvement
    in resolution by a factor of almost 10 over the X-ray detectors in current use.
    The focus of this Phase I project is to now improve both the resolution and efficiency
    of the detector (in order to reduce the x-ray dose received by patients). The
    initial diagnostic application is for mammography, where the improved resolution
    is expected to allow accurate diagnosis of suspicious features in the breast at
    an early stage, while reducing the false diagnoses (both positive and negative)
    that are recognized to be problematic. The detectors have potential application
    in other medical diagnostics situations, such as neonatal and cardiovascular fields,
    where the higher resolution is expected to extend the application of X-ray diagnostics
    well beyond current practice. Applications for industrial nondestructive evaluation
    in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing are also envisaged. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project focuses on the development and demonstration of a new high resolution
    X-ray scintillation detector. The indirect detector utilizes a new polymeric scintillating
    polymer developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories for security applications,
    and incorporates the material into an optical channel plate. The optical channel
    plate contains an ordered array of high quality capillaries (e.g. 10 micron diameter).
    The scintillating polymer absorbs X-rays, and emit photons that are channeled
    to pixels of an optical detector with minimal scattering. A resolution of 10 micron
    has already been demonstrated, an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude
    over both direct and indirect detectors in current use in medical diagnostics.
    The focus of Phase 1 is to complete the detector characterization, with a special
    emphasis on improving the detector efficiency in order to minimize X-ray dose
    rates for patients. The successful completion of Phase I will lead to a Phase
    II that demonstrates that the higher resolution indeed yields higher feature discrimination
    in realistic diagnostic situations.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to design and develop an innovative medical device solution that can potentially save $1.16B to the overall US healthcare system by reducing the procedural time and decreasing the number of catheters and devices used in Peripheral Vascular lnterven6on procedures. Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease affects more than 8 million people in the United States alone. The annual healthcare expenditure spent on treating peripheral arterial disease is $4.37B. Since 2008, US Center for Medicare and Medicaid has been stressing for greater efficiency and lowering costs for Peripheral Vascular Intervention. Commonly performed Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures in the CathLab, to treat PAD, encounter loss of guidewire access. This complication is amplified in the case of difficult to cross stenotic lesions and, in many cases, is frustrating for the physician as they have to spend several hours/procedures trying to regain guidewire access. Guidewire access is the key for a successful procedural outcome. The Project intends to reduce Peripheral Vascular Intervention cost by improving procedural efficiency by eliminating guidewire/catheter exchanges in current practice thereby reducing Cath Lab overhead costs and by reducing procedure time and effort required to acquire a good quality angiographic image. An important ancillary benefit of the innovation is that the radiation exposure to the healthcare providers and the patient can potentially be minimized due to the decreased fluoroscopic activity. The project aims to continue beyond SBIR Phase I to become a commercial product and be the standard of care for Peripheral Vascular Intervention procedures.

    This SBIR Phase I project is for the design and development of a .014-inch guidewire compatible low profile PTA balloon catheter with a proprietary contrast injection mechanism. This product is ideal for performing PTA interventions in difficult anatomical spaces e.g. below-the-knee peripheral vasculature. The proprietary inflation and injection system allows for treatment visualization without needing catheter exchanges or loss of guidewire access. The output of the Project intends to provide focused and sharper visualization along the entire treatment length and allows for judicious usage of radiopaque contrast in contrast sensitive patients. A feasibility prototype of the concept was tested in an animal model with promising results. The SBIR Phase I project is focused on overcoming technical challenges to design and develop the unique device design to maintain a statistically significant rated burst pressure, develop and evaluate device bond joints per ISO standard 10555-1 2013, Sterile Single Use Intravascular catheters, develop the manufacturing process and tools, to integrate the catheter multi functionality. The Project intends to design and fabricate a test fixture to simulate clinical usage of the Innovative device per FDA Class II Guidance Controls for Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Catheters and confirm that the catheter satisfies customer requirements. The Development efforts as part of SBIR Phase I project involve utilization of iterative design process. 3-dimensional design modeling and optimization, creation of a test fixture to simulate clinical usage, iterative prototyping and testing efforts to ensure the desired device specifications are met.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable a safer, more reliable, and more efficient electric power grid. The power grid is critical infrastructure on which all of America's economic sectors depend, and so its reliability and stability is of the utmost importance. The technology being developed is the ideal modeling and simulation platform to analyze and predict grid abnormalities and blackouts due to its unprecedented ability to simulate complex systems accurately. Its physics-based simulation engine can incorporate more detailed models of loads on the grid, thereby allowing system operators to better assess grid state and stability. The proposed technology is also uniquely capable of modeling distributed energy resources at the transmission and distribution scale, an industry need that has been deemed critical to increase the penetration of renewables on the grid. The technology has substantial potential for commercial impact, as there are thousands of transmission, distribution, generation, and consulting organizations that are potential customers. Combined, these factors can help enable a more robust, secure grid that operates with reduced cost and emissions. This Phase I project represents the first step in making this technology a commercial reality.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project represents a significant departure from traditional methods that are used to model the electric power grid. The team's foundational research has already shown that the technology can simulate the U.S. Eastern Interconnection (half of the U.S. transmission grid) from any initial condition to evaluate complex contingencies - capabilities that are not possible with existing tools. The current- and voltage-based formulation used in the model is more flexible than is used in traditional power systems simulation software, enabling more realistic physics- and/or measurement-based models for more accurate simulation results. The Phase I project includes developing a secure and robust cloud platform for the technology that supports parallelized grid analyses, with a full library of component models and an intuitive web-based interface. This will enable system operators, utilities, and consultants to improve their planning studies and operations by enabling more accurate simulations at a higher throughput than is possible with today's software. The work done in Phase I will serve as a foundation for future advancements in power grid modeling and simulation, including integrated transmission and distribution system analysis and statistical analysis to assess the impact of uncertainties on the grid.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility
    of a microfluidic instrument as a clinical tool for measuring a new single-cell
    biophysical biomarker; mass accumulation rate (MAR). Successful completion of
    the proposed project will constitute the foundation of a medical instrument that
    will improve treatment strategies for cancer patients. Assigning the optimal therapy
    for individual patients is particularly important for the treatment of cancer,
    since every individual's cancer is unique. Although genetic profiling of tumor
    cells has been the gold standard for personalized medicine approaches in cancer,
    recent results demonstrate that only a small percentage of patients actually benefit
    from therapies specifically assigned for them. Aside from few cancer types, where
    drastic patient responses can be observed using genetic profiling, most cancer
    patients continue to suffer from ineffective or sub-optimal therapies, which in
    one of the main drivers of the cost of cancer treatment in the US. This stands
    in stark contrast to personalized medicine in infectious diseases, where almost
    all patients are prescribed optimal treatments determined by functional assays
    based on monitoring the proliferation of microbes ex vivo under the influence
    of a panel of drugs. Unfortunately, no proliferation-based test for cancer has
    proven to be sufficiently reliable to be widely adopted for clinical use, mostly
    because unlike bacteria most cancer cells quickly die when removed from the human
    body. This SBIR Phase I project will develop the techniques to measure MAR of
    cancer cells as a metric for drug response. MAR response reflects how individual
    cells change their growth in response to drugs in very short timescales without
    the long-term effects of ex vivo culturing. The research that will be conducted
    in this project will prove the technical feasibility of measuring MAR in a clinical
    setting for a panel of treatment options. Outcomes of this project will directly
    enable clinical studies to be conducted, before ultimately seeking FDA approval
    through clinical trials. \n\nThe focus of this project is a new technology known
    as the serial Suspended Microchannel Resonator (sSMR), which can measure mass
    and mass accumulation rates (MAR) of single cells with extreme precision. This
    SBIR Phase I project will test the technical feasibility of the sSMR platform
    for measuring drug susceptibility of primary tumor samples with a clinically and
    commercially relevant speed, versatility and robustness. The company aims to develop
    sSMR as a platform and introduce MAR as biophysical biomarker guiding clinicians
    in identifying the best therapy options for a specific cancer patient. Therefore,
    the goals of this first phase are critical, as tumor cells in biopsy samples taken
    from patients show differences in heterogeneity, count, and in most cases, lose
    their viability within 24-48 ex vivo. In Phase I, key technologies will be developed
    that will enable a sSMR chip to process samples with various cell types and counts
    at a high throughput and rate. The research activities to address the technical
    challenges for analyzing primary samples will be three-fold. First, while maintaining
    the measurement precision, the flow rate of cells in the chip will be increased
    to prevent primary tumor cells from adhering to channel walls. This is challenging,
    because the precision of measurement is inversely proportional to the time duration
    each cell spends in the chip. Second, an opto-fluidic switching technique will
    be implemented on chips with a new microfluidic T-junction design enabling imaging
    and characterization of particle morphology, and the avoidance of dead cells,
    debris, and doublets to improve assay robustness and throughput. Third, by leveraging
    the microfluidic T-junction and developed imaging capabilities, a microfluidic
    cell enrichment technique will be developed. This feature will allow for a larger
    panel of drug conditions to be tested on tumor biopsies with limited cell counts.
    For validation of these innovations, response of tumor cells taken from 10 multiple
    myeloma patients to a panel of three drugs and their combinations will be measured
    and analyzed.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of an easy-to-apply anti-fouling, liquid- and sludge-repellent coating aimed to reduce the water footprint, required cleaning frequency, and need for aggressive cleaning chemicals to maintain bathroom fixtures. Advanced ecofriendly technologies that enhance cleaning efficiency are highly sought after in janitorial services for large institutions and homeowners alike. Specifically, the household cleaners market size was valued at $5.79 billion in 2016 in United States, of which ~20% is toilet bowl cleaners that aim to remove bacteria and hard-water stains.  From a societal perspective, we estimate that about 6.1 billion gallons of water is flushed down the toilet nationally each day - that is 2.2 trillion gal of water each year in the United States alone. Incorporation of this coating into bathroom fixtures, can significantly reduce the water footprint of bathroom fixtures. Viable low-flow or no-flow toilets may also help help address the open defecation problem affecting over 1 billion people globally.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and investigate a new class of viscoelastic-repellent surface coatings with anti-bacterial and anti-scaling functions for cleaning and sanitation industries. Surface coatings that can resist bacteria and mineral fouling while maintaining both liquid and viscoelastic solid repellency are rare. The proposed project will investigate and quantify the coating design parameters required to significantly prevent the attachment of bacteria and mineral deposits, while remaining durable against mechanical abrasions under realistic operating conditions. This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate that a sprayable surface coating not only can repel both liquids and viscoelastic solids, but can also resist fouling from bacteria and hard water stains without the use of aggressive chemical cleaners or excessive amounts of water. The best coating parameters identified in Phase I project will be considered for pilot tests in Phase II. The development of such a robust, non-fouling coating will offer significant reduction in the use of cleaning chemicals, flush water, and cleaning time, which has the potential to reduce costs associated with sanitation facilities maintenance.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide access to a solar heat source for controlled high temperature applications using minimal, low-cost equipment. The proposed Solar Concentrator Unit (SCU) is the first step to providing individuals and underserved communities with the freedom of a low-cost alternative to many of their most pressing manufacturing and materials processing needs. The SCU produces no emissions in its heat generation, requires no fuel costs, and can be used in remote locations to deliver precision control to high temperature thermal processes. Many new applications become available to market participants through the proposed innovation with the most notable commercial outcome being a multi-material additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) system capable of producing custom metal and glass parts. Additional applications for the SCU include welding; recycling of waste material into useful feedstocks; pyrolysis of waste streams to render them chemically and biologically inert; sanitizing medical equipment in disaster response operations; and very high temperature materials science research by individuals and research institutions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project explores the design and performance of a SCU for delivering high temperatures in the range of 65 ?C to 2,200 ?C over long durations (6+ hours). The technology relies on concentrated solar energy as the primary heat source with the proposed innovation being a feedback control system for maintaining temperature of a receiver plane to within +/-5% of an operating value. The proposed innovation addresses the limitations of existing methods for concentrating solar energy which lack temperature control and whose consistency of output thermal flux varies with time of day, sun position, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. This Phase I project will consist of development of a SCU prototype to conduct characterization tests on output solar flux and flux density under varying solar conditions. The expected outcome of this project will be to prove feasibility of the proposed design concept and evaluate its use for controlled, high temperature applications. The performance characteristics of the SCU will be fully explored in Phase I and the design of the SCU will allow for development of modular Thermal Processing Units in Phase II to interface with the concentrated solar spot produced by the SCU.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of MedSwarm, a software product for radiology that will significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce medical costs. MedSwarm is an AI-based collaborative decision-making system that will significantly amplify diagnostic accuracy across a wide range diagnoses, not by replacing radiologists with AI, but by amplifying their human expertise. MedSwarm employs a technology called Artificial Swarm Intelligence that collects input from small groups of doctors and uses AI to optimize their combined accuracy. This hybrid human-AI system will achieve diagnostic accuracies that significantly outperform (a) individual radiologists using standard techniques, and (b) current state-of-the-art in software-only AI. As a product, the MedSwarm system will be deployed as downloadable software compatible with all existing radiological workstations. Distribution to diagnostic teams will be as easy as opening a web-browser and connecting to a cloud-based server. The market opportunity is best modeled on the Computer Aided Detection (CAD) market, which is projected at $1.9 Billion by 2022. MedSwarm will not compete with current CAD products, as it will provide additional accuracy on all radiology workstations, whether or not other CAD tools are in use.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop, test, and validate MedSwarm, the first commercially viable system for amplifying diagnostic accuracy of radiologists by combining human and machine intelligence. The technology, called Swarm AI, does not replace radiologists with AI, but connects small groups of radiologists together and optimizes their combined insights, enabling accuracy levels that greatly exceed baseline abilities. The company anticipates diagnostic error reductions of at least 30% using the system developed in Phase I, with the majority of the improvement being in the reduction of false-positives. The proposed research requires the development of new software modules, new optimization algorithms, and new interface protocols for enabling radiologists to connect online, view the same images at the same time, and work together as a real-time system to converge on unified diagnoses. Development also requires machine learning optimization across multiple experimental parameters, to reduce the time required for each diagnosis, increasing throughput and reducing costs. The company's goals for Phase I include a proof-of-concept system that (i) significantly outperforms individual radiologists, (ii) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning systems, and (iii) can identify which cases are most appropriate for this system, as compared to alternate methods.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop a delaminated zeolite-based catalyst to facilitate more economical and environmentally friendly propylene-oxide (PO) production.  PO is a commodity chemical with a $5.6B/year market.  The two current pain points for PO producers are (i) that the currently used industrial catalyst lacks long-term stability under the harsh conditions at the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor, and (ii) as a result of catalyst deficiency, that the process to manufacture PO consumes an extra $140M of raw materials per year, separate from the problem in (i) above.  Berkeley Materials Solutions developed a catalyst for the tail-end of the PO synthesis reactor that nearly eliminates both of these problems. The catalyst allows for nearly 100% conversion of all raw material into PO, which leads to $145 M/year of additional revenue for PO producers, corresponding to a revenue increase of 8.6%. This increased revenue comes at no additional cost since it is a drop-in replacement.  In addition, there are significant energy efficiency improvements associated with recovering the currently lost raw material in the PO synthesis process, which amounts to a CO2 footprint of ~740 kilo tons of CO2 per year worldwide.

    The intellectual merit of this project will be represented by the development of a generalizable crystalline catalyst platform to replace existing amorphous catalysts. Technical hurdles that will be addressed in the proposal are (i) the successful delamination of a layered zeolite precursor using a swelling method and sonication, (ii) establishing a sonication-free scalable delamination method for layered zeolite precursors, and (iii) the insertion of catalytically active heteroatom sites into the delaminates frameworks. If successful, this will enable the economical production of these zeolite catalysts for application in the PO synthesis reactor under flow conditions. The targeted scales even during Phase I activities are large enough to enable testing in collaboration with industrial partners who manufacture propylene oxide at large scales. These test results will be used to optimize the prototype catalyst.  The results from Phase I activities will help to uncover other possible opportunities to use delaminated zeolites as highly efficient catalysts for chemical manufacturing.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Machine Learning (ML) driven solution to automate the process of giving qualitative feedback on student reflections. The automated reading of student reflections for quality and content is a new and innovative technology that is currently not available in the market, as all applications in this realm focus on grammar and writing structures. The innovation will understand the specific actions and strategies students are using (many of which are unique to an individual learner), and help students get the support they need to improve in those techniques or try new ones. This process would build learning skills and growth-oriented belief systems in students, both of which lead to significantly improved academic and career outcomes. Fundamentally, the proposed project will help students learn how to learn.


    This SBIR Phase I project will build the first phase of personalized insights for impactful student goal-setting and reflection. The company will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and ML algorithms to 1) parse, process, and analyze reflections written by students, 2) return a score for each reflection based on a research-based rubric, and 3) notify teachers when a student has a low score and needs support. At the end of Phase I, the company will examine whether the prototype functions as intended with 90%+ accuracy, if teachers can integrate the prototype into their classroom practice, and if it shows early promise of improving the quality of student reflections and learning. With a proprietary dataset of 400K+ written student reflections and data points, the company is uniquely positioned to develop and scale this product vision. Phase II research will develop personalized feedback, strategies and suggestions to help students and teachers find the best strategies faster.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the rapid, cost-effective detection of natural gas leakage to improve public safety, mitigate global climate change, and decrease product loss.  Natural gas is the largest provider of power in the United States.  However, more than 80 Tg of leakage occurs at well pads and pipelines during production alone.  Such leakage poses a public health risk, with 1300 significant incidents reported from 1997 ? 2016, resulting in 50 fatalities, 180 injuries, and $2B in costs. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming potential that is 84 times higher than CO2.  In 2015, natural gas leakage accounted for 198 million tons of CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a carbon tax value of more than $2B.  Finally, energy companies want to reduce leakage to avoid product loss, with 80 Tg of methane having a value of $12B.  This project will directly impact the aforementioned areas by improving the efficiencies and costs associated with natural gas leak detection.  With over 2.2 million miles of local utility gas distribution pipelines 1.2 million well pads in the U.S. alone, the commercial prospects for an improved natural gas leak detection system are very promising with expected revenues exceeding $70M.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will involve the development of a comprehensive natural gas leakage detection solution that integrates compact, low-cost sensors with state-of-the-art analytics.  The solution, which can be used in drone-based and handheld monitoring, will enable energy providers to detect natural gas leakage from well pads and pipelines.  In Phase I, technical feasibility will be demonstrated by the development of a lightweight gas sensor based on incoherent, cavity-enhanced spectrometry and a natural gas camera based on filtered infrared imaging. These sensors will be integrated with global positioning system, wind speed/direction, and data analytics platform.  The Phase I solution will be laboratory tested to characterize its analytical performance, before undergoing field testing on controlled natural gas leaks.  In Phase II, the sensor hardware, electronics, and firmware will be refined to meet the stringent size, weight, power, and environmental constraints of drone-based and handheld deployment.  Likewise, the analytics platform will be refined to incorporate the STTR sensors, interpret the infrared camera data, and provide comprehensive leak detection reports.  The Phase II prototypes will be field tested under real-world conditions with a variety of potential customers for both well pad monitoring and pipeline distribution system monitoring.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be safer and more secure IoT platforms that will contribute to the growth of the IoT market. Current security technologies in the IoT arena are either weak or expensive (usually both). The weakness in conventional approaches lies in their impractical goal of finding and fixing all security vulnerabilities. Modern systems have complexity that vastly outstrips the capabilities of any human or verification tool to find all the security vulnerabilities. The only way to somewhat mitigate this weakness is to throw significant resources at the problem, which is very expensive and still yields an imperfect result. The proposed technology developed in this SBIR Phase I project will provide practical and strong security. It gains these important properties by assuming that all systems are riddled with vulnerabilities, so it builds in security by making IoT computing devices that are unsolvable puzzles to attackers. In addition, it doesn't rely on IoT developers to deploy hand-crafted defenses; instead, developers simply build their applications on the proposed platform, and they receive all of its security benefits.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new direction in IoT security. Unlike the world of IoT security today, where developers and tools are attempting to find and fix every last security vulnerability (and always failing), the technology being developed is a hardware-based secure IoT technology that is impractically difficult to penetrate. It achieves this by engaging ensembles of moving target defenses (EMTDs) on the runtime information that attackers need to build their attacks. To overcome EMTDs, attackers must extensively probe the system to acquire the run-time information obscured by moving target defenses. To stop these probes, the technology utilizes a technology called churn to re-key moving target defenses while the system is in operation. Once the churn mechanism is engaged, attackers will have to start their attack over again from scratch. With churn cycles of 50ms (or less), the proposed secure IoT platform becomes impractically difficult to breach, across a broad array of attack classes. The work proposed in this SBIR Phase I project will advance the technology from simulation to a real hardware implementation, which will allow the technology to be deployed into the IoT marketplace.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable economic development aid organizations to plan, implement, measure, and achieve better gender equality and social inclusion outcomes. Gender equality is recognized as an important factor in catalyzing development and lifting communities out of poverty. Empowered women contribute to healthy and productive families, communities, and nations. An important step in doing this is to integrate high quality and timely gender analysis (examination of how differences in gender roles, activities, needs, and opportunities affect men, women, girls and boys in specific contexts), into decision-making and project planning. For both public and private sectors, early, action-oriented gender analysis is vital to tackle improve outcomes. In 2015 - 2016, OECD aid agencies spent, on average, $41.7 billion per year targeting gender equality and women's empowerment. Conservatively estimating that 3-5% of this expenditure is for gender analysis and action planning, that makes a market of $1.3-2.1 billion in the development sector alone. This project can potentially improve outcomes from that development funding.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop and test a web-based application that automates the currently manual process of conducting gender analyses. This addresses a real world challenge faced by aid organizations to effectively integrate gender analyses into planning to inform effective and timely decision-making. Despite being a requirement by many organizations, there are procurement and contract delays, shortage of gender experts, and manual research and data collection.  This project will develop a machine learning model that leverages big data, APIs, and text-mining, driven by an analytic framework created by experts, to automate this process and deliver customized results instantly for a fraction of the cost. Phase I will build, train, and test the model for one sector and select countries. By the end of Phase I, the model will be tested and iterated to meet high quality control standards. Once validated, it will be ready to scale globally across sectors.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to put forth a solution to the critical problem
    of clinical trial enrollment, by improving awareness of clinical trials with physicians
    through technology that matches physician questions to relevant clinical trials
    via an online interactive social decision support platform. Patient enrollment
    is a significant weak link in the development pipeline and a significant pain
    point for organizations that sponsor clinical trials. More than two-thirds of
    trial sites fail to meet enrollment goals for a given trial, and up to 45% of
    study delays are caused by enrollment difficulties. This can result in lost revenues
    up to $1 million/day. Clinical trials are a critical link between scientific discovery
    and changes in clinical practice that advance prevention, treatments, and cures
    for diseases and disability. Increasing awareness of trials among physicians is
    key in increasing clinical trial enrollment, which in turn is essential in advancing
    health care practice as well as patient health and quality of life. While the
    area of cancer is an initial target for improved enrollment, ultimately the proposed
    solution can be applied to other medical specialties and be scaled globally using
    the same platform. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
    project seeks to drive clinical trial accrual by changing how physicians learn
    about clinical trials. The major innovation is combining a credible online social
    platform with powerful natural language processing technology and machine learning
    techniques to deliver customized clinical trial information to physicians in their
    decision-making process. For this Phase I project, the key objectives are: 1)
    To build out a prototype to match clinical trial information to relevant physician
    questions. Natural language processing (NLP) technology will be created to match
    clinical questions to related clinical trials so that physicians learn about clinical
    trials at the time they are seeking information on how to best treat their patients.
    2) To conduct a pilot assessment of clinical trial knowledge pre- and post-use.
    A small subset of users of the social network platform will engage in a comparative
    assessment, pre- and post-exposure to the clinical trial component, to determine
    the technology?s impact on clinical trial knowledge.  Successful completion of
    Phase I will result in a user-friendly platform that matches clinical questions
    to oncologists and relevant, open clinical trials, and will establish the technical
    and commercial feasibility of the proposed concept.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to promote empowerment of millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people by enabling greater independence, supporting increased educational attainment, proliferation of vocational opportunities, and enhancing their overall quality of life. There are currently no commercial solutions for providing BVI users with an assistive technology (AT) solution that allows BVI users to seamlessly access textual and graphical information via a unified system. Towards meeting this greater goal, this Phase I SBIR project addresses key challenges relating to technical feasibility in creating the core algorithms of Midlina and the functional viability proving that BVI users will find practical utility in its application. By providing a much-needed AT solution leveraging touchscreen devices such as smart phones as a platform (which is already owned and used by more than 80% of BVI users), this project has a high probability of user adoption and market acceptance when commercialized. Given that vision loss is expected to double in the next 20 years owing to age-related eye diseases experienced by the rapidly aging population, this project will have significant economic benefits for the State/Federal agencies providing support services to BVI and aging population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show that a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, will allow blind and visually-impaired (BVI) individuals to independently access textual and graphical information from digital media. The key innovation and strength of the proposed solution is in its ability to achieve this convergence of seamless text and graphical information access by integrating with native mobile operating systems (OS) used on smart touchscreen-based devices, the fastest growing computational platforms among BVI users. This project builds on strong theoretical underpinnings derived from 5-years of NSF-sponsored academic research involving hundreds of human testers and represents an excellent translational path towards commercialization. Two objectives will drive this Phase I project: (1) Developing a novel visual-to-multimodal conversion algorithm that is seamlessly integrated with a native mobile operating system, and (2) Establishing technical feasibility and practical usability of a prototype system through rigorous human user testing. A successful outcome of this Phase I project would lead to: (1) development of core algorithms for a novel touchscreen-based information access software, called Midlina, and (2) demonstrate feasibility that Midlina will enable BVI people to independently access both textual and graphical contents from digital media.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to improve manufacturing technology for the purification
    of monoclonal antibodies, which are important therapeutics as well as valuable
    tools in research and diagnostics. Approximately four new antibody drugs are approved
    every year, and while they can have tremendous clinical outcomes and are sometimes
    heralded as \"magic bullets,\" they often come with a significant price tag. This
    puts a strain on patients and insurance companies, limiting the accessibility
    of antibody-based drugs. Furthermore, antibodies are critical research tools that
    enhance the understanding of biology. The technology developed in this research
    project will provide a completely novel method for the purification of antibodies
    from cell culture that will lower cost, increase manufacturing throughput, and
    accelerate the time to market for new therapeutics. Commercially, this technology
    will disrupt the current gold standard - Protein A resin - making antibody purification
    simpler, faster, and cheaper at all scales: research, clinical, and industrial.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop technology
    for improved purification of monoclonal antibodies.  Although upstream production
    of antibodies in cell culture has improved dramatically, downstream purification
    has not kept pace, resulting in a production bottleneck and a major market opportunity.
    The objectives of this SBIR Phase I project are to demonstrate technical and commercial
    feasibility of a new technology that combines affinity with liquid-liquid phase
    separation to separate antibodies from cell culture contaminants. It involves
    an antibody-binding domain fused to a biopolymer with stimulus responsive phase
    behavior. When this fusion protein is added to cell culture harvest, it binds
    the antibody and, after triggering the phase separation with salt, pulls the antibody
    out of solution. The purified antibody can then be eluted from the fusion by lowering
    the pH. This project aims to 1) optimize regeneration conditions so that the fusion
    can be reused, 2) evaluate long-term stability, and 3) validate the technology
    at scale and conduct a head-to-head comparison to the industry gold standard,
    Protein A resin. The goal is to identify storage conditions that provide a long
    shelf life for a product that can be reused 10-100 times without compromising
    antibody yield or purity. The focus of the project is to demonstrate promising
    capabilities of the technology for use in industrially manufactured monoclonal
    antibodies, replacing conventional chromatography steps with a simpler and more
    cost-effective method.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will primarily benefit people with hand amputations. Touch feedback is a critical component of human manipulation, and its loss is most poignant in people with hand amputations. There are currently no prosthetic devices available to amputees that provide control through touch sensory feedback. Without touch feedback, prosthetic users tend to avoid manipulating many objects they otherwise could because they run the risk of destroying them. Consequently, there is a market need for a richly expressive sensory feedback system for upper limb prosthetics. The proposed research will yield a device capable of such feedback with electrotactile stimulation. These outcomes have the potential to restore a significant amount of function to over 10 million people with hand amputations worldwide and improve their quality of life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of a portable, energy-efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the sockets of hand prosthetics to give users useful sensory feedback. The stimulator will integrate with existing prosthetic control systems. It will be built using standard off-the-shelf components, have a form factor small enough to easily fit into a variety of different prosthetic sockets, and operate for at least 12 hours while operating alongside a prosthetic hand and its control system. To improve sensation quality, a sensation controller that enables consistent long-term stimulation will be deployed, reducing the likelihood of device rejection due to discomfort. The expected outcomes of this research are 1) a portable, cost effective and energy efficient electrotactile stimulator that can be easily placed into the socket of a prosthetic user and integrated with their prosthetic hand; and 2) a user study which evaluates the effectiveness of this device deployed with a sensation controller for daily manipulation tasks. The capabilities of the Phase I prototype will be extended in Phase II for delivery of a market-ready sensory feedback system that is compliant with regulatory standards for medical equipment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project comprises the development of a wearable system capable of accurately tracking glaucoma progression via continuous monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world and affects nearly 80 million people worldwide. Using a novel wearable system, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and medical professionals across multiple disciplines can review the IOP trends at visits, monitor high-risk patients in real-time, and program patient-specific threshold alarms that will prevent irreversible blindness caused by glaucoma and related conditions. Through successful product commercialization, the novel wearable blindness prevention system (BPS) is expected to be adopted by approximately 2 million glaucoma patients annually. Users of the device will have continuous access to IOP data trends. Clinicians will be alerted when at-risk patients fail to comply with prescribed daily medicinal treatment (due to excessive IOP levels) and can continuously track the efficacy of prescribed IOP-lowering treatments. Finally, the IOP tracking capability of the system will allow improvements in the quality of care for general clinicians, medical specialists, and clinical researchers and will be a major player in the current move toward data-driven, value care.

    The intellectual merit of this project centers on laboratory feasibility testing of the fundamental concept behind the novel blindness prevention system technology - image-based pressure sensing - on a benchtop 3D-printed glaucoma simulator that is monitored using an alpha prototype of the system.  The research plan includes testing of the feasibility of a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera which fits inside a pair of eyeglass frames, plus processor, optics, and software, as a way to record pressure changes in eye tissue in a benchtop environment. The key objective is to accurately - and with high repeatability - detect unhealthy eye pressure levels in the simulator using an alpha prototype, a-BPS, that communicates with a standard mobile device.  The target research outcome for the a-BPS is to successfully trigger a high-pressure alarm in a repeatable manner whenever eye pressure in the simulator exceeds a clinically-relevant threshold. It is anticipated that the Phase I research results will show successfully operation in 90% or more of the test samples. The output from the Phase I effort will be used as design inputs for a Phase II prototype, which will be wearable and will allow testing on humans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a practical method for ultra-secure global communication using quantum key distribution (QKD). QKD is an established communications protocol which promises unbreakable encryption via the exchange of single photons, the constituent particles of light. Owing in large part to the lack of a practical way to connect users globally, QKD has not yet been widely deployed. This project aims to demonstrate the viability of high-speed, satellite-to-ground QKD using the low-cost CubeSat platform. If successful, this design will dramatically reduce the initial costs to launch a QKD constellation offering worldwide QKD connectivity, thereby greatly expanding the utility of QKD and driving market growth. Early customers will be the US Government and large businesses who are willing to pay a premium for the ultimate in data security. Government use offers clear societal benefit, as several agencies rely on secure global communications to ensure societal well-being. As technology advances, the network may be used to secure the communications of private citizens. The proposed plan will furthermore develop enabling technologies for future space-based quantum science experiments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce designs for a high-speed QKD payload hosted on a CubeSat. The proposed design will take a substantial step forward from the first and only demonstration of satellite-to-ground QKD (Micius, 2017), which relied on technology that is too massive, expensive, and low-throughput for commercial use. Since CubeSats are heavily constrained in size, weight, and power, the major technical challenge will be to miniaturize the payload and reduce its power consumption while simultaneously improving data rates. To address this challenge, the small business will investigate a novel QKD payload concept that pushes the limits of emerging technologies in photonics and microelectromechanical systems. In Phase I, detailed modeling and simulation of candidate payload designs will be used to evaluate the commercial and technical feasibility of the proposed approach, and to select a preliminary design for initial implementation, which will commence in Phase II.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will support the research and development
    of a new medical device designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized
    patients. Deep vein thrombosis occurs when blood clots form in the veins and is
    a common complication in hospital patients that is also a leading cause of preventable
    death in the United States. This project will develop a device that modifies blood
    flow patterns in the legs in a new manner designed to specifically activate genetic
    changes inside the vein that protect against blood clot formation. The goal of
    this project is to generate a new device that it is capable of creating the desired
    blood flow patterns in patients while maintaining a high level of device comfort,
    reliability, and ease of use for clinical staff and patients. In addition to preventing
    death and disability in the hospitalized population of the US, this project will
    move a new device towards commercial production, thereby supporting economic growth,
    job formation, and tax revenue. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project will leverage novel
    molecular and cellular discoveries regarding the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis
    (DVT) to create a more effective device to prevent DVT in immobilized individuals
    who are at high risk for the disease. DVTs form in the sinus behind venous valves,
    where blood flow is reduced during immobility, promoting blood clot formation.
    This site is typically protected against clot formation by a powerful genetic
    program in the endothelial cells that is unique to the valve sinus microenvironment.
    Loss of this genetic expression program results in a prothrombotic environment
    that supports clot formation and DVT. Research has further revealed that the valve
    sinus anti-thrombotic genetic program is activated by a specific pattern of venous
    blood flow at that site that is driven by muscular activity. During prolonged
    periods of immobility, common during hospitalization, loss of this flow profile
    extinguishes the protective endothelial phenotype and supports DVT formation.
    Ultrasound analysis reveals that current mechanical therapy devices marketed to
    prevent DVT do not generate the hemodynamics at the valve that are produced by
    muscular activity due to their methods of action. This project will develop a
    device that generates a protective hemodynamic pattern in the valve sinus of immobile
    patients by actuating blood flow that accurately reproduce muscular activity.
    To accomplish this goal the device design alters the primary physical manipulation
    strategy of other existing devices away from calf and thigh compression and instead
    induces rapid calf expansion to replicate the effect of muscular activity on venous
    blood flow. Vascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that this actuation method
    successfully recapitulates the venous hemodynamics of the active limb required
    to support expression of the protective genetic pathway in the valve sinus. This
    SBIR Phase I project will optimize the device design to create this actuation
    while also improving patient comfort, mitigating common risks, and facilitating
    ease of use by clinical staff. This project will address key risks in advancing
    a medical device into clinical testing and use, thereby enabling the device to
    bridge to a phase of commercial manufacturing and use.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project intends to enhance listening comprehension skills via an innovative interactive learning platform that aligns with Common Core State Standards for listening comprehension and uses best practices in game-based learning. In 2017, 63% of U.S. 4th graders were reading below proficiency. Improving a students' level of listening comprehension in elementary school is the single greatest influence on his or her reading comprehension. Common Core State Standards now include guidelines for listening comprehension starting in kindergarten. However, most listening activities involve teachers reading aloud followed by written assessments that require decoding and encoding. Narrative audio content models fluency and prosody and helps bridge the gap between word recognition and comprehension without relying on decoding and encoding text. There are no other listening platforms designed for elementary schools and therefore there is a tremendous opportunity for this program to have significant commercial success. The project's long-range purpose is to improve listening skills at the time in a child's life when it matters the most. By utilizing compelling audio content that highlights the latest discoveries in science, technology and innovation, this project also meets the National Science Foundation's mission of 'promoting the progress of science'.

    This project will break new ground and modernize the way listening comprehension is taught and assessed with an innovative interactive learning platform that takes traditional elements of game play and applies them to listening comprehension activities (i.e. vocabulary, fluency and comprehension). More specifically, each audio story will have embedded audio cues that lead to audio/visual comprehension questions, games and polls. The platform will include account management, student rostering, student progress monitoring, administrative dashboards and interactive teacher guides for using audio in the classroom. Studies show that both game-based learning and audio content increase motivation in students, however no studies examine the use of both game-based learning and audio together. The research conducted for this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a qualitative design to best understand and describe how classroom teachers and students use and engage with the interactive audio platform. The goal is to conduct interviews with teachers and usability testing with students to ensure that platform features are engaging, feasible, easily integrated and demonstrate potential for intended educational outcomes. Lessons learned from this Phase I award will be applied during Phase II, when a more robust platform will be developed and commercialized.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be functional neuronal cells derived from human adult adipocytes that will have applications in regenerative medicine.  The goal is to develop dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from transdifferentiated human adult adipocytes using a DA cell induction cocktail.  This will have application in cellular therapeutics and research tools for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and other neuronal diseases. In addition, these studies will impact the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine, since this will be the first demonstration that functional neuronal cells, the main building blocks of brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous systems, can be produced from mature fat cells that can be used as cellular therapeutics for several neurological disorders.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop new technology for generation of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from adult adipocytes (fat cells), which will used as a platform to develop cellular therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease (PD), and PD research tools. Recently, using a chemical genetics approach (chemical approach or small molecule approach), engraftable midbrain DA neuronal progenitor cells (DA NPCs) from human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs) have been generated. Additionally, DA neuronal progenitor-like cells also had been produced from de-differentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) that have several advantages over BM-hMSCs such as homogeneity of DFAT cell cultures, ease of isolation and low immunogenicity. The goal of Phase I project is to validate and optimize the DA induction protocol for generation of midbrain DA NPC from DAFT cells. Phase II will focus on clinical grade manufacturing of these DA cells and testing their therapeutic effect in several preclinical animal models of PD. Commercial products emerging from Phase I/II work include cellular therapeutics for PD and research tools for PD.

    The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is represented by the development of a company in a unique field of single crystal growth addressing needs in solid-state lasers. Single crystal growth represents a small and highly specialized, but absolutely essential, area of modern materials technology. Solid-state lasers are commercially vital because they are compact, durable, relatively inexpensive, and field deployable in many technologies. Single crystals are essential components to solid-state lasers and thereby represent significant commercial potential.  This project will enhance the skill set of specialty manufacturers of high quality single crystals for solid-state lasers. It represents an unmet commercial need in short wavelength solid-state lasers and also will expand the technological skill set of single crystal growers. This last point is especially important, as there is a serious lack of skills, technology and infrastructure in solid state laser production in this country, and this makes the US increasingly dependent on offshore suppliers of essential materials. This program will help train the next generation of critical materials manufacturing experts in the US.

    The proposed project intends to address the development of new single crystals called Strontium Beryllium Borate (SBBO). These crystals are an enabling technology for the manufacture of short wavelength solid-state lasers lasing at and below 266 nm. Such lasers have many potential applications but at present there are no materials capable of practical performance at these very short wavelengths. This shortcoming represents a significant commercial opportunity. The project will examine production of single crystals of a new material to meet this need using hydrothermal synthesis, which employs very hot water at high pressures as a growth environment. In this Phase I project, research will be undertaken to develop a growth protocol of large single crystals of this vital material, A feedstock will be perfected, and seed crystals will be produced. Transport conditions will be optimized, and suitable temperature gradients will be identified. Preliminary evaluation of crystal quality will be performed. Suitable crystals will be sent to collaborators in the laser manufacturing industry for preliminary production of solid-state short wavelength lasers. The seed crystals and growth protocols from the research in this Phase I program will be used in a Phase II project for development of a full-scale commercial manufacturing process for this crystal.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to sell affordable backup generators that provide 23 kilowatts, for operating a home's lights and appliances. With power outages due to natural disasters and an aging power grid becoming ever more frequent, and with society increasingly reliant on electricity to power not only lights and household appliances, but also computers, wireless routers, and medical devices, back-up power is an increasingly critical need. This SBIR's portable generator is expected to be more than an order of magnitude lower cubic size and weight, all at a reduced cost compared to existing generators.  The broader impact of this project is its significant benefits to the environment by providing backup power at high fuel efficiency (i.e. less consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels) and low emissions of hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and smoke.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the shortcomings of residential-use backup generators currently on the market. Available backup generators are either small and affordable but can only power a single appliance; or able to power most of a home's needs but cumbersome and expensive. This project will demonstrate the potential for implementing a free-piston internal combustion engine that will maximize fuel efficiency; minimize size; decrease dependence on lubricating oil; and incorporate an engine management system. The objective of the current effort is the engine, while the functioning compact generator will be developed in the next phase. In this free-piston engine design, the two pistons oscillate with forces in balance and reduced side-loads to the pistons, yielding a long-lasting high-speed engine. The pilot work included modification of the cylinder intake ports; addition of a modified squish band and dome to the cylinder head; and use of low-friction bearing materials yielding a successful prototype that runs on regular gasoline. The engineers will continue implementing, testing, and improving on these modifications. The successful completion of this project will yield an efficient, compact, low-weight, and low-emissions generator that produces 23 kilowatts of usable power that runs on standard pump gasoline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from advancing the application territory of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and 4G/5G/Beyond-5G ecosystems. If successful, the obtained results would directly benefit a large portion of the current 8.4 billion wirelessly "connected things" with an estimated $273 billion market. It will facilitate "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network services and further help enable many emerging IoT applications (e.g., safe driving, remote healthcare, smart city, wearables). The technology is expected to create new business opportunities for IoT vendors, service providers, and mobile virtual network operators. If successful, it will facilitate evolution from an operator-centric network ecosystem to a user/application-centric ecosystem.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a software-based solution to enabling dependable, software-defined network services for IoT applications. The objective for Phase I is to provide "always-on, anytime, anywhere" network service for billions of IoT devices and applications. Different from the current infrastructure-based solutions (using software-defined networking or network slicing), the proposed technology offers an in-device, SIM-based software solution without infrastructure upgrades or added device hardware. It enables in-SIM visibility to "black-box" mobile network operations, performs in-device optimizations using readily available mechanisms, and offers further value-added cloud services for network-wide optimization and management via crowdsourcing. The technology is readily deployable on today's IoT devices (both low-end and high-end) and provides "must-have" features for two customer segments (validated through NSF I-Corps interviews) - IoT mobile virtual network operators, and IoT application vendors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a better and safer alternative to conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic instruments that use liquid-coupled transducers for the inspection of pipelines, tanks, and other structures used in power generation and liquid process industries. This new instrument does not require the use of liquid coupling, and can work on rough, coated, or contaminated surfaces that cannot be inspected with conventional liquid-coupled techniques unless the part is subjected to costly and time consuming part preparation. By not using liquids, this instrument can also be used on components that are very hot, very cold, radioactive, or in a vacuum. A high-resolution ultrasonic instrument that does not use couplant and has comparable performance to a piezoelectric instrument will save inspection time, reduce inspection costs, and permit inspections while in-service, which will result in millions of dollars in savings for plant operators. Society as a whole will also benefit from improvements in safety and performance of the plants, and by reducing the amount of waste and contaminants released into the environment as direct sub-product of the inspection, or from failures in facilities and equipment.

    The proposed project consists of the development of a portable, high-resolution, ultrasonic phased array instrumentation, software, and transducers based on non-contact Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) technology to substitute or complement the tens of thousands of conventional piezoelectric instruments in the market. For the instrumentation, the research will revolve around the development of a high-power and compact 16-channel pulser/receiver with a very small dead zone that permit inspection near the surface of the part. This instrumentation will also require custom software with signal-enhancing algorithms that compensate for the small amplitude of EMAT signals. The 16-channel phased-array EMAT transducers will involve multi-physics simulation of electrical and magnetic components to develop very small and high-density coil elements that can produce enough signal amplitude at high-frequencies while handling the pulsing rates required for effective inspection, and the high-power generated by the custom instrumentation. All these components will need to be enclosed in a battery-powered package that can be used in the harsh conditions typically found in field inspections. The expected result is a portable instrument that can compete in performance with conventional piezoelectric instruments, especially in applications and inspection environments where a conventional instrument is not practical or very costly to use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to optimize water utilization, thereby improving agricultural production. It is projected that the human population will exceed 9 billion by 2050.  To meet the expected demand, global food production must increase by more than 50% by 2050. This SBIR project will have impact not only in expanding fundamental knowledge of plant utilization of water but also in contributing to agricultural productivity, an urgent and practical need for human survival, in a sustainable manner.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercialize the advanced water-treatment technology that could enhance plant growth, and therefore improve crop output in agricultural applications. In short, a thin layer (about 100 microns, as thin as a human hair) of interfacial water was found to exist with a slightly higher pH, net negative charge, and a tendency to exclude impurities. These findings were similar to those found by other independent research groups working with xylem cells in plants and muscle cells in animals. Several hydrogels and polymers were also found to contain interfacial water with similar properties. Initial studies regarding the practical use of the interfacial water were conducted in a plant system. On average, initial results show a rapid growth rate of around 10% to 20% improvement compared to the control group; preliminary findings that have now been confirmed to be similar amongst four different plants, namely chick pea, wheatgrass, basil, and pea shoots. This SBIR will enable continued testing and scale up the interfacial water generator to meet water demands for customer validations.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project is to save lives through the proliferation of miniaturized automated external
    defibrillators that attach to smartphones. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) will kill more than 325,000
    Americans this year outside of the hospital. An SCA can cause death if it is not treated in
    minutes. If an AED is available, it can save a person's life; some estimates suggest a 27% increase
    in the number of people who could be saved if AEDs are available and used when needed. A
    miniaturized AED embedded in a smartphone case could save lives by making AEDs more
    available and ensuring those who carry them are reachable by emergency medical services. The
    strategy is to equip law enforcement, firefighters, EMS personnel, and potential citizen first responders
    with this device and use smartphone technology to ensure they are reachable when
    in proximity to someone experiencing an SCA. It provides an opportunity for a new paradigm in
    first response: AED carriers that can be located during the first critical moments of an SCA.
    Through this research, hundreds of thousands of lives can be saved each year.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will prove out the concept of a
    regulatory-compliant miniaturized AED that integrates with a smartphone. The work includes
    researching and designing components and electronics that will enable creation of this critical
    medical device and accomplish three overarching goals: (1) design and develop the miniaturized
    components, interconnects, firmware and software necessary to implement the hand-held AED
    Smartphone case in Phase Two by evaluating high voltage power supply and switching
    electronics and completing a power converter and switching design capable of generating the
    required energy from an on-board lithium-ion battery and supporting a bi-phasic waveform; (2)
    develop the smartphone software and firmware necessary to implement the device itself, guide
    a user through the emergency protocol, and send GPS information to EMS to allow them to
    locate proximal first responders; (3) integrate the hardware and software into a prototype that
    demonstrates a path to a form factor function unit in Phase 2. Research and designs of
    interconnects and encapsulation methods developed as part of this effort will offer insight into
    the miniaturization of myriad electronics both within and outside the medical domains.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the replacement of key petroleum-based chemicals used in the paints and coatings industry, representing a $7B industry that is growing at 7% per year. The total addressable market includes 3 similar diols: 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PDO), and 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HDO). In this project, 1,5-PDO is produced from furfural, a chemical made from renewable agricultural residues such as corn cobs and wood chips.  Bio-based 1,5-PDO can be readily substituted for 1,6-HDO in many applications due to its analogous molecular structure and is similar enough to 1,4-BDO that it can be substituted for it in some applications. Rigorous technoeconomic analysis shows that this "green" 1,5-PDO can be made at 3x lower costs than oil-derived 1,5-PDO, opening new opportunities for its use as a renewable monomer for paints, coatings, adhesives and plastics.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will allow the technology to be developed with commercially available fixed bed pellet catalysts to prepare the technology for scale-up.  Thus far, the technology has been demonstrated in small scale fixed bed reactors with powder catalysts.  A commercial scale process requires the use of pelletized catalysts due to inoperable pressure drops over powder catalysts in commercial-scale reactors. The higher flowrates inherent with larger scale reactors cannot flow through the tightly packed powder catalysts and cause a large degree of backpressure upstream of the catalyst bed; thus, pelletized catalysts must be sourced from commercial vendors and tested for activity and stability prior to scaling.  The next phase in technology development is to scale up the process by >100x, enabling testing and validation of larger amounts of the bio-based 1,5-PDO product in potential customers' product lines.  This SBIR Phase I project will also allow completion of the process design work needed to estimate the economics at commercial scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to the historic challenges associated with composite manufacturing, including long cycle times, poor recyclability, labor-intensive manufacturing, and energy-intensive curing processes. Thermoplastic composites have the potential to reduce cycle time, reduce labor requirements, and improve recyclability; however, traditional thermoplastic processes are energy intensive. This Phase 1 SBIR is seeking new, more efficient process heating methods that can be integrated into a continuous composite manufacturing process to improve production speed and reduce operating costs, enabling the growth of composite materials in weight sensitive industries that require high-volume, low-cost structural components, including automotive, unmanned aircraft, wind turbines, and cargo transportation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the technical feasibility of ultrasonic heating and induction heating as an alternative to infrared heating in a continuous composite forming process. Process heating constitutes a significant portion of the direct energy consumed by in manufacturing. This is particularly true in the production of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites, where the polymer matrix must be melted as part of the consolidation process. As part of this Phase 1 project, heater modules for induction heating, ultrasonic heating, and infrared heating will be developed and integrated into a bench-scale, continuous composite forming prototype. Composite material will be produced using each heating method and energy consumption will be monitored during the forming process. The composite material produced during testing will be weighed and embodied energy will be calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the mass of the material. The objective of this work is to identify a heating method that can reduce embodied energy by at least 40%, relative to the infrared heating system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is a transparent photovoltaic technology that converts near-ultraviolet (NUV) light into point-of-use power for dynamic 'smart' windows. Energy use in buildings represents roughly 40% of total U.S. energy demand. It is projected that over half the buildings that will be in use in 2050 are already built. Retrofitting existing buildings with smart windows that regulate/monitor sunlight transmission could reduce building energy consumption by 10 - 40% and represents a $64B total addressable market, but is presently prohibitively complex and labor intensive. Transparent, NUV solar cells will simplify smart glass/film adoption by obviating the need for external wiring, thereby catalyzing deployment of smart window technologies in existing buildings to increase energy efficiency and enhance occupant health and productivity. Similarly, IoT smart devices/sensors promise to make the built environment more efficient by giving users more control over appliances, information, and energy use. Transparent NUV solar cells can provide point-of-use power to in-window IoT devices/sensors without altering aesthetics. For the photovoltaic community, the operation physics and performance of the NUV photovoltaic technology developed through this program will be of broader interest, as NUV wavelengths are inefficiently harvested by conventional photovoltaics.

    The proposed project will explore a photovoltaic technology that selectively absorbs near-ultraviolet (NUV) light - energy that is otherwise wasted - and efficiently converts it into high-voltage power. Solar cells harvesting NUV photons could satisfy the unmet need of powering smart windows monolithically without competing for visible or near-infrared photons that the windows seek to regulate or imposing design constraints on window aesthetics. First-generation NUV solar cells exhibit power scalability with area, and single-junction photovoltages exceeding 1.6 V (record for thin-film PV). This Phase I project aims to (1) translate NUV solar technology from rigid glass to a flexible substrate, and (2) demonstrate use of low-cost transparent electrode alternatives. These breakthroughs will allow for facile integration of NUV solar cells with smart windows for self-powered operation and intelligent management of the solar spectrum, with NUV photons powering the regulation of visible and near-infrared photons for natural lighting and heating purposes, respectively. Additionally, the aesthetically-discreet nature of flexible, transparent NUV solar cells can enable remotely-powered internet-of-things (IoT) smart devices/sensors. Accordingly, funding for this Phase I project will produce a flexible, transparent NUV solar cell prototype for field-testing with smart window and IoT device technologies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies not only with athletes, but with the 3 million Americans who suffer a traumatic brain injury each year, and the 40+ million more who are concerned about dementia and seek a way to measure their brain health. Current solutions (typically available only at facilities with trained professionals) assess only significant health changes to cognition. In contrast, our solution provides an affordable, reliable way to measure brain health and to monitor changes after treatment, training, and rehabilitation. Thus, it will be an excellent tool other companies can use to assess various interventions aimed at affecting brain function. The "quantified self" market sells technologies (wearables, DNA tests, software) that collect data to inform and guide health and self-improvement. The total addressable global market is estimated at ~$19B for 2019. The initial target market of customers are those seeking a competitive athletic edge by measuring, tracking, and training cognitive abilities such as reaction time, decision-making, and multitasking. These customers are coaches in high schools, colleges, and high-performance gyms across the US.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need to combine and harness the power of eye-, hand-, and head-tracking instruments, virtual reality, and cognitive neuroscience to accurately measure and monitor brain function. This Phase I SBIR project will complete four technical objectives: (1) to develop a highly controlled testing environment that can accurately measure the time users (athletes) spend on detecting, processing, and acting on different cognitive tasks; (2) to develop software that can collect reliable data from naturalistic inputs; (3) to develop a set of tasks that users can complete within 30 minutes and that will generate sufficient data for analysis; and (4) quickly process, summarize, and contextualize the collected data and report meaningful results to the athletes and their trainers. Successful completion of these objectives will realize a first-of-its-kind product that provides meaningful insight into the brain with laboratory-quality cognitive assessment in a real-world context.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project stems from the need to substantially improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency in crop production and thereby improve profitability for farmers, while simultaneously reducing the adverse effects of agriculture on the environment.  Currently, less than half of the N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields is used by the crops to which it is applied.  The remaining N is either leached from the soil or lost to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide - potent greenhouse gas. This inefficient use of N fertilizer by crops is an economic burden for farmers, cause serious water and air quality problems, and contribute about 2.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these N losses represent a tremendous energy inefficiency, because the production of synthetic N fertilizer is the largest energy input in production agriculture. The key to improving N use efficiency in crop production is applying the right amount of N fertilizer in the right place at the right time. The proposed sensor technology would be disruptive to existing agricultural technology and practices, wherein N fertilizer is applied at a uniform rate across agricultural fields, and improve profitability for farmers.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of a robust field-mobile soil nitrate (NO3-) sensor utilizing mid-infrared technology to facilitate precision N fertilizer applications. Mid-infrared spectrometers have historically been large, expensive, and fragile laboratory instruments that require substantial sample preparation, thus preventing their use as mobile optical soil NO3- sensors. The scope of the Phase I research will focus on three objectives: 1) The design and development of a robust and low-cost mid-infrared spectrometer that uses a diamond attenuated total internal reflectance (D-ATR) probe to measure NO3- levels; 2) The design, construction, and testing of a chisel shank-tool bar system that houses the spectrometer and D-ATR probe; and 3) the development of control and data processing and analysis software to manage the system. Anticipated technical results of Phase I will provide a prototype that can measure NO3- in the upper 30 cm of soil, not just at the surface, by enabling modulation of the depth of the shank and the probe as the system is pulled through a field, and self-cleaning of the system as soil is continuously moved across the optical surface of the diamond by the forward motion of the tractor.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project is to empower providers with the unprecedented ability to treat patients
    with chronic inflammatory skin disease effectively and at a lower cost. Today, primary care
    physicians often refer patients with these conditions to dermatologists for the initial diagnosis
    and multiple follow-up appointments, especially when patients are prescribed high cost, high
    touch therapies like biologics or procedures, such as phototherapy. By introducing this
    automated severity scoring system, these providers will have the expertise of dermatologists at
    their fingertips, giving them the ability to assess disease severity and provide systemic
    treatments previously available only through specialists. It will also establish more objective
    assessments, evaluating patient progress to adjust dosage and treatments as necessary. For
    pharmaceutical companies, the ability to have non-specialists make these severity assessments
    during clinical trials reduces expensive and restrictive staffing requirements. Less expensive trials can
    help expedite new drugs to market. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological
    understanding by applying known machine learning techniques in a novel manner to solve a
    difficult visual problem.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will prototype a clinical tool
    that can assess images of a chronic skin inflammation, determine its severity, and suggest
    treatment. This system will be able to guide users with minimal training through the image
    collection process, determine if the information is sufficient, and request additional information if
    required via novel machine learning techniques. Currently, clinicians trying to assess the
    severity of chronic inflammatory skin diseases rely on a series of estimations and manual
    weighted averages, a time consuming and biased process. This Phase I research will explore
    what information is necessary for an algorithm to determine the severity of a psoriasis case. It
    will determine if it is possible for a machine to guide an imager through imaging regions of
    interest at higher detail, rather than the entire body at large. It will also explore how quickly and
    practically such a calculation can be performed. The end goal of the project is a working
    prototype that can consistently score a few psoriasis cases and serve as a proof of concept for
    expansion of the prototype in future work.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a hypo allergenic peanut (HAP) variety,
    which is expected to save human lives by preventing allergy-related deaths, reduce
    the incidence of peanut allergy, and increase security, comfort and peace of mind
    for those individuals sensitive to peanuts and their families, extended families,
    friends, schools, and restaurants.  HAP also may reduce and/or eliminate the number
    of institutional lawsuits resulting from peanut allergy events, and reduce and/or
    eliminate the number of costly food recalls due to peanut contaminations. Reducing
    allergens may gain back the loss endured by the peanut market, improve the U.S.
    competitive edge on the international peanut market, and increase sales by 15%
    to 20% due to an increase market by restaurants, airlines and more. Food allergies
    cost the US $25 billion annually and peanut is a major contributor. HAP will provide
    a significant solution to peanut allergy with the potential to reduce the overall
    cost of food allergy.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project
    is to produce a commercial prototype for a hypoallergenic peanut as a solution
    to the serious health concern nationwide for peanut allergy. In previous work,
    a HAP was developed by concomitant silencing of the genes coding for the three
    most potent peanut allergens Ara h 1, Ara h 2 and Ara h 3. The HAP was 2 to 85-fold
    reduced in allergenic potency, and the HAP trait was transmitted to several successive
    generations in field trials. However, some of the transgenic peanuts were found
    to be chimeric and to produce non-homogeneous population of seeds with variable
    levels of allergenic potency. To solve this problem, repetitive somatic embryogenic
    tissue was used to produce first generation chimera-free HAP (T0 plants). During
    this Phase I project, the progeny T1 plants will be analyzed using Southern blot
    and quantitative PCR to confirm the chimera-free status of the plants. Reverse
    transcriptase quantitative PCR, Western blot, sandwich ELISA and immunoCap assay
    will be performed to confirm the population of the progeny T2 seeds is homogenous
    and has undetectable levels of the targeted allergens. A commercial prototype
    variety for the hypoallergenic peanut will be identified and selected for further
    studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a traveling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) prototype suitable to be marketed to the Quantum Information Processing community. Quantum computers require extremely sensitive amplifiers operating near absolute zero to amplify weak signals. There are two critical features of this amplifier that will benefit the community directly: 1) the ability to have more qubits per amplifier - essential for large scale quantum computers, and 2) the ability to use a commercial manufacturing process. As quantum hardware continues to scale, so does the number of qubits, making multichannel amplifiers essential. European and Asian investment in quantum technology is growing at an alarming rate. The US is at risk of losing the leading position in this technical space. The commercialization of TWPA technology is an example of technologies required for the US to remain competitive in quantum technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a TWPA product prototype for the Quantum Information Processing market by addressing some of the interfacing, packaging and manufacturing limitations of experimental devices. Critical to the ability to distribute these amplifiers to the market is a means of manufacturing such devices at scale. A key advantage of the proposed technology is its ease of fabrication and the fact that it can be fabricated using an industry standard process, which will be demonstrated during the Phase I project.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to dramatically improve Lithium-Ion Battery
    (LIB) technology in order to advance renewable energy penetration and reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions. LIBs are not only a major component of the current consumer electronics
    industry - they are also becoming a key linchpin in the development of clean energy
    applications such as electric vehicles and grid storage. Their limited cost-competitiveness
    relative to fossil fuels, finite energy density, and limited lifetime are all
    still road blocks against mainstream adoption of these emerging applications.
    These issues all point toward a need for significant technical advancements that
    cannot be satisfied by simple economies of scale alone. Coreshell?s innovation
    is to introduce a cheap and scalable electrode coating technology that protects
    batteries against cycling degradation. The technology has the potential to yield
    a marked improvement in battery cost and performance, as well as a reduction in
    manufacturing rates by replacing a slow electrochemical step that can take days
    with a fast coating step that can be completed within minutes. If fully actualized,
    Coreshell?s coatings have the potential to revolutionize the LIB industry and
    enable widespread commercialization of clean energy technologies. \nThis Small
    Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of Coreshell?s unique electrode coating technology. The state-of-the-art electrode
    surface protection in LIBs is formed electrochemically and is termed ?SEI? (Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase).
    SEI is slow and expensive to make, inherently unstable, and consumes lithium thereby
    reducing capacity. This proposal is based on a novel proprietary coating in place
    of SEI, using a roll-to-roll process that can be seamlessly integrated into existing
    LIB manufacturing lines. By depositing well-formed coatings on the surface of
    battery electrodes, Coreshell?s technology can protect against many of the degrading
    reactions that occur during LIB cycling. The proposed technology has the promise
    to deliver greater initial capacity, greater depth-of-charge over equivalent cycle-life,
    reduced manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the potential to reduce LIB cost
    per kWh by up to 25%. In Phase I, Coreshell will demonstrate part of this value
    through two main objectives. The first is to increase initial battery capacity
    by >5% and retain the total capacity to >90% of original after 200 cycles. The
    second is to show that batteries incorporating Coreshell?s coated electrodes can
    eschew SEI formation, which would demonstrate the feasibility of ~7% reduction
    in manufacturing costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
    been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be realized first in household cleaning applications, a market valued in more than 26 billion/year, where currently only about 3% of the market is filled with eco-friendly alternatives. Cleancult new scrubbing system will allow the development of more efficient and potent cleaning products, capable of competing with traditional petroleum-based brands while helping to reduce the water pollution effects due to laundry/cleaning activities, reduce the appearance of skin conditions in customers due to the continuous exposure to harmful chemicals found in traditional cleaning products, and reduce the energetic cost related to the use of hot water in laundry applications. Cleancult objective is to open the door to novel green clean technologies, by first introducing our all-natural scrubbing system in our products and potentially license the technology to other green detergents manufacturers, and later introduce our own all-natural green surfactant molecule, with the solid intention of increasing the green cleaners? participation in the marker by at least 20% in the next 5 years.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide funding for the development of a micellar system(s) composed of a biopolymer particle and a naturally derived from sustainable sources surfactant compound. The conjugation and stabilization mechanism of these micellar systems are the main focus on the research objectives, together with the inclusion of different functionalization to improve oil removal, avoid re-deposition and also enhance the antibacterial properties of the scrubbing system. The complete characterization of the micellar system and its efficacy in removing soil/dirt stains will be achieved through the use of spectroscopic, rheological and hydrodynamic techniques, surface chemistry modifications, and applying the global standards for detergency determination. The research team will work to provide a commercially ready product at the end of this SBIR Phase I project, and due to already in place collaborations with manufacture facilities will avoid delays in the introduction of Cleancults' new line of green powerful cleaners.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is providing a high potent antimicrobial solution for textiles, coatings, polymers, and wound care and bandages. There is considerable proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and, antimicrobials that do not develop resistance is of significant societal interest. Silver-based antimicrobials are filling this need, and are being used in a variety of medical, consumer and food-related applications. Silver is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, effective against gram positive, gram negative bacteria (including methicillin-and vancomycin resistant bacteria) as well as fungi, viruses, and biofilms. This has led health care, consumer and food industries to use silver antimicrobial products.  The global market for silver-based powder antimicrobial coatings is currently valued at $910 million and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.1% until 2020. Concerns however, are increasing about the release of silver and the resulting influence on the environment. Development of high potency silver products using the minimum amount of silver can significantly broaden its use. The benefits of this versatile antimicrobial platform include: 1000-fold increased potency, decreased cost, invisibility and compatibility with formulations.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and test a highly potent silver-based antimicrobial product. Higher potency is due to control of size of ligand-free AgNP (1-3 nm) anchored to the surface of ~30 nm nanozeolite (NZ), and fast release of Ag+ within the zeolite.  The bactericidal activity of AgNP-NZ has been examined with E. coli (gram negative) and antibiotic resistant MRSA (gram positive), with significant improvement. The potency is further enhanced by modifying the NZ support to introduce multiple features: increased antimicrobial activity via NZ ion-exchanged Zn2+, and surface modification of NZ to enhance interactions with bacteria, including penetration within the bacteria. At the conclusion of this SBIR Phase I project, the product will be ready for further commercialization and marketing by (1) demonstrating the scalability of the synthesis procedure so that there is enough supply of product in the product development process; (2) optimizing synthesis procedure of antimicrobial material according to antimicrobial property, including Ag+ and Zn2+ loading and surface modifications; (3) obtaining third party test reports on optimized samples as objective evidence for marketing and (4) studying the toxicity of the product toward mammalian cells to address toxicity concerns.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from addressing video editing as a software problem. All the hurdles that surround this space - the clunkiness of having to poke at a timeline of clips with your fingers on a rectangle of glass, the time and technical skill required to even know how to put those clips together in a pleasing sequence, and the cost to have someone else do it for you - are all problems that can be solved with computational video editing. The cameras in mobile phones are the most important contemporary tool for artistic expression and cultural communication. The company's mobile video editing platform gives young and economically disadvantaged creators (who may only have a mobile device camera) access to the narrative format of video. With the growing adoption of mobile video by creators and viewers in every corner of the globe, high-quality video editing tools are increasingly needed for mobile platforms.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of video understanding techniques that support the creation of artistic and cultural output. This project will develop algorithms, representations, and datasets that allow consumer-grade devices such as smartphones, tablets, and commodity PCs to understand video and generate narrative video sequences. The goal of this Phase I project is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, computer vision, and computational videography. This project will explore rich semantic embedding spaces, end-to-end trained multi-task neural networks, and large-scale data and their application to video manipulation, enhancement, and the ultimate goal of automated film editing.

    software platform that employs a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine
    learning algorithms to process, sort, and analyze human whole genome sequencing
    data from an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cohort from a set genetic background.
    ALS is an incurable, debilitating disease whose genetic causes remain largely
    unknown. Identifying these mutations will enable the development of efficacious
    treatments for the conditions. Three main objectives will be accomplished for
    the platform. One, the ability to process full-size, high coverage human whole
    genome data automatically through the pipeline in a scalable manner. Two, the
    ability to identify the genetic background of a test subject with a top-5 error
    rate of <1%, an important verification step to minimize incorrect cohort stratification
    from false ancestry self-reports. Three, the ability to rapidly identify at least
    one genetic feature known to be associated with ALS (e.g., SOD1, C9ORF72), which
    will help provide early validation for the platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This SBIR Phase I project intends to improve the outcomes of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by providing critical data from non-clinical settings that are currently unavailable to autism treatment providers. The project also focuses on accelerating the analysis of that data. It is estimated that the costs associated with ASD will be more than $2 million over a patient's life. However, studies have shown that the costs of lifetime care for a child diagnosed with ASD can be reduced by 2/3 with early intervention. Designing an appropriate treatment program, and then monitoring its efficacy, requires the collection of a range of data to avoid dependence on inference and anecdotes. Treatment providers often collect detailed data while working with an individual diagnosed with ASD, but they count on parents and caregivers to provide them with data regarding the child's progress outside the clinical setting. The data submitted are usually incomplete and inadequate (if submitted at all). This SBIR Phase I project will result in a prototype that will rapidly provide autism treatment providers with critical data and analysis, reducing the amount of time it takes to design an optimal treatment program, and thereby reducing the long-term costs associated with a diagnosis of ASD.


    This Phase I project will result in a prototype that will make the process of logging data almost frictionless for parents. That narrative data will be combined with video data, biometric data, and additional data collected passively from external sources. All the data will be merged, and then analyzed via machine learning to locate patterns and provide a complete picture to the child's behavior analyst. Developing a camera that will be unobtrusive enough for a child with ASD to tolerate will present a challenge, as will developing the associated software to tag items within the camera's view and save only relevant clips (such as the times immediately before, during and after a meltdown). It will also be challenging to develop a wearable device that a child with ASD will tolerate, along with the associated sensors and software to track metrics associated with arousal and stress. The most significant technical challenge, however, will be to develop the software that combines the multiple data streams and outputs a standardized ABC report (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence) that would be judged as high quality by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the pressing need for providing incarcerated youth and adults with continual systematic and secure personal education and training opportunities, giving inmates the skills they need to productively re-enter society. It will also reduce recidivism rates, and increase their confidence and the potential for contributing to local communities. Every year, more than 700,000 state and federal prisoners are released back into their communities, often with no greater skills than when they went in. The majority of prisoners lack basic high school degrees. The goal of the project is to provide the most effective, secure and flexible offline e-Learning applications for acquiring high school equivalency, the area of greatest need, within the constraints of the prison environment; covering both instructor-led and self-directed learning sessions. At the completion of Phase I, correctional facilities will have an opportunity to utilize a secure, easy-to-administer, offline e-Learning solution for the General Education Development (GED) or for any other education and training in a digital format. A wealth of high-quality instructional programs will be incorporated into the platform that will ultimately lead to a high school equivalency diploma, and additional support to address technical and vocational skills.

    The Phase I project innovation is centered around the delivery of a single, highly-flexible, secure learning management platform, where multiple applications can be stored on a single server. It will provide the General Education Development (GED) content and will be expandable to incorporate additional e-Learning applications including those that can address recidivism. The adaptable learning management platform will automate the provisioning and installation of these GED and non-GED educational applications on private servers, either on-site at the correctional facility or on off-site private server networks. Different sets of content would be automatically customized for each prison, with no outside Internet connectivity required. Another key innovation will be the ability to have the e-Learning system follow the inmate as they are moved. They will always have access to their specific content and progress status as their data will be centrally-hosted on the fully secured prison servers. Their individual records can be confirmed and reviewed for parole evaluations. By providing uniform student analytics and continuous monitoring of learning outcomes with different content and educational application vendors, the system will advance the capability of offline learning to be a data-driven endeavor and will deliver a personalized experience comparable to systems in civilian life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a novel sample preparation method for cryo-EM (cryogenic electron microscopy) studies.  As a rapidly growing technique in the structural biology field, the cryo-EM market as a whole is estimated to be more than $5 billion a year, with > $500 million attributed to the sample preparation space.  In spite of an overall revenue growth rate of more than 70% per year, cryo-EM sample preparation remains an area that has yet to see any major technological breakthroughs commercialized in the past decade.  In fact, the current industry solution is reported to have a failure rate of > 95%.  By providing a sample preparation system that actually works, this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly reshape the massive and rapidly expanding cryo-EM market and allow scientists to more readily collect detailed protein structures in their native state.  This new knowledge on the molecular basis of cells and of life itself will be used to facilitate as well as accelerate the development of new pharmaceuticals as well as therapeutic treatments for diseases and thus greatly benefit human health in the long run.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a cryo-EM sample preparation device built on the application of state-of-the-art microfluidic jet systems to deposit and vitrify protein solution on EM grids in milliseconds, which is at least 1000x faster than the current methods.  Furthermore, it offers scientists the novel ability to control the thickness of the vitrified aqueous layer and, overall, more control over the sample vitrification process.  With this new sample preparation device, a larger region of the cryo-EM grids will have intact protein molecules with the right layer thickness for structural determination, allowing researchers to save time and money in terms of both grid preparation and screening in a high-throughput manner.  Currently, the proposed technology has not been tested nor used anywhere.  Therefore, the first and foremost goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to better understand and well characterize the technical capabilities and limitations of this proposed innovation, with additional R&D work needed before product commercialization, which is expected in five years.  The project will focus on defining and optimizing both the geometric and experimental setup in order to de-risk the technology.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer that occurs in 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans, Hispanics, and those with BRCA1 gene mutation. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. A novel unnatural sugar will be developed for cancer-specific labeling of TNBC through metabolization to insert an artificial receptor onto TNBC and then target the artificial receptor to deliver therapeutic taxanes through a specific reaction between the receptor and the taxanes-drugs. The project involves interdisciplinary combination of knowledge from chemistry, biology, materials engineering, and pharmaceutical science. The successful development of the project will afford an effective targeted therapeutic drug for TNBC patients with improved quality of life in the future.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel cancer targeting technology, Active Tissue Targeting via Anchored ClicK Chemistry (ATTACK), for targeted treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). ATTACK can treat untargetable cancers that do not have established cell surface receptors through cancer-specific artificial receptor insertion of de novo designed unnatural sugars and subsequent azide-Click reaction mediated targeted delivery of therapeutic drugs. Currently, TNBC patients are mainly treated with chemotherapeutics and cannot benefit from existing targeting therapeutics due to the lack of Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or hormone epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2/neu). This project will develop the first cell labeling based targeting technology (ATTACK) for TNBC treatment. Unnatural sialic acid (a type of sugar) precursors with azide will be first used for tumor-specific labeling on cell surface and subsequent targeting. Multiple taxane candidates will be synthesized and preliminary in vitro DMPK properties of the conjugates will be studied including solubility, plasma stability, liver microsome metabolization, and cytotoxic MTT assay. In vivo biodistribution and efficacy of the taxane candidates in combination with unnatural sugar labeling will also be studied in mice tumor models to validate the anti-TNBC efficacy of the drug candidates. The accomplishment of the Phase I research will enable further translational development of the novel cancer-targeting therapeutics into clinical applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over state-of-the-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and be made more efficient by using wide bandgap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include but are not limited to power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel contactless, hybrid current sensor offering an order of magnitude better performance than the state-of-the-art in capturing currents up to and beyond 30 MHz for use in emerging high-frequency power converter applications utilizing wide bandgap semiconductors. The proposed sensor combines complementary magnetoresisor and Rogowski coil technology along with magnetic concentrators into a single chip. By combining these previously underexplored technologies in discrete current sensing would result in a non-invasive, lossless current sensor for MHz converters, where today none exists. Phase I objectives will address technical challenges in developing a chip-scale integrated sensor, including miniaturized Rogowski coil design and magnetic concentrator shape and material evaluation for signal amplification and electromagnetic interference rejection. Design of the analog signal conditioning circuits required for the integrated circuits are also part of this phase.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project involves improving oil and gas sustainability.  To achieve that goal, we are proposing purifying produced water at the wellsite using waste natural gas to reduce disposal costs, carbon footprint and human induced seismicity from disposal wells. This process is enabled by patented equipment that fundamentally changes thermal distillation by performing the entire process inside a heat exchanger to reduce equipment and energy costs.   In Texas, using the amount of gas that is flared annually, the proposed X-VAPTM system can theoretically purify a significant percentage of U.S. produced water problem of 33 billion barrels in 2020.  The brine discharge from the purification process will be concentrated into specific densities to be recycled as a drilling fluid.  This new circular economy will provide environmental benefits by reducing the need for large diesel water trucks to move the source water, dispose the produced water and deliver heavy brine for drilling.  Society will benefit with a new renewable source of fresh water and reduce the need for oil and gas producers to compete with farmers and ranchers for increasingly scarce fresh water resources.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to prove the X-VAPTM thermal distillation system can fundamentally improve thermal distillation by reducing equipment costs and energy requirements.  Before this patented invention, the entire thermal distillation including the distillation and separation from contaminates has never been performed inside a heat exchanger. The unique design provides a removable spring water tray and distillation column to address maintenance issues including scaling in the field.  Our team of industry-experienced engineers will further test, improve and validate the existing thermal distillation prototype by performing prototype lab experiments and coordinated simulations to calibrate and improve equipment designs (Phase I).  These novel simulations will need to be calibrated against coordinated prototype laboratory tests to achieve a 90% agreement between simulations and laboratory tests.  This testing data and correlated simulations will be utilized to scale the prototype design to efficiently handle large volumes of produced water typically encountered at oil and gas well sites.  The proposed research and simulation testing will validate the patented system and create a proposed program for customer field testing prior to commercialization (Phase II).

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to engineer resistance to two bacterial diseases
    in citrus trees, Huanglongbing (HLB) and citrus canker.  HLB and canker have cost
    growers billions of dollars in destroyed trees and are decimating the Florida
    citrus industry. In Florida, annual citrus production has fallen from 242 million
    boxes in the 2003-2004 growing season to 45 million boxes in 2017-2018.  Further,
    citrus canker may be found in 98% of the citrus production regions in Florida.
    Working with the University of Florida, the goal of this project is to use CRISPR/Cas9
    gene editing to advance natural selection to make citrus trees resistant to both
    HLB and citrus canker. If successful, this approach could be used to protect the
    93 million tons of citrus production worldwide. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this SBIR project is to develop HLB and canker-resistant citrus varieties by using
    gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Florida citrus growers need a solution to these
    diseases, and producing a genetically-resistant citrus variety is a promising
    strategy. The approach is to modify plant genes that are the targets of proteins
    secreted by the disease-causing bacteria. The first objective is to conduct the
    gene editing in commercially viable citrus varieties. This will be accomplished
    non-transgenically by transforming a non-integrated plasmid or purified Cas9 protein
    and in vitro transcribed sgRNA in citrus protoplasts. To identify gene edits,
    protoplasts will be grown into callus, which will be screened by PCR and DNA heteroduplex
    digestion as well as Sanger and/or high-throughput sequencing. The second objective
    will be to take plants with confirmed edits, clonally propagate them, and conduct
    preliminary testing for HLB or canker resistance. Plants will be inoculated with
    the disease-causing bacteria and then monitored for disease progression by observation
    of physical characteristics and measurement of bacterial titers by PCR. The best

    greenhouse and field testing during SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology that will enable robust, contamination-free,
    continuous biomanufacturing.  While biomanufacturing may be one of the most technologically
    complex and profitable industries, the underlying production process, batch fermentation,
    has not changed in decades. In theory, continuous fermentation would decrease
    operational cost and increase production capacity.  However, owing to the high
    risk of contamination, continuous fermentation is considered unreliable and is
    rarely used. The proposed technology solves this issue and enables contamination-free,
    continuous fermentation. Successful implementation of continuous fermentation
    facilitates automated production and paves the way for future technological development
    in continuous product purification and recovery. The reduced operational cost
    is essential for the economic viability of bio-based commodity chemicals such
    as bioplastics, as their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness
    with petroleum-derived counterparts. The proposed technology also eliminates the
    use of antibiotics in fermentation, which in turn alleviates antibiotic misuse
    and promotes a positive environmental and health impact. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to explore the feasibility of using a biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to prevent and treat microbial contamination during continuous biomanufacturing.
    Microbial contamination in biomanufacturing processes is a major concern, as it
    results in loss of productivity, time, and money.  In addition, it restricts the
    production mode to slow batch fermentation, and prohibits the implementation of
    continuous fermentation. The proposed technology solves the contamination problem,
    as a biocide will inhibit the invading microbial and viral contaminants and a
    biocide-resistant enzyme will protect the processing hosts. The proposed Phase
    I research will address the technical challenges by using classical molecular
    biology and synthetic biology techniques. The first objective is to demonstrate
    that the proposed technology will provide biocide resistance to bioplastics-producing
    organisms while inhibiting the outgrowth of contaminants. The second objective
    is to show that the proposed technology can be used to prevent and treat contamination
    in continuous fermenters. The final objective is to fine-tune the biocide/biocide-resistant
    system to demonstrate the technology will not adversely affect the production
    yield and product quality in continuous fermenters. If successful, future Phase
    II development will be conducted in pilot and industrial-scale reactors to further
    optimize the technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    will enable widespread applications such as: advanced batteries with lower cost,
    weight, and improved longevity, tires with longer lifetimes and increased fuel
    efficiency, and coatings enabling enhanced functionality such as in the case of
    de-icing for aircrafts, spacecraft vehicles, and drones.  The societal impact
    of this advancement includes better performing and more energy efficient devices
    for consumers without added cost.  The commercial impact of this technology will
    enable the significant effort carried out in many market sectors to evaluate and
    understand the benefit of carbon nanotubes to products, to be economically realized.
    \   \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
    develop a novel electrochemical liquid-phase growth method for carbon nanotube
    production, which significantly lowers the cost of production for carbon nanotubes
    and enables widespread commercial use of the materials.  The largest bottleneck
    to carbon nanotube utilization today is the high production cost that arises due
    to numerous factors including low efficiency of chemical processes, high overhead
    cost for scaling, and formation of toxic by-products that require additional costs.
    \ These limitations have led to high prices for the materials that prohibit their
    use in cost-sensitive markets, which rely on low-cost additives such as carbon
    black.  The research objectives of this SBIR project will demonstrate feasibility
    of using a scalable catalyst preparation and deposition technique for the production
    of carbon nanotubes through low-cost, environmentally-beneficial electrochemical
    routes.  To achieve this, we will utilize ambient processing for catalyst preparation
    and a scalable electrochemical reaction chamber that harnesses the precision of
    electrochemistry, sources the carbon feedstock directly from air, and operates
    at extremely high energy efficiencies (>90%).  The anticipated technical results
    include a rapid and scalable growth technique with minimized added cost from catalyst
    deposition without compromising carbon nanotube quality.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will build technology to reduce the time
    needed to identify effective antibiotics for urinary tract infections (UTIs) from
    2 days to 2 hours. Every year in the US, 13 million UTIs are treated with a physician's
    best guess antibiotic, because antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is too
    slow. Up to half of first guesses are wrong, opening up the possibility for infections
    to worsen into life-threatening sepsis and allowing antimicrobial resistance to
    evolve. One quarter of 1.5 million sepsis cases and at least 250,000 deaths every
    year begin as UTIs. Rapid AST using biophysical sensing can take guesswork out
    of UTI treatment, save lives, and avoid billions in unnecessary healthcare costs.
    By sensing bacterial cell fluctuations associated with the mechanically active
    processes of metabolism, motility, and growth, this novel and fundamentally different
    measurement concept for AST enables almost an order of magnitude increase in speed.
    This project will establish technical and commercial feasibility of developing
    the underlying sensor technology for point-of-care diagnostics that demand push-button
    technology operable in a hectic clinical environment. Translating innovative federally-funded
    technologies like this out of the laboratory and into medical clinics will build
    taxpayers' return on basic research investments. \n\nThis project tackles a key
    technical hurdle for clinical implementation of rapid biophysical AST at a meaningful
    scale: demonstration that the demanding performance characteristics of the underlying
    resonating quartz sensor technology can be reproduced using low cost materials
    for a disposable resonator housing providing fluidic, thermal, and electrical
    control.  The rapid biophysical AST method takes the pulse of bacterial cells.
    Changes in mechanical fluctuations of cells occur after exposure to an effective
    antibiotic, and can be sensed in real time by detecting phase noise generated
    by cells on a resonating crystal substrate. Key to the commercial success of this
    technology are multichannel resonators that can be manufactured in large quantities
    to perform with very low noise resonance characteristics. Best practices from
    low cost microfluidics studies will dovetail with those from high-tech resonator
    development to deliver the phase noise performance needed to pick up the biological
    signal. Rapid prototyping tools including 3D printing will be used for quick design
    iterations. If satisfactory, Phase II will optimize fabrication methodologies
    for both resonators and housing modules interfacing with a fully integrated clinical
    prototype instrument ready to support clinical trials of the technology.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Transfer (STTR) project is the reduction of significant disease flare-ups in patients
    with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), increase in patient quality-of-life,
    and a reduction of expensive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Current at-home
    care support for COPD patients is often completely missing or consists of action
    plans that fail to provide effective, individualized care. The alternative solution
    under development in this project is an easy-to use, personalized mobile application
    that catches disease degeneration early, tracks patient health history, and provides
    decision support to guide patients to the right medical care at the right time.
    COPD is one of the leading chronic conditions driving potentially avoidable hospital
    admissions. Pairing a mobile health management app with a smart triage system
    that provides instant healthcare guidance has the potential to dramatically reduce
    unnecessary COPD hospitalization and provide long-term maintenance treatment of
    COPD symptoms. Moreover, an easily accessible, highly accurate, convenient solution
    can empower patients to make better health decisions early. \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to demonstrate positive impact and adoption of a mobile triage
    application for COPD patients. To date, a set of triage algorithms has been built
    and validated on simulated patient cases. The algorithms exhibited performance
    that is comparable to or better than a panel of board-certified pulmonologists.
    The next vital step is to establish the technical feasibility of a packaged, stand-alone
    mobile application. This research will focus on developing a fully featured prototype
    that is optimized for adoption, retention, and efficacy. A mix of user feedback
    and rigorous usage analysis collected through human testing will provide necessary
    insights on barriers to use, missing functionality, and consumer value. Standardized
    markers of health safety, symptom escalations, and patient quality-of-life will
    be used as metrics of product performance. Moreover, all data and conclusions
    will be subjected to peer review through publication and public presentations.
    As an additional objective, the accuracy of the algorithmic triage recommendations
    will be tested on real patient cases to further validate their accuracy and effectiveness.
    The anticipated result of the phase I procedure is demonstration that the app
    is safe (objective 1), operationally sound and optimal (phase 2), and valuable
    to consumers (objective 3).\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    is a sustainable fruit and vegetable processing technology utilizing a new, low
    temperature technique that can extend the shelf life of pre-cut fruits and vegetables
    by months without using preservatives, chemicals, freezing, or refrigeration.
    \ The technology would enable: all-natural, shelf stable fruit and vegetable products
    that retain maximum nutritional value, texture, and taste.  With significant percentages
    of the total US national energy budget used for food-related energy, and high
    fresh produce loss in the developed countries due to insufficient refrigeration,
    achieving shelf life extension without cold storage or preservatives could drastically
    reduce energy costs, increase efficiency, and expand access to nutrition globally.
    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop, validate, and build-upon initial
    research to evaluate the feasibility and scope of a novel food processing technology.
    Traditional processing methodologies have fundamental drawbacks.  High temperature
    treatments degrade nutritional quality while altering texture and taste of end-products.
    Freezing negatively affects the reconstitution properties of fruits and vegetables,
    and requires high energy consumption throughout the food system to maintain the
    cold chain.  HPP (high pressure processing) has limitations on the enzymes it
    can inactivate, and chemical alterations from high pressure treatment negatively
    affects texture and taste.  This research proposal will use validation studies
    to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the novel processing technique
    to a variety of fruits and vegetables.  Successful experimentation will prove
    that the application of dense phase gas at low temperatures can overcome the aforementioned
    drawbacks, achieving enzymatic inactivation, destruction of the spores, improved
    reconstitution properties, lower energy requirements, and minimal deterioration
    of taste, texture, and nutritional quality.  Such a result would actuate follow-on
    development work to validate that, at commercial scale, the new process technology
    improves upon the operational costs of traditional methodologies.\n\nThis award

    Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of the cost of wind energy through a
    robust, inexpensive, and efficient vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). This project
    has the potential to increase global wind power production through technological
    advancements that lower installation, operations, and maintenance costs via an
    innovative design which addresses reliability and efficiency concerns that have
    previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market. Compared
    to the common horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT), the proposed technology requires
    an order of magnitude fewer components. Additionally, heavy and maintenance intensive
    components are located at ground level for ease of access. One initial market
    for this technology will be stand-alone, small-scale generation, where this technology
    will provide long-lasting, low-maintenance power for remote locations. Another
    initial market is the repowering and augmentation of existing wind turbine arrays.
    Here, this technology will be a cost effective method of revitalizing underperforming
    or aging HAWT farms. The long-term objective is large-scale, VAWT-only arrays.
    Recent scientific advances indicate that, unlike HAWTs, interactions between VAWTs
    can be beneficial, resulting in cost-effective, high-output wind farms. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the reliability and efficiency concerns
    that have previously limited the penetration of VAWTs into the wind energy market.
    XFlow Energy's novel design utilizes a robust, stationary central shaft extending
    the length of the rotor, reducing harmful loading to the rotor structure. This
    design requires a larger central shaft than VAWTs tested to date, and the impact
    of a large central shaft on VAWT power output has not been previously investigated.
    Laboratory-scale tests will be performed on a range of geometries to analyze the
    fluid-dynamic impact of larger central shafts and the resulting changes in turbine
    performance and loading. This information will inform the design and structural
    simulation of a 500 W turbine.  This design will be prototyped and will undergo
    thorough performance measurements. Ultimately destructive testing will be performed
    to identify structural deficiencies, and the design updated appropriately. The
    objective of SBIR Phase I is to produce a 500 W turbine that is thoroughly characterized,
    can survive up to 100 mph winds, and is ready for commercialization. This design
    will inform development of a utility-scale turbine (>50 kW) which will be the
    focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of a scalable, enterprise-ready conversational AI platform that enables businesses to automate customer support requests, optimize call routing efforts to get customers to the right human support agent, generate customer self-service resources like smart FAQs, augment human staff with bot capabilities, and enable personalized recommendations to support sales and purchasing decisions for customers. Such technology is beneficial to any enterprise organization, B2C (business-to-consumer) and B2B (business-to-business), who needs to communicate to customers, employees, and the public. With rising customer service and communication costs, automation is critical for businesses to maintain profitability and competitive advantages. On a societal level, conversational interfaces democratize access to information and resources worldwide. A significant portion of the world's population lives in regions where internet access is poor and device ownership is rare. Many also suffer from physical limitations, such as impaired vision or limited motor control. Accelerating technology access through conversational interfaces such as SMS and voice has already been shown to transform quality of life for disadvantaged groups through applications in telemedicine, personal finance, and education.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable human-level conversational ability in machines. Teaching computers to communicate like humans is a critical step to achieving human-level machine intelligence (HLMI), also called artificial general intelligence (AGI). Current state-of-the-art approaches to automated dialog systems use a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning implemented with deep neural network architectures. These approaches have shown promise on toy problems in academic research, but have mixed performance in enterprise settings. This Phase 1 project extends current deep learning approaches by developing a repeatable methodology for annotating and preparing enterprise data for use in dialog systems and a scalable, grounded neural network architecture that can reference external knowledge sources with minimal manual engineering.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to transform 2-way, mobile satellite communications from a niche service (affordable to less than 0.1% of the world?s people), to a broadly accessible mass market product (at costs well under $1/month).  Communications devices (that could be as small as vehicle key fobs) will communicate modest volumes of data to and from virtually anywhere on Earth.   The number of potential applications is large, with the following being a few examples:  every lifejacket on every commercial aircraft and cruise ship could transmit its location and status (in the event of a mishap); children and the elderly could be tracked globally; and drivers could be assured of assistance wherever they travel.   Secondary impacts would include an increase in average fuel efficiency when, for example, more vehicles are sold without spare tires (as drivers have more peace-of-mind regarding the possibility of being stranded).   The United States will benefit in terms of improved safety, conserved resources, stimulus to the satellite and related industries, and increased export revenues.

    The proposed project centers around a combination of innovations that exploit inherent (but previously unutilized) capabilities of existing satellites.  Currently operational Mobile Satellite Systems have communications architectures that do not lend themselves to low-cost transmission of small volumes of data.  By starting with a blank sheet of paper and rethinking the architecture, costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude (for both the communications devices and the data service).  The cost reduction of the terminal devices is primarily driven by lower data rates (with associated lower power and size).  While most technical aspects of communications links improve with lower data rates, one characteristic emerges as a constraint on the extent to which data rate can be reduced.  The purpose of this research is to study this characteristic, called phase noise, and its impact on the communications performance at low data rates when using real satellite links.  The results of this research will be quantitative conclusions regarding the trades between data rates, the cost impact of lowering phase noise in the communication elements, transmission performance, and the modem architectural options.  This study will enable optimization of this trade when developing the follow-on commercial products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be the development of a detection assay to reduce the incidence of Vibrio-related infections. Infections from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-borne infections and fatalities, respectively, and stem primarily from raw oysters. Development and implementation of rapid, accurate, inexpensive and easy-to-use testing methods would expand Vibrio data collection and enhance preventive measures by state shellfish labs (monitor harvest areas), and oyster processors and post-harvest processors (quality control at facilities). The assays will be available to users in simple, ready-to-prepare kits. These kits will make it easy for non-specialized personnel to test oyster lots still under refrigeration without disrupting logistics, and help U.S. oyster processors and post-harvest processors improve risk management tools and access export markets with restrictions on Vibrio levels. The tests also will improve environmental risk evaluations for harvest areas by state shellfish labs, FDA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other members of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. The tests will be marketed in the U.S., and other large oyster producing nations.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop two-phase, thermostable test tube media formulations for the detection and enumeration of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, total V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus in oysters. The goal is to demonstrate a) > 95% sensitivity and specificity of each test with pure cultures and oyster samples; b) 24-hr detection time; c) ease-of-use of the ready-to-prepare kits, based on time, steps, equipment, materials and feedback from industry; and d) low cost. The main technical hurdles are: 1) Increasing formulation volumes for test tube assays since linear increases of agar layer volumes in test tube media formulations could impact Vibrio organism motility, and consequently detection speed and accuracy; and 2) replacing a non-heat stable antibiotic component, Polymixin B of the V. vulnificus test, with a heat stable alternative, like ampicillin or lincomycin, to improve ease-of-use.

    a novel process and platform for the aerosol synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles.
    When coupled with an existing aerosol deposition technology, this aerosol synthesis
    source will enable the production of the next generation of functional coatings.
    These include antireflective and self-cleaning coatings for solar modules, novel
    electrical contacts that reduce silver usage in solar cells, and thermal barrier
    coatings for windows that increase thermal efficiency. Each of these represents
    a large addressable market in need of coatings innovation: For example, the coated
    flat glass market is expected to reach $43.2B in 2025 and the metal-oxide nanoparticle
    coatings from this project are anticipated to capture at least 10% of that market.
    Beyond the commercial and related societal impacts of the project, this project
    will increase the scientific understanding of the nucleation of nanomaterials
    in the gas phase and the subsequent manipulation of nanoparticles in low-pressure
    flows. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its development of a
    new method to synthesize metal-oxide materials in the gas phase, resulting in
    an aerosol that can be manipulated and deposited on a substrate with gas flows.
    Prior art for the synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles and the subsequent formation
    of films suffers from three challenges: (1) synthesis methods that utilize high-pressure
    gas-phase processes tend to create large light-scattering agglomerates that produce
    hazy films, (2) \"wet\" synthesis coating techniques can suffer from stability
    challenges, optical non-uniformities, and processes that are not easily scaled
    and (3) all methods have limited control of the optical properties of the film,
    specifically the refractive index. Synthesis of metal-oxide nanoparticles using
    the approach in this project is a promising, but under-examined and under-utilized,
    technique. It will generate unagglomerated nanoparticles of controllable size,
    overcoming the first challenge, and, with suitable aerosol deposition techniques,
    enable large-area uniform films with controllable refractive index, overcoming
    the second and third challenges.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish faster, less expensive, more accurate ways of determining the contents of biological samples leading to novel medical diagnostics, new drugs, and other new products beyond the reach of the current scientific methods that employ mass spectrometry. The project will develop technology that enables better software for mass spectrometry, and will make mass spectrometry-based sample analysis more accessible to a broader segment of academic and industrial scientists, disrupting a $100M market. Advanced software is required to transform raw experimental data into the lists of molecules and quantities needed to create new drugs, discover diseases and increase food production. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will enable the development of software built for the next generation of mass spectrometry, providing user-friendly, fast cloud software built on advanced, high-information algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop novel, high-information software technology for mass spectrometry data processing. The proposed work in Phase I will provide proof-of-concept for prototype development and testing in Phase II. The research will address three critical technical hurdles that are prerequisites to prototype development: 1) A mass spectrometry data storage and retrieval architecture sufficient to handle significantly more information from the hundreds of files in a typical study, 2) cloud-optimized versions of mass spectrometry information extraction algorithms, and 3) a cloud-based model-view controller framework that overcomes web-specific challenges for mass spectrometry data processing. The goal is to allow more experiments in the same amount of time without increasing costs, identifying more molecules than existing methods from the same experiment, and detecting molecules that are less abundant and go undetected by current methods.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will serve two complementary unmet market needs
    by: (1) accelerating the evaporation rate of brine ponds and enhancing salt production
    efficiency by 2-3 times; (2) condensing the moisture evaporated from contaminated/salty
    water so that one can obtain clean drinking water with n consumption of electricity.
    We will develop an enhanced solar vapor generation strategy based on a patent-pending
    electricity-free solar thermal technology. Specifically, we will develop/optimize
    functional materials to enhance the solar-driven vapor generation rate. The target
    is to double or even triple the salt production of mining companies relying on
    evaporation of brine ponds exposed to natural sun and wind. We will work with
    selected industrial partners to perform the field test in lithium brine ponds,
    which is the key source material for future Lithium battery industry. In addition,
    by condensing the evaporated moisture, we will aim to produce clean water using
    low cost materials and systems, which is a promising and sustainable solution
    to address the global drinking water scarcity using affordable electricity-free
    products in coastal and resource-limited areas. \n\nThe proposed project will
    aim to commercialize a patent-pending technology to realize an enhanced solar-driven
    water evaporator, which is highly desired for both solar mining production and
    clean water generation. Due to the superior solar energy absorption, heat conversion,
    and thermal insulating properties of our disclosed structure, most of the absorbed
    energy can be used to evaporate surface water with significantly reduced thermal
    dissipation. Remarkably, our pilot system has realized a record solar thermal
    conversion efficiency of >88% under illumination of 1 kW/m2 with no solar concentration.
    The corresponding vapor generation rate is ~1.28 kg/m2/h - a full 3X higher than
    the natural evaporation of bare water surfaces in the same environment. This Phase
    I SBIR effort will aim to overcome the remaining technical barriers for material
    and system optimization and scaling up strategies for manufacturing. By comparing
    the roll-to-roll coating and direct dying processes in this proposed research,
    we will select the best overall technology to complete our supply chain for the
    production in Phase II. In particular, we will perform field tests by working
    with solar mining industrial partners as well as Non-Government Organizations
    (NGO's) to get their feedback on how to improve the product in relevant environment. "

    This SBIR Phase I project will examine a new ultra-rapid 3D printing technology designed to break down important barriers to the future of Additive Manufacturing. The subject is a machine and materials set that can provide exponentially faster object generation at high resolution. This system leverages several familiar technologies in a new way to provide a path for 3D printing, generally considered reserved for the high-tech sectors, to become accessible to everyone. Because the new method is so rapid, detailed, and the materials are so diverse, it is poised to enhance plastics manufacturing profit margins by eliminating mold costs in many cases. In this way, many American business forced to outsource overseas will be able to maintain domestic production and increase the return of manufacturing jobs to the US. In addition, the manufacturing of the consumables will also enhance job creation. When this new method is fully adopted, its use in the medical field will make lifesaving and life enhancing prosthetic, implantable, and pharmaceutical testing applications much more cost effective, fundable by Medicare, benefiting all our citizens. By servicing a higher percentage of the general plastics manufacturing $600B industry, as well as professional designers, engineers, technical professionals, and the medical and scientific community, the new system in its many forms will eventually be of benefit to nearly every industry in the US, increasing the growth and practical value of the 3D market sector.


    The subject invention is unique in its use of multiple disciplines simultaneously. As a solid-state system, pressure-biased build material presses up against a glass screen, which is micro-porous, and is laced with the same kind of electronics as are found in flat screen displays. The discrete addressing normally reserved for video images, known as row-and-column refresh rates, is instead used to activate resistive material generating micro-heat spots in this open weave configuration. The heat stimulates the build material to transit the glass and solidify topside, at 1000 dpi resolution, or 1 million droplets per square inch. These high-resolution droplets conjoin and cool, as an entire layer is created at once at 30-120 times a second with no mechanical heads tracking back and forth. The objects should seem to simply appear on the glass at about one to seven vertical inches per minute, depending on the refresh rate, at virtually any planar size, and can be used right away, since no post-curing treatment is needed. Integrating an activated video matrix to build entire cross sections at once, increases speed exponentially. The pores in the glass rely on the known science of Microfluidics, a highly refined means of moving an entire 2D matrix of liquid, to eliminate costly and slow mechanization, and will be studied in this application. Robust and diverse materials have been developed for many embodiments and will be tested. Optimizing first in Multiphysics simulation, and then fabricating a simplified Proof of Concept in Phase I, should provide compelling evidence for continued work on this novel method in Phase II.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to improve law enforcement (LE) effectiveness in battling the illegal drug epidemic in the U.S. Death rates related to drug use have been increasing yearly and exceeded 72,000 Americans in 2017. To control this epidemic, the President?s 2019 Budget Request called for $30B in federal funding to combat illegal drug use, presenting a commercial opportunity to disrupt the existing market for conventional color test kits and Raman-based testing systems. Numerous interviews conducted with LE and forensic supply resellers demonstrate a readiness to adopt a new technology to replace drug test kits currently in use. This novel drug test system will improve the accuracy, reliability, ease of use, safety, and affordability of field drug identification and permit field use data analysis, which will help remove dangerous drugs from the streets. This innovation will also enhance the understanding of the chemical and photoluminescent properties of narcotic drugs reacting with various drug-indicator materials such as copper(I) iodide and validate the use of such information to identify suspected drugs. This is a wireless technology for the LE market sector, with the potential to eventually expand into the medical diagnostics and environmental analysis markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel system for on-site field drug testing for LE. Conventional chemical-based color tests are outdated and highly flawed, causing issues for end users and the rest of the drug enforcement ecosystem. These issues include false positive drug tests and the lack of ability to identify new drugs that are introduced into U.S. communities each year. Superior testing methods such as handheld Raman devices are too expensive for LE agencies to widely adopt, thus a low-cost technologically-innovative solution is necessary. This innovation leverages photoluminescence spectroscopy in four main components: a handheld spectrometer, a drug-sampling device, a mobile app with a matching algorithm and access to a cloud database of reference drug standards. The goal of this phase I project is to achieve a high-fidelity Minimum Viable Product drug testing system. The investigation of alternative fluorescent drug-indicators is anticipated to result in novel methods for drug identification with high selectivity and sensitivity. These methods will be implemented into a drug-sampling device. As a part of software and hardware optimization, beta testers within LE will help identify system shortcomings and provide input to develop enhancements for usability and ergonomics.

    This SBIR Phase I project supports development of an innovative device for use in laparoscopy (minimally invasive surgery of the abdomen). Laparoscopic injuries most often occur during primary port entry, before visualization into the abdominal cavity is possible. Injuries are primarily to the bowel or vasculature and are very serious, with mortality rates up to 5% for bowel injuries and up to 15% for vascular injuries. To minimize this risk, surgeons lift the abdominal wall away from the vital organs that could be inadvertently punctured during primary port entry. Two lifting techniques are commonly utilized, but one is unreliable and the other invasive. The product in development utilizes suction instead of mechanical force to grasp the abdominal wall and is more reliable and less invasive than the current techniques. Projected benefits include better surgical outcomes, increased surgeon and patient satisfaction, and decreased patient post-op pain. Successful development of this product is forecasted to create 40 new jobs by 2023 with an annual payroll exceeding $2.5M. As a direct result of this Phase I grant, this innovative product can reach the U.S. market in 2019 and become the gold standard for abdominal wall lifting devices in the next five years.

    The technical innovation in this proposed project is a novel abdominal lifting device for use in laparoscopic surgery that is more reliable and less invasive than current lifting techniques. The novelty of the innovation is affirmed with one issued patent and an additional pending patent application. The device takes advantage of existing suction available in every operating room.  This suction allows for the non-invasive attachment of the lifting device to the abdominal wall.  Current lifting techniques include manually grasping the abdominal wall and using perforating towel clips. Manual grasp does not always provide a secure grip and perforating towel clips invasively perforate abdominal wall tissue to provide a handle by which to lift and elevate. The technical goals of this project focus on creating a minimum viable product produced with biocompatible materials using standard good manufacturing practices for FDA Class I medical devices. Production quality samples will be produced with five different materials to determine which performs best in terms of strength, reliability, and flexibility. These samples will also be used to determine if any further design changes are needed prior to commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the global challenge of pollution abatement and air purification which have a profound impact on the environment, health, and economy. Hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on emission control activities, yet air pollution costs the global economy over five trillion of dollars annually in welfare costs and is attributed to one in every eight deaths. The design and performance of current industrial catalytic air purification technologies is insufficient to treat the growing number of airborne pollutants. Finding sustainable, cost-effective solutions to this problem, and is becoming increasingly important in view of tightening regulations. The technology we propose has a high commercialization potential due to the fact that it is cost-effective, shows excellent long-term performance and potential for scalable fabrication within an existing manufacturing framework within the United States.  Further, the founders of the company are inventors of the technology and have exclusive licensing of the core IP. Significantly, our demonstration of operating temperature reductions has been well-received by industry as evidenced by findings from our customer discovery effort through programs such as NSF I-Corps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses outstanding challenges in catalytic converters, notably technical challenges associated with cold start, durability, and high cost, which can be attributed to the use of substantial amounts of platinum group metals, and reliance on the limited reserves of these metals. Through highly controlled composition and nano-, micro-, and macro- structuration, we have previously demonstrated dramatically reduced precious metal content in a catalytic decomposition of known pollutants. The research objectives of this SBIR project are to develop a scalable deposition method of these advanced catalytic materials onto industrially relevant substrates, to promote and accelerate their integration into commercial products to tackle the growing problem of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The technical work will involve the synthesis of these materials and modifications to the synthetic schemes in a way that will be compatible with such large-scale deposition processes, as well as longevity, robustness, and catalytic testing. It will require building equipment for the deposition. Overcoming the technological challenges that are the subject of this SBIR Project will facilitate translation of the nanostructured materials to a broad range of catalytic applications related to pollution abatement and air purification.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing chemically cross-linked
    synthetic nanomaterials to address the unmet clinical need in promoting infection
    free tissue regeneration in surgical, traumatic, ocular, burn, and chronic wounds.
    While small wounds heal naturally, larger chronic wounds demonstrate delayed wound
    healing with infections, and affect over 6.5 million patients costing over US
    $25 billion annually in treatments. In addition, annually, 2 million Americans
    suffer from serious infections due to drug resistant bacteria resulting in severe
    morbidity, serious complications, huge economic losses with an estimated 23,000
    deaths. As conventional antibiotics are failing, our ability to fight drug resistant
    pathogens is diminishing and the pipeline of new potential antibiotic drugs is
    very skim. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a product that can fight multiple
    pathogens through a mechanism against which bacteria are less likely to develop
    further resistance. Hence, the current project evaluates the feasibility of developing
    a novel, easily handleable dry film with potential to eliminate a variety of infectious
    pathogens while improving wound healing in a single application. This product
    is pliable, easily rehydratable, has intrinsic tissue scaffolding properties and
    is inherently antimicrobial against a broad range of pathogens without the use
    of any additional agents.  \n \nThis SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the
    feasibility of developing a shape retaining, pliable, easily handleable antimicrobial
    cell-scaffolding gel matrix into a product that is simultaneously toxic to antibiotic-resistant
    bacterial strains, while remaining conducive to tissue regeneration. This current
    product has a nano-porous gel matrix that promotes cellular infiltration and attachment
    along with utilizing a charge-based mechanism to lyse bacterial membranes upon
    contact. Although there is on-going research on such self-assembled hydrogels,
    the formation of films using these nanofibers has never been assessed before and
    stands to be the key technological advancement. Thus, this current proposal explores
    two methods for making films such as i) solvent casting methods relying on non-covalent
    crosslinking - where the hydrogel is applied to a surface and then allowed to
    dry into a film overnight, and ii) Covalent crosslinking by - incorporating cysteines
    by oxidizing using H2O2 or crosslinking using Schiff base formation followed by
    reductive deamination. The films so formed will be structurally and functionally
    evaluated for their ability to eliminate infections and biocompatibility.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the increase in efficiency and reduction in cost of gathering information in surface water environments using unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). USVs have the potential to increase accessibility to bodies of water, enhance coverage, and make data collection safer by removing humans from the task. However, to fully realize the potential of USVs for gathering information, a level of autonomy with minimal need for human supervision and intervention is required. The development of this technology will open the door to the pervasive use of USVs for environmental data collection, and ultimately benefit society through: i) more information upon which to base decisions about resource management and environmental policy; ii) higher frequency of data collection activities through reduced cost; and iii) increased safety by keeping human personnel out of harsh environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lay the foundation for a transformative approach to environmental data collection in surface waters. The intellectual merit of this project lies in addressing technical challenges that will enable unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to effectively navigate autonomously in complex surface waters that may contain a range of diverse obstacles, which would otherwise be inaccessible or at best require a high degree of human supervision. This will be achieved by advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning toward intelligent obstacle characterization. The proposed framework interprets images or video of obstacles to extract salient features, such as flexibility or rigidity, through the innovative use of machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and tools borrowed from the analysis of collective behavior. This extra layer of information provided through the proposed framework represents a significant advancement in computer vision, which offers direct benefits to environmental monitoring and data collection by empowering USVs with new unmanned capabilities.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project builds a new query engine for K12 that
    addresses four major shortcomings in existing automated question-answering systems.
    The shortcomings prevent both students and teachers from fully leveraging the
    power of such systems. Existing systems 1) cannot handle raw student queries like
    - Ten Ford Fiestas cost $146,000. How much does each Ford Fiesta cost?, 2) do
    not take into account students' skill-levels to return results that is within
    the scope of their understanding, 3) do not have a community vetting and feedback
    mechanism that allows systems to learn the quality of their automated answers,
    and 4) discard valuable insights obtainable from students' queries that can be
    used to inform future classroom instruction. The query engine, which is free to
    use, addresses all four shortcomings, improves classroom instruction and closes
    the achievement gap. It empowers students of all abilities and from all communities
    to obtain automated answers from the AI technology and regular answers from the
    community of users. The community of users on the platform range from students
    to teachers to experts from the industry fulfilling their corporate social responsibilities.
    The platform is compliant with federal and state privacy regulations and is projected
    to earn significant Annual Recurring Revenue from corporations and EdTech companies
    seeking to build their brand among the K12 community. \n\n\nThis project develops
    new skill-aware AI technology that automatically maps student's raw queries into
    topics, sub-topics and intent. The technology considers the user skill-levels
    and automatically constructs an answer extracted from the most relevant educational
    resources, with highest preference given to teachers' own resources. The technology
    does something more if the detected topic falls under Algebra and the intent of
    the query is 'How do I solve this?' It generates, on-the-fly, additional scaffolding
    instructions for solving the problem. This approach extends to disciplines beyond
    Algebra. In addition, Phase I research leverages the latest advancements in Machine
    Learning, Natural Language Processing and Topic Detection to extract and track
    skill-levels, as well as strengths and weaknesses of students for teacher's benefit.
    Finally, the project will also demonstrate the efficacy of the technology in terms

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a protein sample preparation kit that eliminates variability and provides researchers with the information they need to find important protein drug targets and biomarkers.  The high throughput protein analysis methods of proteomics are having a significant impact on the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, from the development of new protein-based drugs to quality control monitoring and biomarker discovery to clinical diagnostics. All proteomics applications require robust, repeatable and automatable sample preparation methods. Currently, however, these methods are not standardized. The lack of the standardization often leads to experimental failure and unreliable results, which may require many rounds of experimental repeats, costing time and money. Standardized protein sample preparation kits will provide significant workflow savings, improve time to market, and accelerate biomarker discovery and drug development.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a universal peptide isolation kit to serve the diverse needs of the proteomics community.  Currently, methods for sample preparation typically have more than a dozen steps, are prone to peptide loss and bias, and require more than a day to complete.  Through the NSF I-Corps program, it was discovered that more than 70% of researchers in academia and industry are unhappy with current protein sample preparation methods.  To address this need, a sample preparation kit that increases the speed and efficiency of peptide sample preparation was developed. The approach differs from current methods in three fundamental ways.  First, all manipulations will be done in solution in a single tube with half the number of steps compared to existing protocols. Second, a fast, universal, and reversible chemical tag is employed rather than relying on physical separation, preventing sample loss or bias. Third, a stabilized derivative of trypsin will allow for complete digestion of protein samples followed by efficient removal of intact and fragmented trypsin, preventing contamination.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses the problem of assessing blood clotting and associated bleeding and thrombosis risks in neonatal and pediatric patients. Existing coagulation analyzers put these patients at further risk because they cannot operate with low volumes of blood, and because they are less reliable owing to the requirement for test sample contact. This project will develop Acoustic Tweezing Thomboelastometry (ATT) for these patients.  Using only a single acoustically-levitated drop of blood, this non-contact technology platform enables safe and reliable assessment of blood clotting in small children and provides an opportunity for development of newborn screening tests for coagulation abnormalities. This technology is the outcome of NSF funding which has supported the training of several PhD students in biomedical and mechanical engineering.  ATT can reduce side effects for neonatal and pediatric patients by using 1/100th the sample volume required by technologies developed for adult healthcare and improve diagnostic response time for critical care providers by up to 350%. This technology could decrease the cost of blood coagulation analysis by over 30%, thus allowing for patients in the United States to save $2.0 billion annually.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops an innovative technology for non-contact blood coagulation analysis that integrates photo-optical and viscoelastic measurements in a single drop of blood (<6uL in volume).  The essence of the ATT technology is to levitate a small sample in a host fluid (e.g., air) by the acoustic radiation force and measure its physical properties under deformation during levitation.  ATT addresses the issue of high variability and poor standardization of existing coagulation analyzers caused by blood sample contact with artificial surfaces. Due to its noncontact feature and low sample volume requirement, ATT can rapidly (<10 minutes) and reliably assess bleeding/thrombotic risks and is sensitive to temporal changes in shear viscosity and elasticity during blood clotting and fibrinolysis.  In addition, ATT can measure platelet function and assess the functional levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors. The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly minimal marketable product for the market of pediatric coagulation analyzers. This goal will be achieved by meeting the following three objectives: 1) build the user-friendly prototype; 2) develop integrated software for device control, data acquisition, and data analysis; and 3) calibrate the prototype and standardize it for coagulation measurements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the implementation of digital pathology by giving pathologists computational guides to help them achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in making their "calls". Currently biopsy diagnosis is a labor-intensive process that relies upon 19th century microscope technology; pathologists are doctors who use microscopes to make diagnoses. Pathologists examine slides from breast biopsies as part of breast cancer screening programs for more than a million women each year in the US.  This is a highly subjective process and there is evidence that even pathologists may disagree with one another, especially with difficult cases. This is potentially large patient safety issue, as some patients may not be optimally triaged.  It is currently possible to digitize the slides as whole slide images (WSIs), but there are very limited options for computer assisted pathologist review and this is a major reason that the digital pathology market has not developed as rapidly as most experts predicted. This project is a major advance as it addresses a large clinical need ? augmenting pathologists in their ability to make efficient and accurate diagnoses; and it also has great commercial potential as a disruptive, must-have application in the early digital pathology marketplace.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the issue of accuracy and efficiency of pathologist diagnosis in breast core biopsies, and this should validate our approach as an unmet need in the current digital pathology marketplace. There are other groups applying machine learning to pathology, but this project is a unique approach that addresses practical issues related to expert training of the machine, rapidly displaying targeted images to pathologists, and providing a guiding support while keeping the doctors in control. The project will ask pathologists to label WSIs with their diagnoses; this data will be used to train an AI system; and the AI system performance will be studied. Preliminary studies seem to support that a human and AI system working together will be both more efficient and more accurate than a human working alone. If this expanded project validates this, then there is a tremendous commercial opportunity that can also have a positive impact on patients. Not only access to better diagnoses for patients, but also the possibility for any pathologist to perform at a higher level.

- abstractText: "This Small Technology Transfer Phase I project will realize a sensorized
    soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with an interactive 3D virtual reality (VR)
    gaming environment that provides fine motor training for stroke patients' hands.
    There is a currently a lack of available devices that provide fine sensory and
    motor training of the hand. The potential benefit is to fill this niche market
    opportunity, especially when considering the high incidence of hand disability
    due to stroke and other neuromusculoskeletal injuries. This system can provide
    structured therapy sessions which requires minimal therapist supervision while
    improving patient engagement which enhances the broader participation. As a complimentary
    technology for current rehabilitation practice, it has a potential to lower health
    care and labor costs associated with neurological rehabilitation. The outpatient
    physical rehabilitation market is a $30 billion industry growing at a rate of
    7% in the US, mainly due to the growing elderly population. The robot-assisted
    rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by
    2020. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available, the customer base
    will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally
    to home-based care. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project results from the
    combination of a soft robotic system with fine motor control synced to VR games
    for both sensory and motor stimuli. The robotic exoskeleton provides individual
    joint control to practice complex grasping while the VR environment provides targeted
    rehabilitation games. This system addresses the fine motor control needs that
    have not been met by current hand rehabilitation devices, which only offer gross
    motions. Adaptive algorithms will adjust to the patient's level of ability to
    accomplish the assigned tasks in virtual game scenarios, providing accessibility
    for a wide range of population with different levels of severity. There are three
    main goals for the project. First, we will develop a VR environment simulating
    real-world hand motion via interaction with objects in an immersive game. Second,
    we will develop adaptive control algorithms for the soft robotic exoskeleton to
    provide active assistive motion in performing rehabilitation-oriented tasks in
    the VR environment. Third, a pilot study will be conducted with both healthy individuals
    and hand-impaired stroke patients. The Phase I project will produce a system with
    assistive hand motion in a targeted rehabilitation virtual game environment, which
    can be tested for efficacy in a larger clinical population of stroke survivors.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project lays in its ability to enable reconfigurable hardware acceleration in the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Users under constrained power at the edge will be able to choose a new solution that can bring acceleration, and enable datacenter like capabilities, and benefit from the IoT's long-sought promise.  Using Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) to develop a next-generation Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), increasing performance while reducing energy consumption at the sensor node level, is possible. As already experienced in our data driven world, it is critical that we improve our computing capabilities at the edge in order to gain in responsiveness and increase our energy efficiency. With evermore data and performance requirements to deliver on the consumer demands, innovative uses of emerging memories are showing great promise and providing capabilities that will help fulfill the IoT's potential. If fulfilled, this technology has the potential to enable a whole set of data driven applications at the edge, such as low-energy image recognition and learning in drones to operate longer and more effectively or long-lasting medical implants with leading data aggregation and reactiveness.

    This Small Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will aim to commercialize a patented technology to realize a ultra-low-power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based on Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM). To handle the data explosion in Internet of Things (IoT) network, the industry is moving towards increasing intelligent analysis capability for single IoT devices. Tight power budget has become a critical road block: high-end solutions, such as multicore CPUs, GPUs, can provide enough computing capability but fail to meet the power budget, while low-power commercial products, such as micro-controllers and low-power FPGAs, can satisfy power constraints but hardly follow the increasing complexity in data analysis algorithms. This project aims to develop a ultra-low-power FPGA that can offer high-performance data analysis capability under IoT-level power limits. This project will prototype a FPGA chip built around an innovative RRAM-based routing multiplexer design. We will also release an associated software tool suite to support the implementation of customer's applications on the technology. Compared to existing commercial solutions, the proposed FPGA product is expected to demonstrate similar computing capability as high-end FPGA solutions while satisfying an IoT power budget (<1W).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable the development of monolithic 3D integration of carbon nanotube (CNT) computing in conjunction with silicon nanoelectronics. The value of nanoelectronics utilizing silicon integrated with CNT has been shown to have immense potential through various academic studies. However, the transition of this technology from academia to industry has been stymied by lack of CNT material that meets the manufacturing requirements particularly in terms of alignment, purity, and compatibility to be properly explored. Monolithic 3D integration will enable game-changing levels of improvement to computing speed and power efficiency, creating better computing for all. Providing a material which accelerates research and development for improved computing will create a game changing impact on the $500B integrated circuit market and potentially create billions of dollars in revenue. This project is focused on the needs of the nanoelectronics industry because of the impact possible in that market, but other markets such as biosensing or flexible electronics would benefit from the same materials and often at relaxed specifications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will greatly expand the utilization of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in nanoelectronics by making industrially relevant material available. This will allow application oriented nanoelectronics teams to move forward with R&D projects. Further, the project's work on the fundamentals of aligned CNT growth and purification will benefit the CNT materials community by the extension of the material into commercial manufacturing. The research objectives are on two fronts: 1) growth of CMOS compatible aligned CNTs and 2) purification of aligned CNTs. Growth of highly aligned CNT populations has typically utilized catalysts which are not compatible with front end of line CMOS fabrication, hindering the use of material in conjunction with Si integrated circuits. Current methods of CNT purification to remove metallic CNTs suffer from either destroying the critical CNT alignment, utilization of non-CMOS compatible materials, or the need of extensive post-processing. This project will develop a growth process and a purification process that preserves alignment while maintaining CMOS compatibility and utilizes wafer scale batch processes that allow high throughput manufacturing. The purification scheme is a proprietary method which must be characterized and refined to meet the exacting purification standards of 99.99% semiconducting CNTs or better.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from the development of quantum computers that will impact many technologies by enabling, for example, molecular simulations for drug design and catalyst development for energy applications, quantum machine learning, and solving optimization problems such as scheduling. Scalable, universal quantum computing promises to be one of the most transformative technologies of the modern era. The range of applications are broad and will only expand with the development of new quantum algorithms, with one of the biggest opportunities being molecular simulations for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. For example, despite being a multi-billion dollar industry, computational drug discovery is limited by the approximations necessary to make calculations tractable for classical computers. In order to perform these simulations at a scale useful for commercial applications, qubit numbers must be increased several orders of magnitude beyond the state of the art. The proposed innovation of trapping and individual control of neutral atoms will, if successful, enable quantum computers to scale to the thousands of qubits needed for error-corrected, universal quantum computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop technology for scalable trapping and addressing of neutral atom qubits through dynamic, parallelized optical trapping and individual addressing of alkaline earth qubits. Neutral atoms are an emerging platform for quantum computing and the majority of work thus far has been directed towards alkali atoms (i.e., those with a single valence electron). Alkaline earth atoms have two valence electrons and correspondingly a richer energy level structure, which has demonstrated very long trapped coherence times.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to make organizations more productive by helping them organize operational data in a structured yet accessible way. Today, organizations tend to accumulate such data in spreadsheets, scattered across users and folders, with new copies and revisions being made every time data must be presented, summarized, or integrated in a new way. This leads to tedious cut-and-paste workflows, costly errors, and a lack of reliable information for decision support. This project proposes a general-purpose software solution, based on a recently developed method for interactive database visualization. The system's novelty is in the ease and flexibility with which data can be queried and laid out on the screen, covering a large range of use cases that would previously require custom programming. Applications can be found in all manner of organizations: corporations, non-profits, higher education, science, healthcare, journalism, disaster response, the military, public administration, and so on.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a general-purpose, user-friendly software product that individuals within an organization can use to store and share structured data along with the various data displays through which said data is viewed, queried, and edited. Such data displays could include arbitrary database queries, visualizations such as crosstabs, calendars, and bar charts, as well as non-tabular multi-query visualizations such as forms, dashboards, and hierarchical reports. Using the proposed software, organizations can decrease time spent on administrative and managerial tasks, improve the use of data in decision-making, and, in many cases, eliminate yearlong internal software development projects.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project are its two intended contributions: it will advance computer vision for navigation and it will create unprecedented opportunity and independence for individuals with visual impairment. 253 million people with blindness or visual impairment around the world experience difficulty to independently navigate in new spaces. The lack of independence directly leads to disadvantages in getting education and joining the workforce. This project, NavigAid,  is aimed at creating a breakthrough spatial intelligence aid offered as a mobile application which will solve spatial tasks from locating objects to identifying paths of navigation, and to generating rich descriptions of the surroundings. Solving this problem will unlock an estimated direct economic benefit of $26B  annually for people with visual impairment around the world, by decreasing the need for human assistance. The main technological innovation of this project, Ally Networks, is a novel neural network architecture that can learn more robust representations than existing models are able to. The robust representations prevent the networks from making mistakes and make them more operable and useful in situations that need high reliability. Ally Networks thus represent a potential breakthrough to the field of computer-vision navigation.


    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will introduce a novel spatial intelligence system, NavigAid, to assist individuals with visual impairment in crucial navigation tasks. NavigAid will generate contextually relevant, task-oriented spatial information from smartphone cameras. With NavigAid, users will be able to navigate independently in unfamiliar, complex environments, thus achieving unprecedented mobility. NavigAid will advance assistive technologies by providing unprecedented services, such as locating objects and generating functionally relevant natural language descriptions of complex environments. The core innovation in this project is Ally Networks, a novel neural network architecture that learns robust spatial semantics rather than 2-dimensional representations. This unique multimodal learning strategy is a high-risk endeavour, with broad impact if successful. Large-scale multimodal learning is difficult, and our technique?s success will revolutionize the state of the art: neural network vision will transform from systems that fail in inscrutable ways, to systems that never fail under circumstances in which human vision would not also fail. Key objectives of this project are to 1) develop and validate Ally Networks on benchmarks, 2) develop spatial problem solvers that address the most pressing needs of users with visual impairment, and 3) develop a test suite to evaluate the spatial problem solvers.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to address the lack of approved device
    therapies available for the almost 4 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from
    diastolic heart failure (DHF) - a disease for which the potential market is estimated
    to be approximately $5B worldwide. In DHF, the chambers of the heart become stiff
    and cannot relax completely, reducing the amount with which they fill with blood
    and thus reducing the amount of blood pumped by the heart during each cardiac
    cycle. The only evidence-based therapy to treat DHF is to manage blood pressure
    pharmacologically, and treat associated complications. DHF is a major cause of
    hospital admissions and has poor patient outcomes, without any discernable improvement
    over the last two decades. Thus, there is a strong need for an effective device
    solution that can alleviate the symptoms associated with DHF while improving patient
    outcomes, as well as further fundamental understanding of the key factors and
    mechanisms that lead to DHF. \n\nThis project is focused on the development of
    a non-blood contacting biventricular diastolic recoil device for the treatment
    of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), also
    referred to as diastolic heart failure (DHF). The proposed device will provide
    a patented minimally invasive, non-blood contacting approach to mitigate the symptoms
    associated with HFpEF, addressing a large unmet need in a market which currently
    lacks any approved device therapies. Primary goals of this Phase I project include
    investigating variations in device design, functionality, and mechanical properties
    in pilot animal studies in order to optimize augmentation of cardiac function
    and hemodynamics, as well as the development of an accelerated fatigue test apparatus
    to test the durability of the device components. The commercialization effort
    in bringing this novel device to market will address the largely unmet need for
    the millions of Americans who suffer from DHF by alleviating symptoms, significantly
    increasing quality of life, and reducing morbidity and mortality.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the productivity and environmental sustainability of soybean cultivation. Soybean is the most widely grown crop in the United States with nearly 90 million acres under cultivation. Soybean is a key part of the food system and generates $22 billion in export revenue each year. One of the greatest threats to soybean production is the fungal pathogen known as Asian Soybean Rust. Current commercial soybean varieties have no resistance to this pathogen and over $2 billion is spent annually on fungicides to control this disease. While soybean is highly susceptible to this disease, many wild plant species have natural resistance to this pathogen. This project seeks to identify the naturally occurring mechanisms of disease resistance in wild plant species that can be used to develop disease-resistant soybean varieties. Adoption of these varieties is expected to bring more than $4 billion in value to the soybean industry while improving productivity and reducing fungicide use.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer disease resistance to Asian Soybean Rust, which is caused by the fungal pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. A key determinant of whether or not a plant is resistant to a particular pathogen is whether the plant has an appropriate immune receptor protein capable of recognizing the presence of the invading pathogen. Once activated, plant immune receptors trigger plant defense responses that typically result in immunity. This project will use reverse genetic and biochemical approaches to identify plant immune receptor proteins that confer resistance to Asian Soybean Rust. Preliminary work identified several molecules from Phakopsora that elicit an immune response in non-host plant species. The goal is to identify the cognate immune receptors and test them for sufficiency to enable immune activation in response to Asian Soybean Rust elicitor molecules. This research will enable future work to the development soybean varieties with resistance to Asian Soybean Rust.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of new fluorescent materials that will provide new color technologies to the paint, polymer, and ink industries. These new materials will overcome the undesirable properties of commercial fluorescent pigments, like a tendency to rapidly fade, give weak color strength, and degrade during processing. Besides giving fabrics, packaging, and toys bright, attractive colors, improvements to fluorescent pigments could change several parts of daily life: Brighter paints and signs could improve road and airport safety. Product designers for next-generation consumer electronics will have a new color palette for their newest gadget. Agricultural scientists would have a new tool to study crop treatments. As a result, success in this research project has the potential to claim a share of the multi-billion dollar colorant market, disrupt expectations around fluorescent pigments, bring new products to consumers, and create high-tech jobs. In addition, this project leverages collaboration with academic partners, supporting science and entrepreneurship education of university students and postdoctoral fellows.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides a revolutionary solution to a problem that has haunted chemistry for more than 150 years. Existing fluorescent materials are formulated with pigments that have thinly dispersed colorants, which dilutes their color and makes them susceptible to degradation. This is done by necessity, because fluorescent dyes have a tendency to aggregate, causing unwanted color changes and loss of the fluorescence effect. This solution utilizes a bottom-up "self-assembly" strategy to eliminate aggregation and create stable fluorescent solids that maximize the longevity and boldness of the color. This research will study this novel class of fluorescent pigment to gauge its resistance to fading, improved chromaticity, and material performance in realistic conditions. This will be done by measuring changes to fluorescence intensity and color appearance under natural and laboratory-accelerated weathering conditions, and creating test "products" in the form of paints and polymers. These test materials are expected to have stronger color for longer periods of time while still being amenable to commercial processing techniques. In addition, this project is an opportunity to study the behavior of self-assembling materials inside polymer formulations, which is a new research area with broad scientific and commercial potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable Fortify to provide U.S. manufacturers with a disruptive manufacturing technology to create low-volume tooling parts with order of magnitude reductions in lead times and part price. U.S. manufacturers rely on prototype and low-volume production parts that are currently produced using aluminum soft tooling that need to be precision machined. Prices for these small run parts can reach USD $10,000 or more per tool, depending on complexity, with lead times extending weeks or months. This results in high unit costs when parts are produced in low volumes. Industry data suggests the market for outsourced prototype and low volume injection molded parts with physical dimensions serviceable by Fortify technology may be as large as USD $2.7 Billion.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable Fortify to create a thermal competitive advantage to enable customer discovery in the field of low-volume injection molding tooling. Despite the noise in the field of 3D printing, disrupting the injection molding tooling industry has remained elusive due to the lasting need for high strength, thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and smooth mold finish in 3D printed molds. Fortify is uniquely positioned to address these technical challenges by leveraging novel materials, patented manufacturing hardware, and proprietary manufacturing software. Fortify prints ceramic-filled, high-temperature resins that are locally textured by magnetic fields in customized magnetic printers to produce optimum ceramic microstructures designed by Fortify's INFORM software to maximize the thermomechanical performance of the printed parts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a new generation of machine learning/artificial intelligence tools for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment systems. Over $160 billion is spent on sewer fees in the U.S., with year-to-year costs increasing by over 5% for many users. Even with the significant resources spent on wastewater treatment, 3 to 10 billion gallons of untreated sewage are still released from US wastewater treatment plants each year. Development of technologies leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to better manage complex biological and chemical processes will not only have a major impact on the $91 billion wastewater treatment system control market, but on other biochemical-dependent industries as well. In addition to reducing the societal financial burden associated with wastewater treatment, this technology will improve the sustainability of the infrastructure and will limit the environmental impact of human activities. Wastewater operators will be able to utilize this technology's real-time decision-making software to significantly reduce their municipal facility operating costs and decrease environmental pollution caused by non-compliance and overflows.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop real-time software for assisting wastewater treatment operators with decision-making for improved efficiency and effectiveness. Existing commercial simulation solutions for control and monitoring do not accurately reflect actual treatment plant behavior, do not model biological processes, do not require extensive configuration to be used, and do not respond rapidly to changes in plant performance. This project improves upon current approaches by linking biological components of the wastewater treatment plant with historical data using machine learning techniques. Phase I research will focus on development of: 1) an influent flow/composition model allowing accurate model inputs; 2) a full-scale hybrid model combining physical process and machine-learning bioprocess modules able to accurately predict plant effluent flow and quality, and; 3) a software platform to manage the model processes. The technical approach will focus on balancing the complexity of incorporating large-scale genomic data as part of a non-linear treatment process while ensuring high accuracy and maintaining model stability. Anticipated technical results will provide waste operators a software product that develops full-scale treatment plant models in real-time, using historical and current plant data, enabling significantly improved operational decision-making.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project pertains to the novel production of short-fiber reinforced thermoplastic material applicable to a range of processes, with the added benefit of utilizing  high quality, low cost recycled or recovered fibers. The beachhead application is in a powder-based additive manufacturing system capable of mid-scale manufacturing that can bridge between prototype-stage and capital-intensive injection molded economy-of-scale manufacturing. Such systems can be located in regional production hubs to accelerate new or highly-customizable products to market. The inclusion of the proposed additives in these systems will expand the range of end-product material properties available, and thereby expand the potential client pool for the same platform. Anticipated flow properties of the material will position it as an accessible additive option for other 3D printing technologies as well as the much larger-market of injection molding processing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project adapts a processing technology that is yet untapped for this application, to produce a composite thermoplastic additive for polymeric powder feedstock 3D printing. This additive is expected to increase stiffness, strength, and thermal stability of the end product, while reducing weight and providing superior handling characteristics during production relative to existing alternatives. The project is focused on identifying process conditions required to produce a nominally conforming product, followed by testing that characterizes the material and handling properties. Results of these tests will be compared against acceptance standards published by the beachhead additive manufacturing system supplier in preparation for inclusion into 3D printed test components.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a coating product with superior durability and antifouling performance in the targeted environmental-friendly marine coating market. This innovative solution requires a less frequent application and reduces the amount of subaquatic growth on the hull of ships and static objects in bodies of water. Potential economic benefits include improving fuel efficiency and saving the maintenance cost of ships and static marine structures. At the same time, this product provides enormous environmental benefits by reducing the greenhouse gas emission from cargo ships and avoiding the potential species invasion caused by current marine coatings. In particular, this product is the first non-biocide environmentally friendly product of its kind. It addresses the current and future needs highlighted by global regulations to replace the existing harmful biocide-leaching coatings with an eco-friendly solution.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize a novel marine coating product to deliver a high-performing eco-friendly antifouling solution that is currently lacking in the marketplace. Current self-polishing coating products were subject to increasing regulatory restriction, while alternative environmental-friendly option such as fouling-release coating suffered low antifouling performance. This novel coating technology potentially achieves the durability and high antifouling performance for targeted marine applications, and the eco-friendly feature without leaching biocide into the aqueous environment. The objective of this project is to explore the key fabrication factors in coating formulation and identify their impacts on the coating stability and antifouling performance. Critical knowledge will be obtained enables the development of prototype product showing year-long reliability and top marine antifouling function.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to broader adoption of newer medical technologies and increased revenue for medical device companies, decreased training costs, and decreased liability from misuse or lack of appropriate training on medical devices. Research has shown that surgical skill is directly related to a variety of patient outcomes, yet there are few tools that can reliably and affordably measure surgical proficiency. Providing objective measurements of surgical proficiency is not enough; the assessment method must also identify areas of difficulty during a task to improve the surgeon's future performance. The proposed innovation is an objective and scalable way to measure procedural competency using head and hand motion-tracking data collected in a surgical simulation and applying novel, deep-learning algorithms to the analysis. By providing surgeons with real-time feedback during training, this project will allow surgeons to rapidly improve training on specialized devices, thus leading to wider adoption of new technology. Adoption of this surgical assessment platform in medical schools and operating rooms across the country will enable an objective assessment of surgical proficiency, thus reducing training time and costs and lowering risk of medical error due to underdeveloped skills.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an innovative, deep-learning Surgical Training and Assessment Platform to increase the commercial viability of a Virtual Reality (VR) surgical training program. VR surgical training technology holds enormous potential in improving the efficiency of learning by allowing for unlimited practice and rehearsal of surgical procedures; however, without the ability to reliably assess performance, such platforms cannot be used to their full potential. This application will translate the simulation environment into a vehicle for technical skills assessment to prevent trainees from graduating to independent practice without first proving competency in critical areas. The novel, proprietary software algorithms developed in this proposal will allow for the above applications and broad improvements to training efficiency and patient safety through the tracking and analysis of hand and head motion as a surrogate measure for surgical expertise. The Surgeon Assessment Platform will be developed by determining the most vital head and hand motion data to collect and validating the resulting assessment dataset in a small proof-of-concept study, while meeting the challenge of collecting, storing, and analyzing such a large, high-fidelity dataset.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to offers a way for semiconductor chip fabricators to extend Moore's Law and simultaneously allowing them to reduce costs in consumables and scrap wafers that have been damaged during polishing. Currently chip fabricators are challenged to continue Moore's Law due to the complexity and scale down sizes of semiconductor device structures. Improved computer chip performance is critical to countless applications as computers,mobile phones, tablets, and Internet of Thing have become ubiquitous in everyday life.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenges which the semiconductor industry faces trying to move beyond 14 nm technologies by using Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Polishing pads are used to planarize wafer surface for multilayer stack integration. Conventional polishing pad technology has randomly distributed micro pores that lead to non-uniform polishing and scratched due to stress concentration on asperities with less than 1% real contact area. Additionally, conventional pads require a pad conditioning process to re-generate pad surface. This project proposes engineering micro features on the pad surface using micro fabrication technologies. In addition, the real contact area between the pad and wafer will be controllable increasing to 5-10 percent of the total pad-wafer contact. This will make the polishing performance more precise and consistent. The micro features are designed to retain polishing slurry longer so to increase the number of active slurry abrasives for polishing. The contact area and feature design will be tunable to specific polishing performance requirements per customer applications. The independent multi-body structure of a hard top-pad with a soft sub-pad will increase the conformity of the pad and distribute the pressure from polishing evenly across the pad surface. This will significantly improve the chip-level planarization and wafer-level uniformity, as well as reducing the pad wear during polishing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the reinvention of community wellness programming from a typically qualitative process into an evidence-based procedure. Treating wellness as a science will allow for more efficacious use of wellness budgets (an annual expenditure exceeding $100 Billion), will create a positive social impact within organizations, and by extension, society as a whole. Organizations with effective wellness initiatives have higher employee engagement, improved productivity, and increased profitability. Hence, there is significant opportunity for societal and commercial impact through evidence-based wellness technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the theoretical development, and practical deployment, of recommendation algorithms that arrange meetings between groups of people with divergent interests and incentives. Our research objectives are (1) the development of a theoretically grounded recommendation algorithm that accounts for the effects of social dynamics and incentives on behavior, (2) the development of an application to facilitate community wellness through in-person meetings.  We anticipate the successful deployment of the platform, the collection of multi-center data for semi-supervised training and prospective evaluation of the developed algorithms.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make talent search faster and much more effective. More specifically, it will aim to make it easier to connect open jobs with the talents of job seekers. The innovation proposed here will redefine job search in a time when the labor market is in major flux, and the technology developed in this project will enable job searching to move far beyond a one-page resume and focus more on the skills needed to succeed in a job. In so doing, the innovation will enable job seekers to find new opportunities that are aligned with their career interests and enable employers to find skilled talent matched to their project needs. Employers using this technology will be able to search for talent according to what they need performed, without necessarily knowing how the task will be performed. Similarly, job seekers will be able to search for jobs that they may not have known existed but are still strongly aligned with their career goals.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a skills-to-tasks matching system that serves as a basis for which worker skills are employed to perform which tasks on the job. Currently, available data on the skill content of occupations does not capture variation across industries, geographies, or over time. Nor does it capture the applicability of a worker's current skills to new workplace tasks, an important consideration for up-skilling and re-training programs. This limitation has left a major source of information asymmetry intact in the 21st century job market, where the most effective talent search strategy remains peer-referrals. This same lack of granularity in available data has limited the effectiveness of policymakers to measure the skills-gap, identify career pathways, and design training programs most needed in their local economies. The research proposed in this project will produce an up-to-date compendium of the skills and work activities that are evolving in the labor market and map the relationships between them. This technology will provide a dynamic and granular view of the labor market and improve the quality of information available to decision-makers in industry, education, workforce development, as well as for the study of the future of work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to, through development of a Real-time Artificial Intelligence algorithm, bring expertise in endoscopic imaging interpretation to physicians taking care of patients at risk for esophageal cancer, to detect precancer earlier, and lower the cost of healthcare.  Esophageal cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers in the US with a 6 fold increase in incidence in the last 4 decades. Most endoscopists are not trained well to detect pre-cancer in the esophagus as <5% have received dedicated advanced imaging training to identify dysplasia (advanced precancer) within Barrett's Esophagus. There are well-proven minimally invasive endoscopic treatments for dysplasia and early esophageal cancer that are >95% effective in providing cure to the patient. On the other hand, when cancer is caught at a later stage the only option is removal of the esophagus with surgery in combination with expensive chemotherapy and radiation. Creating this real-time Artificial Intelligence system will assist endoscopists to detect precancer earlier, prevent this deadly cancer and expand access to esophageal cancer screening to the community at large and also to the underserved community, who typically have fewer well-trained physicians.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first system that can detect dysplasia in Barrett's Esophagus in real-time during endoscopy. This proposed research will expand on the company's preliminary work in detecting dysplastic lesions in colonoscopy and applying transfer learning methods to develop the first ever dysplasia-detection algorithm for upper endoscopy. It will initially be trained using static, annotated images, and will expand on the company's software platform to be able to eventually process video feeds, in real-time, from device makers without frame-drop or lag. The company has begun engaging with endoscopy OEMs to define metrics for success in running real-time algorithms.

    for trials, and increase the likelihood of trial success. The resulting platform
    will create a much more efficient recruitment system, as the data is shared among
    the broader research community rather than managed by any individual research
    organization. With subscriptions and fees per enrolled patient, the platform will
    be able sustain itself while at the same time lowering recruitment costs for researchers.
    More broadly, the greater ability to design and execute successful clinical trials
    will be a huge benefit to the medical community and accelerate the pace of research
    and new product development. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project seeks to improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of clinical
    trial design and recruitment. Research organizations like pharmaceutical companies
    and hospitals typically maintain isolated databases with limited, static patient
    data. This project focuses on building a third-party data platform that elegantly
    stores and organizes electronic patient data. The design of the platform enables
    ontological queries, allowing researchers to consult data when designing trials
    and quickly ?testing? specific inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine feasibility.
    When proceeding to execute the trial, the platform will rank individuals by likelihood
    to enroll, and facilitate contact with potential patients that have previously
    provide consent to be contacted. Initial objectives of the project include the
    development of a methodology to abstract patient data from medical records, and
    programming of the database structure. Later the work will focus on quality assurance
    software, and algorithms to translate free-text trial requirements into filters
    compatible with said database. The expected outcome is a platform storing accurate
    data of 200 patients, with filtering and ranking algorithms that match patients
    to trials with nearly the same accuracy of an experienced recruitment team.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be a novel wearable device for unobtrusively detecting changes in the lung health of patients with chronic respiratory disease. This Passive Unobtrusive Lung function Monitor (PULMO) will be the only device that can automatically measure a patient's lung health information without requiring any active engagement from the clinician, and without imposing any obtrusive changes to the patient's daily routine. The PULMO is useful in a broad range of respiratory disease applications, such as lung transplant post-operative care, asthma management and respiratory therapy research, that require continuous, objective and unobtrusive monitoring of lung function change. Since PULMO technology is compatible with low-cost microcontrollers, it has the potential to dominate the spirometry market and respiratory clinical trials space with high-volume production. The spirometry market has an expected CAGR of 9.4 % from 2018 to 2025, reaching a $1.4 billion market value by 2025, while clinical trials expenditures on new respiratory therapy drugs is forecast to reach $1.7 billion in 2025.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the major drawback of the state-of-the-art in continuous monitoring of respiratory disease, which is that it demands daily discipline, effort and proper technique of the patient, resulting in missing, invalid or fabricated data. In this project, a manufactured PULMO test device will be implemented with an intelligent event detection unit combined with a low power microcontroller, and the total average power consumption will be less than 300 microWatts. The measurement error of the PULMO will be within +/- 5 %, which is necessary for detecting changes in lung impairment. The intelligent event detection unit will be implemented as a nonlinear dynamical system in a custom integrated circuit. A gated recurrent neural network that is optimized for embedded low resource systems will be implemented in the low power microcontroller and will be used to detect respiratory disease symptoms. Controlled tests will be performed with a silicone phantom chest to evaluate the measurement accuracy of the PULMO device.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to drive hypertension awareness and control rates around the world, through the availability of low-cost, portable blood pressure monitoring. High blood pressure (BP) is a major cardiovascular risk factor that affects up to 1 billion people worldwide. It is treatable, yet hypertension awareness and control rates are low. Ubiquitous BP monitoring technology could improve hypertension management, but existing devices require an inflatable cuff and therefore do not afford anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The market for a portable, cuff-less blood pressure monitor is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Successful completion of this project via demonstration of measurement accuracy across a broad range of blood pressures will provide the company with a strong position in this large market. Ultimately, the success of this project could translate to much greater awareness and control of hypertension, helping reduce the incidence and burden of cardiovascular disease around the world.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a technology for cuff-less and calibration-free measurement of blood pressure via a button on a smartphone. Existing automated cuff-based monitors are bulky and do not enable anytime, anywhere measurement of BP. The 'oscillometric finger pressing method'is an emerging approach that uses the same measurement principle that is employed by most automatic cuff devices, but instead of inflating a cuff, the user presses his or her finger (and the underlying artery) against a combination of optical and pressure sensors to determine the blood pressure. The objectives of this program are to shrink the current prototype design and validate its accuracy. The proposed R&D plan includes miniaturization of the circuit components to mount them on a single board and optimization of the sensing technology and algorithm to work in a broad range of normotensive and hypertensive individuals. This work will be followed up by a clinical test of the monitor. The resulting device is expected to be small and thin enough to mount to the back of a smartphone and demonstrate clinical-grade accuracy for the measurement of blood pressure.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling efficient repeatable computing using commodity technology. While computers should, in principle, operate the same way each time, we have all seen how a program that ran fine yesterday somehow crashes today. Our current computing infrastructure betrays its fundamentally unrepeatable nature in a thousand careless ways, by letting processor and operating system details affect how programs run. Popular computing abstractions like containers and virtual machines improve repeatability, but do not provide any guarantees. This project conducts R&D on a new repeatable container, which provides repeatability for arbitrary programs running inside it. Repeatable containers will allow for reproducible software builds, software testing that runs the same on all machines, and faster software debugging with "one click" reproduction of failures. Repeatable containers reduce software development and QA costs. Repeatable containers can also facilitate archiving software and scientific research, and trustless grid computing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of new container runtime systems that can enforce repeatability with low performance overhead. This project will focus on technical improvements that yield a robust container runtime which can handle a wide range of legacy software that collectively exercises the full range of processor and operating system behaviors. The container will integrate smoothly with both existing container technologies and existing container users, to facilitate easy adoption by software developers. Key technical results will include developing a "fingerprinting" technology to uniquely identify container executions, and a stress-testing methodology to increase confidence that the repeatability guarantee holds.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving crop yields, while reducing the amount of pesticides used. By significantly improving the accuracy and timeliness of insect surveillance, we will allow more effective pest management, allowing the applications of insect interventions to be targeted in space and time. For example, rather than a blanket spraying of harsh pesticides across the entire field, our system could suggest spraying of a milder (and cheaper) pesticide in just a few "hot spots", at the optimal time of day. Reducing the volume of pesticides has further positive benefits to society at large, it will reduce pollution, and the use of pesticides has been implicated as a contributor to climate change and to colony collapse disorder. The hardware/algorithms/representations/data-models created in this project have an obvious application to mosquito surveillance, which has implications for control of insect vectored diseases of both humans and livestock. The commercial potential of this SBIR Phase I project is obvious. Insects damage or destroy about 150 billion dollars' worth of crops each year. If we prevent reduce this by just one percent, we have a billion-dollar market.

    The proposed project will investigate techniques to improve the state-of-the-art in flying insect classification, with the goal of producing a platform that allows insect surveillance for precision agriculture. In particular, we will take the current algorithms and representations (many of which were invented by the current PIs) and make them invariant to the wide range of conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity) encountered in the field. The company's research has shown that without creating such invariances, the variability induced by changing environment conditions will swamp the regularities in the features that are currently exploited by classification algorithms, and reduce the accuracy to random guessing. It is well understood how temperature, pressure, humidity effect air density, and how air density effects insect flight. However, the current models treat the insects as idealized objects using aerospace equations for density vs. lift and completely ignore the effects of the environment on insect physiology. The company plans to achieve this by creating a model that compensates for environmental conditions. To achieve these ambitious goals, they plan to use machine learning to learn the appropriate invariances and model corrections.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an enzyme immobilization platform
    to be used in the production of biopharmaceuticals and other biomanufacturing
    processes to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  Biopharmaceutical sales have soared in recent years and healthcare
    authorities have increased pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce
    the cost of biologics leaving pharmaceutical engineers to focus on reducing bioproduction
    costs.  To accomplish this goal, pharmaceutical companies are aggressively investigating
    continuous processing technologies to reduce the capital and other costs associated
    with biopharmaceutical manufacture. The immobilization platform described in this
    proposal will provide a technology that is compatible with continuous processing
    strategies to reduce the timeline and cost associated with discovering and manufacturing
    biotherapeutics.  In addition, this platform has the potential to reduce the cost
    and increase the efficiency of biomanufacturing processes across several other
    industries including food, leather, and textiles. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this SBIR Phase I project is to develop pH responsive immobilized enzymes for
    the production of biopharmaceuticals. There are three key technical challenges
    associated with this project: The immobilized-enzyme must demonstrate pH responsive
    behavior compatible with biologics manufacture (pH 6-7); mass transfer of protein
    substrates must be comparable to the native enzyme; and extended shelf-life of
    the immobilized-enzyme is required for long-term storage. To mitigate these challenges,
    this project aims to covalently bind an enzyme to a pH responsive polymer that
    is formulated to have reversible solubility near neutral pH. The solubility of
    the immobilized-biocatalyst can be tightly controlled within a specified pH range
    allowing for continuous processing and facile purification of the biotherapeutic
    product. Poor mass transfer often results from immobilizing biocatalysts on solid
    supports. These challenges are further exaggerated in bioconjugation reactions
    because the coupling partner, a protein, is generally more affected by sterics
    than small molecules. Therefore, fabrication of the solid support will be explored
    to produce resins of varied size, morphologies, and dissolution properties that
    are compatible with macromolecule functionalization. Additionally, the immobilized
    enzyme generated in this project can be utilized under soluble conditions, which
    combines the positive attributes of both immobilization and soluble enzyme catalysis.
    The final challenge of developing a commercially viable shelf-life of the catalyst
    will be addressed through development of novel drying protocols. Shelf-stable
    immobilized enzymes will be developed so that inventory can be maintained without
    requiring long lead times for catalyst production.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to transform the culture of photosynthetic aquatic microorganisms. Although microalgae and cyanobacteria have high volumetric productivities, the cultures cannot be too deep, due to restrictions of light penetration.  This proposed technology removes the light penetration limit inherent in current technologies. The results of this project will allow the production of medical and food grade biomass in controlled conditions, as the light source will not be connected to the exterior of the culture reactors. This approach will provide the advantages of a fermentation production using phototrophic species, without the need to supply organic carbon. The photosynthetic biomass production makes use of carbon dioxide and light for growth. This project will result in a microalgal/cyanobacterial biomass production in areas where it is not currently feasible and with higher productivity. The increase of the depth of the cultures two, five or more times of what is currently possible, practically reduces the area required for biomass production. A reduction of cost will improve the economic outlook for microalgal-based commodity products, including feed, food, fuels, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals and lower the environmental impact.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses one of the most significant problems found in achieving the promise of microalgae and cyanobacteria as source of food, fuels and other products is the limitation of light penetration. Most outdoor cultures are limited to less than 60 cm depth. In reactors with artificial light, besides the light penetration high electrical costs limit their use to high value products.  This project will result in a light system that takes advantage of the water movement in cultures to generate electricity for LED lights in untethered units that move with the culture. The proposed generator uses methods more efficient and lighter that traditional electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators. The developed energy harvester can be used in other applications such as power for water quality monitoring and other sensing equipment. In this phase, a unit with a miniaturized energy harvester coupled with passive switching, charging, discharging and rectifying modules in the same substrate, in a waterproof casing will be developed. Data proof of the suitability of these units to support photosynthetic microorganisms? biomass production will be obtained. The results will inform further development of the units in a future phase.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from developing technology to enable enterprise, cloud, academic, and government network operators to cost-effectively scale computer clusters to support the growing demands on these systems. Computer clusters underpin an increasingly broad range of services that businesses, researchers, and society have come to rely on, from machine learning systems to online social media platforms. Companies increasingly use computer clusters to gain a competitive advantage and accelerate product development. Today's networking technologies improve in performance by a factor of two every two years, but the demand placed on cluster computing systems is growing more than twice that fast in some market segments. The technology developed through this project is well-positioned to exceed the cost and performance scaling limitations of current networking technology, enabling business and scientific end-users to find solutions to more complex problems more quickly.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the feasibility of a network interconnect for computer clusters that routes traffic through transparent optical switches. Optical switches remove communication bottlenecks in the network fabric but require fundamental changes in how distributed applications communicate information across the network compared to present-day technologies. The commercial success of the technology depends on its ability to accelerate the execution of common distributed applications while providing the interoperability, reliability, and manageability expected by network operators. This project aims to demonstrate a 2x improvement in the execution speed of network-bound applications compared to today's technologies. The proposed research to reach this goal includes developing and optimizing the software stack necessary to interface commodity applications with the fabric, quantifying the performance of those applications subject to the constraints imposed by optical switching, and optimizing the optical switch design to maximize application performance at a system level.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop an alternative source of pharmaceutical heparin using engineered cultured mammalian cells. Heparin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant (blood thinner), critical for surgical operations and for patients that otherwise have risks of blood clotting. Over 300,000 doses are administered per year in the US alone. Currently, heparin is prepared from animal tissues, primarily pig intestines in China, which has regulatory agencies in the US and other countries concerned. For one reason, heparin manufacturing is difficult to regulate in China as evidenced by the heparin adulteration crisis in 2008 that led to allergic reactions and over 250 deaths worldwide. In addition, there is concern that the Chinese pig population will not be able to keep up with the increasing demand. The FDA is considering reintroducing heparin produced from beef cattle as an alternative source, however, bovine heparin is still subject to complications involving animal tissues and it has different anticoagulant properties, which complicates dosing. The current proposal develops cell-based production in which the entire supply chain can be under GMP control and scalable as needed with no dependence on the number and health of an animal population.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to genetically engineer cells to produce a heparin product that can be manufactured for pharmaceutical use. Cellular production can be entirely under GMP control, and cell engineering provides opportunities to produce heparin with improved properties. A survey of clinicians that use heparin overwhelmingly identified heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) as a serious detrimental side effect. HIT can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart attack and loss of life and limb. Treatment is complicated and expensive. HIT is an allergic reaction caused when heparin binds to a specific protein in the blood called platelet factor 4 (PF4). PF4 binding depends on elements of heparin structure that are not involved in heparin's anticoagulant activities. Through cell engineering, heparin molecules with an altered structure will be produced that have reduced affinities for PF4, while maintaining potent anticoagulant properties. In addition, heparin has demonstrated efficacy in other areas such as inflammation and cancer that are not involved in blood clotting. Through cell engineering, heparin structures also could be tailored for these additional applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be on any industry or product category that
    suffers from product counterfeiting; that is to say on nearly every industry imaginable.
    It is estimated that the global counterfeit market will grow from $1.2 Trillion
    in 2017 to more than $1.8 Trillion by 2020. In an attempt to combat this trend,
    spending on anticounterfeit packaging will grow from $122 Billion in 2017 to $264
    Billion by 2023. Of most dire concern, the counterfeit pharmaceutical industry
    is estimated at approximately $200 Billion, resulting in about 1 million deaths
    annually. Existing anti-counterfeit packaging techniques have proven largely ineffective
    in combating this counterfeiting problem. This project will result, for the first
    time, in packaging or seals that, without ambiguity, inform users of the authenticity,
    integrity, and provenance of any product outfitted with the project?s resultant
    technology. All stakeholders in a supply chain will be enabled to detect fake
    goods before they can be used or consumed. This increased visibility into the
    supply chain will also broaden enforcement opportunities for relevant entities
    and/or authorities and provide special benefit to those industries most urgently
    impacted: pharmaceuticals, military/defense products and high-priced goods. \n\nThe
    proposed innovation is a novel enhancement to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
    that seals any package or container to which it is attached and, when queried
    by a reader/interrogator (e.g. any modern smartphone), provides the status (i.e.
    tampered/un-tampered) and identity to the user or system. The project will produce
    the designs and manufacturing techniques required to create RFID-based seals that
    provide assurance of authenticity, integrity, and provenance for products to which
    these seals are applied. Research will be conducted on several specific hardware
    components required by this innovation and will produce the requisite software
    and cryptographic systems for the testing, design, and commercialization of this
    proposed solution to product counterfeiting. Developed software will provide the
    testing and development framework for commercial applications of the proposed
    anti-counterfeiting solution. Advances in hardware design, especially concerning
    the minimization of power requirements for the RFID-based seals and the manufacturing
    techniques for specific required hardware components (i.e. the components that
    detect tampering events) will be accomplished during this research project. Research
    and development activities will employ varied techniques including iterative design,
    3D printing, and advanced electronics prototyping. This SBIR Phase I project will
    ultimately result in the design and validation of production-ready seals.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the development of a new class of high affinity compounds that would be small enough to be delivered into challenging environments such as living cells. Inhibitors of disease-related proteins are central to modern therapeutics across the spectrum of diseases, from cancer to autoimmune diseases, to viral infections, and even to certain hereditary disorders.  Many of these drivers of disease are transcription factors or signal-transduction molecules, yet these proteins are commonly thought of as "undruggable," due to a lack of small pockets for drug binding or due to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. This proposal is aimed at developing an easily screenable library, consisting of DNA-encoded peptidomimetics, whose members have the necessary properties to inhibit these "yet-to-be-drugged" proteins.  Of highest commercial importance, these compounds could address many of the currently "undruggable" molecular drivers of diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to create a DNA-encoded library of constrained peptidomimetic compounds. Current DNA-encoded libraries are primarily limited to small molecules (DNA-encoded chemical libraries; DECLs) or to natural amino acids in the context of translated-protein display (e.g., phage display or mRNA display). In contrast, member molecules of this library will have a much larger binding surface than current small molecules from DECLs, and will be both protease resistant and have a wide range of chemical side chains, unlike the natural peptides from phage display. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to synthesize compounds with conformational rigidity along with parallel DNA encoding.  A library of these compounds could be screened to discover new therapeutic candidates (human and veterinary), life sciences research tools, and heat-resistant diagnostic reagents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    project is to make unique properties of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) widely available to
    developers. In doing so, the company will empower developers to create novel distributed services with
    trustworthy and consistent shared state operations that will lead to more transparent business
    and governance practices. In the Phase I tools will lead to new innovative meat
    distribution businesses in Bozeman, MT. In the long term, we aim to build the fundamental tools
    for the growing ranks of blockchain developers, who need powerful and easy-to-integrate tools
    that access and manipulate DLT state. Ultimately, our suite of services will provide a unified
    interface to multiple DLT implementations and facilitate the trustworthy exchange of shared
    state among different applications to create a wide and consistent view of world state.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an ecosystem of tools to operate on shared
    application state stored on DLTs and to roll out these tools as they mature. The ultimate goal is
    to provide a unified API much like that of leading cloud service providers, which consists of
    several incrementally introduced services.
    Specifically, the services planned to provide are:
    1. Blocky Valve - A JavaScript API that simplifies DLT read and write access.
    2. Blocky Pipes - A DLT data delivery microservice based on message queues connected
    to Blocky Valve.
    3. Blocky Loading Ramp - A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service
    of smart contracts.
    4. Blocky Cement - An oracle service for exchanging data across DLTs using
    consensus-based provenance. Cement will also enable interaction between smart
    contracts across different DLTs.
    5. Blocky Crates - A database-like query interface to data stored on DLTs. Crates will also
    enable smart contracts to interact with up-to-date shared application state stored on
    DLTs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop the first low-cost and integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles, facilitating deployment of next-generation electrified transportation systems. It is noteworthy that there are more than 250 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. Over 40% of greenhouse gases and 70% of emissions come from the transportation sector, and transportation is 99% dependent on one source of fuel: petroleum. Mainstream adoption of electric vehicles is essential if the U.S. is to gain energy security and substantially reduce carbon emissions. The electric car industry has passed its tipping point; however, electric vehicles are still in the very early stages of development. Like early computers, the pieces that make up an electric car are large, heavy, costly and unable to efficiently communicate amongst themselves. The proposed technology not only reduces the volume, cost, and weight of onboard chargers for electric vehicles, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation to support future Smart Grid functionalities. This project will lead to creating jobs once the technology matures toward commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to design and development of an innovative integrated and bidirectional onboard charger for electric vehicles. Currently, all the upcoming and commercially available electric vehicles are equipped with an individual onboard charger to charge traction batteries and an additional auxiliary power module to power auxiliary loads. These converters are heavy, bulky, costly and need to communicate over a variety of controller area networks. The intellectual merit of this project is in the innovative topology, design, control, development, packaging, and validation of the first charger which integrates an onboard charger and an auxiliary power module. This SBIR Phase I project involves the design of the converter, investigation and design of the controller, design and implementation of the electromagnetic interference filter stage, creating the schematics and layout, thermal management, reliability analyses, enclosure design, and final alpha prototype assembly and verification. This important work will (1) lead to theoretical advancements in the design, control, and integration of power electronic converters, (2) involve interdisciplinary research in power electronics, control, packaging, and thermal management, and (3) lead to commercialization of the first integrated onboard charger and auxiliary power module for electric vehicles.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable
    broad market adoption of rooftop and other methods for local wind energy generation
    through reduction in costs. This is achieved through development of technology
    designed to lower the cost of wind turbine drive trains and associated power electronics,
    high cost items which are often left without innovation in new wind turbine designs.
    Prohibitively high costs are currently the biggest barrier to widespread adoption
    of distributed wind turbines, and power electronics can be as much as 50% of these
    costs. Significant cost reduction has the potential to increase worldwide distributed
    wind power adoption. The innovative power train technology developed in this project
    is specifically designed to couple with a proprietary technology for wind capture
    at rooftop edges. When combined with this technology, costs estimates are competitive
    with rooftop solar energy, enabling wind energy to become a common addition to
    rooftop solar installations. Successful deployment of this technology will contribute
    to society by decreasing the carbon footprint of energy production, increasing
    energy resiliency, and creating new jobs associated with manufacturing and deployment.
    Significant manufacturing efforts are likely to remain in the US, creating local
    job opportunities and economic growth. \n\n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project proposes to use a novel drive train architecture to reduce
    small wind turbine power train costs. In this architecture, costs are lowered
    by temporarily storing the energy coming out of the wind turbine rotor in a flywheel
    before passing it on to the generator. This allows for the power train to include
    a generator and inverter that are sized for average rather than peak power outputs,
    enables removal of diversion load, and allows for the use of a faster spinning,
    and therefore lower cost generator. The Phase I project seeks to prove the feasibility
    of developing a low-cost flywheel which meets the needs of the overall drive train
    (including efficiency and reliability), a powertrain control system which maintains
    high efficiency, and a powertrain system configuration which maintains the reduced
    cost projections required for market traction. Research efforts include development
    of a bench-scale drive train to test the controls of the flywheel, powertrain
    simulation to test alternative generator and converter topologies, and benchmarking
    of generator candidates to determine efficiency and power density.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to create a cost-effective, high-performance anticorrosive coating for protecting metal structures, particularly in marine environments. High value assets that are essential parts of the US energy infrastructure, such as offshore oil and gas platforms, marine ships and wind turbines, are exposed to one of the most corrosive environments with direct exposure to salt water via immersion and seawater spray. Corrosion of these metal structures is estimated to cost the world economy around $2.3 trillion in maintenance and replacement capital every year. This project's superhydrophobic coating has the potential to significantly reduce both cost and waste by improving structural safety, reducing maintenance frequency and lengthening the operating lifetime of such vital assets. It will also reduce the environmental impact of corrosion protection systems by using less harmful materials, negating coating repainting needs and extending metal lifetime.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to make a durable, superhydrophobic, high-performance anticorrosive coating through creation of dual-function coating additives. Coatings and corrosion inhibitors are generally the first line of defense in this fight against corrosion. Highly-water repellent superhydrophobic coatings are leading contenders for delivering a step change in corrosion protection performance. However, current solutions suffer from two notable issues: high cost and low durability in highly corrosive marine environments. Existing superhydrophobic coatings require complex and expensive equipment and materials. In addition, these coatings are easily damaged during use, resulting in the loss of their water repellency and corrosion protection ability. The key innovation of this project is a novel dual-function additive that can impart coatings with both superhydrophobicity (passive corrosion protection) and on-demand corrosion inhibitors release (active corrosion protection). This additive based approach results in a durable coating that retains its protective abilities even through significant use and abrasion and enables adaptation to many other coating applications, even ones outside of corrosion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in contributing towards the global effort in minimizing food spoilage and combating world hunger. The worldwide cold-chain freight and logistics industry deals with the storage and transportation of more than 100 million metric tons of fresh produce annually. In this industry, there is currently an urgent need to continuously monitor the air quality in shipping containers where large volumes of perishable food items (fresh fruits and vegetables) are stored. Poor environmental conditions in these containers such as unregulated or high temperatures and low humidity can trigger early ripening of fruits and vegetables, leading to the efflux of specific volatile organic compounds; predominantly ethylene. Due to large volume of produce stored in these containers, if gone unchecked, the environment inside can quickly accumulate high levels of ethylene leading to accelerated ageing and subsequently spoilage. As one can imagine, an appropriate gas sensing technology to continuously monitor ethylene levels would allow adaptive climate control inside the containers, thereby ensuring produce freshness on arrival and preventing billions of dollars in loss and reducing food waste.

    This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop a low-cost ethylene sensing technology using bulk silicon transistor technology (also called CS-FET or chemical sensitive field effect transistor), for mass-deployment in refrigerated containers transporting fresh produce to different parts of the world. This innovation will address an unmet need in the cold-chain logistics industry where continuous monitoring of fruits and vegetables is required to ensure quality and freshness on-arrival. Existing technologies are either too expensive or have poor sensitivity for deployment in large-scale sensing operations. Specifically, Phase I seeks to identify and engineer a sensitive nanoscale catalyst/sensing-layer that will respond to ethylene. To develop the ethylene sensing layers, this effort will pursue the screening of various nanomaterial systems such as ultra-thin layers of noble and transition metals, their composites, sub-oxides, as well as polymeric films using the silicon CS-FET as the backbone technology platform. Additionally, the proposal will also seek to develop a scientific understanding of the interaction mechanism between ethylene and the target sensing layer at both standard ambient conditions as well as conditions prevalent in reefer containers, i.e. low temperature and high humidity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will benefit manufacturers of residual gas analyzers, mass spectrometers, ion-mobility spectrometers, time-of-flight spectrometers and related instruments. Implementation of these sensors will increase the revenue, revenue streams and market share of commercial manufacturers of mass spectrometers by significantly lowering production cost, and by enabling penetration into new markets that require increased sensitivity, lowered size, weight, power consumption, and instrument complexity. The product, if successful, will lead to analytical tools that can substantially benefit the needs of education/research, space, bio/health, agricultural, defense and security markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop nanotechnology-based chip-scale ion sensors with ultra-high intrinsic charge-to-current amplification factors. This patent-pending technology allows semiconductor-processable miniaturization and scalability, sub-microwatt intrinsic power draw, and robust ambient-pressure-agnostic operation. With reduced size, weight, and power requirements, increased sensitivity and dynamic range, these sensors can potentially replace expensive, bulky, and/or high-power-consuming charged particle detectors such as microchannel plates, Daly detectors, electron-multiplier tubes and Faraday cups. The ability to operate under any ambient pressure and distinguish charge polarity can significantly enhance field-portability, turnkey operations, and enhance analytical reach of ion-sensing-based applications. Specifically, the proposed research will seek to overcome the challenges related to generation of high signal responses (by enhancing the electronic transport parameters), high ion-sensor interaction (by optimizing sensor design), and lower readout noise (by optimizing materials and design).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the adoption of AI features in Internet of Things and mobile devices.  The proposed multi-bit non-volatile memory (NVM) based Deep Neural Networks (DNN) IP is based on the standard CMOS logic processes. Existing solution for the DNN hardware typically requires off-chip access to retrieve neural network parameters from external memories, incurring additional communication latency and power consumption. Additionally, when critical neural network parameters are transmitted off-chip, security or privacy concern may arise, which is unacceptable especially for the applications such as personalized AI devices. Alternative approach integrating the DNN engine in a special NVM process requires as much as 10 additional masks beyond the conventional logic CMOS process which is not cost-effective for medium density DNN engine in cost-sensitive edge devices. With this proposed IP, any existing or new system on chip requiring persistent AI functionality can be built quickly and cost effectively.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a cost-effective non-volatile neural network accelerator IP for edge devices. To solve the security, latency, power consumption, and cost issues associated with the traditional approaches, a single-poly based low cost, non-volatile, multi-bit eFlash cell is proposed. Multi-bit cell operation however presents significant challenges due to inherent reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. Key technical hurdles include solving disturbances of unselected cells, improving sensing margin, and overcoming reliability issues associated with high voltage operation in readout circuits as well as developing robust neural network cell arrays. To address these challenges, several new ideas related to multi-bit cell, high-voltage circuits, and cell programming methods have been proposed. Once verified successfully in this project, the multi-bit cell IP can then be integrated as logic compatible non-volatile memory to store neural network parameters on-chip, or as logic compatible non-volatile neural network IP to execute entire neural network operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that enabling processing thin glass substrates for next generation communications and packaging needs will mean faster communications with improved power efficiency.  Society has an ever-expanding need for data, due to technologies such as mobile communications, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the shift of communication to higher frequencies (1s-10s of GHz).  As the frequency increases, traditional material choices, such as silicon, can experience very high losses and therefore there is increasing interest in using insulating materials, such as glass, to improve power efficiency.  Similarly, as device size is also important, ability to process thin materials is also critical.  Successful completion of this work will enable cost-effective processing of thin glass substrates and enable next generation communication initiatives impacting commercial, military and industrial markets.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is proposed to enable processing thin glass substrates in high volume environments.  There has been substantial interest in using glass for next generation RF and packaging solutions for many years due to its advantageous material properties, and scalability.  Of particular interest is the dielectric properties, which provide low electrical loss solutions relative to incumbent materials such as silicon.  Furthermore, the smoothness, hermetic properties and scalability of glass provides additional advantages over materials such as ceramics and organic laminates.  There has been a lot of progress in establishing processes to form thin glass and make precision through glass vias (TGV), as well as demonstrating advantaged functional performance in a lab environment.  There has been a challenge to establish the ability to scale to high volume for thin glass solutions due to gaps in the supply chain.  This SBIR project will establish a process that enables a carrier solution using a silicon carrier that will allow processing of glass in existing infrastructure making thin glass solutions available to the current well established and capable supply chain.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve high-risk pregnancy care and preterm
    labor detection by developing a noninvasive, low-cost, point-of-care wearable

    Each year, 4 million women give birth in the US. More than one in ten of pregnancies
    is considered high-risk, where the mother, fetus, or newborn has elevated risk
    of experiencing an adverse health condition. The proposed platform will allow
    doctors to remotely monitor and manage high-risk pregnancies and intervene, as
    needed, upon detection of labor or other potential complications. By enhancing
    early detection of fetal well-being and increasing access to care, the device
    will allow for improved healthcare delivery, thus increasing mother and infant
    safety, preventing maternal and neonatal morbidities, and lowering healthcare
    costs. By applying machine learning to what could become the largest and most
    comprehensive dataset on maternal and fetal health, the proposed platform could
    become a valuable resource to researchers to identify underlying causes and biomarkers
    of preterm birth. Primary end users are women with high-risk pregnancies, and
    elevated risk of preterm birth. Target customers are hospitals, health care providers
    and insurance companies. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project seeks to develop an unprecedented means to support advances in maternal
    and fetal health: a state-of-the-art miniaturized mobile monitor that discretely
    sticks onto the mother's abdomen and uses sensors to noninvasively monitor fetal
    heart rate (FHR) and other physiological parameters in home and clinical environments.
    The device communicates to a smartphone, which acts as gateway to send data to
    a cloud-based platform, where the data is collected, stored and analyzed, with
    doctors able to set notification thresholds. For this project, patch technology,
    proven to effectively measure uterine activity and fetal movement will be leveraged
    to develop a disruptive product capable of detecting FHR as early as 25 weeks
    gestation. Miniaturization, power consumption and cost levels necessary for deployment
    in remote settings will be achieved. A usability study of the prototype monitor
    will then be conducted in expectant women in hospital settings, followed by an
    equivalency study to validate accuracy of the prototype compared to cardiotocogram,
    the current clinical gold standard. This solution will increase specificity of
    FHR testing, and improve interpretation of monitoring data, as well as aggregate
    data to train AI models to predict adverse events such as preterm birth.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to improve security of cloud computing without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. Cloud computing has proven to be a disruptive technology in the Information Technology (IT) sector, and the application container market is a rapidly growing segment of this sector. Although containers provide a simpler and more efficient apparatus to host applications in the cloud, there are important problems to address, such as weak security isolation, low kernel compatibility, and poor kernel customization. Security is the most common concern because one infected kernel can affect a multitude of containers. So far, each organization that has adopted container applications has been required to independently ensure their own security. One study found that a majority (54% of participants) ran containers on top of virtual machines (VMs) for security isolation, which sacrifices performance and cost efficiency. Thus, there is a significant need to provide a container architecture that supports greater security without sacrificing performance and cost efficiency. This project addresses this urgent need, and the resulting technology can be applied broadly to domains such as cloud computing, Information Technology (IT) infrastructures, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), etc.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will further improve usability, security, and efficiency of a novel software application container architecture, so that it can be easily deployed and evaluated by customers. While the current platform can run Docker containers without modifications, it is incompatible with the Docker and Kubernetes orchestration platforms, which is a probable obstacle to adoption for many container users and developers. The novel containers can run unmodified iterations of existing applications and automatically optimize performance of many applications by patching the binary during runtime. However, it is challenging to handle complicated scenarios in the application binary, and a more sophisticated technique is required to further improve the coverage of the automatic binary optimization module. Due to the licensing requirements of some of the software the novel container platform is based on, the research prototype is run open-source. The goal of this project is to address these limitations and challenges through five major objectives: support Docker and Kubernetes ecosystem compatibility; improve automatic binary optimization coverage; re-design the platform to avoid open-source license violations; further improve security; develop an automatic installation tool and a product demonstration.

    This SBIR Phase I project will help to address a critical need for patients who have suffered an infection in a total knee replacement joint.  Unfortunately, doctors have few good options for effectively treating this type of infection to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should the infection persist and spread.  Today, treatment requires surgical replacement of part or all of the existing implant while using oral or intravenous antibiotics.  Due to the capsule around the joint (isolated from blood vessels) these methods deliver marginal amounts of antibiotic within the knee where the bacteria reside.  Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without the use of their knee, waiting for the bacterial infection to slowly resolve.   ForCast Orthopedics' Antibiotic Dispensing Knee Spacer provides a refillable reservoir within the artificial knee that can distribute antibiotic directly into the knee capsule for effective infection treatment.  Physicians can prescribe the antibiotic most appropriate for the bacteria diagnosed.  The patient returns to the doctor's office once per week for a checkup and antibiotic refill injection until the infection is cured.  No follow up surgery is required. Duplicating the antibiotic delivery of previous successful clinical studies (using representative but intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced patient suffering and reduced healthcare costs.

    This SBIR Phase I project addresses an underserved clinical need for improved treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI).  Today, doctors have few good options for treatment to avoid the potential for limb amputation or even death should PJI persist and spread.  All methods require surgical debridement and replacement of part or all of the existing implant (to reduce bacterial load) while using oral or intravenous antibiotics that cannot reach the remaining bacteria within the knee capsule (blood/synovial fluid barrier). Temporary eluting antibiotic spacers and beads are too short lived. Patients suffer elongated treatment, many times without a load-bearing knee.  ForCast Orthopedics is developing an Antibiotic Dispensing Spacer (AD Spacer) to replace the standard spacer in a total knee implant.  The AD Spacer provides a refillable reservoir to hold the antibiotic of choice for the bacteria identified and a delivery system to maintain a therapeutic concentration within the knee for the entire therapy duration, typically a minimum of 6 weeks. As a permanent spacer, no further surgery is required after treatment.  Emulating the delivery characteristics of previously successful clinical studies (using intolerable daily injections) should result in similar highly successful patient outcomes, reduced morbidity and reduced total cost of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project affects one of the most critical problems facing the United States agricultural industry, a shortage of available labor.   This shortage has had a particularly pronounced effect on the fruit and vegetable industry, where even a brief loss of labor can result in a total loss of harvestable products.  More recently, U.S. produce suppliers have been forced to rely heavily on imported produce sourced from greater distances and of lower quality.  Advancements in agricultural technology have already dramatically improved the efficiency of produce farms in terms of land utilization and water consumption by enabling produce to be grown indoors using highly sophisticated commercial greenhouses, automated nutrient delivery, and light control.  However, to date, these commercial greenhouses still lack a comprehensive solution for automating routine harvesting, pruning, and crop care labor tasks.  Thus, newly developed agricultural technologies which can automate these tasks have the potential for substantial commercial impact by making domestic farming operations more profitable and efficient.  Commercial adoption of automated harvesting technology will also benefit consumers by enabling higher quality produce grown closer to market and position the U.S. agricultural sector as a new area of growth for highly skilled technical jobs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of new deep learning techniques used to identify harvestable fruits (initially tomatoes) using computer vision cameras and to accurately estimate their orientation and connectivity (bunches of fruits that are connected by the same stem or vine).  Successful development of a method capable of running in real-time would resolve substantial technical risks which inhibit the ability to commercialize robotic automated harvesting solutions.  Such advancements would also contribute newfound insights to the broader computer vision and robotic manipulation communities into the unique challenges that sparse and deformable ?vine? like structures present to traditional methods of object pose estimation and grasping.  In the later portion of this Phase I project, Root AI will incorporate these new methods of sensing tomato fruit orientation into an improved motion and task planning system which uses the additional information to intelligently plan a complex movement path to harvest individual fruits in congested and heavily occluded natural growing environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a single beam ion source that enables the manufacturing of high-quality thin film materials and related products. Thin films have a significant impact on quality of life as they are used widely in semiconductor devices, displays, solar panels, tribological coatings, cell phones, optical filters, and micro-electro-mechanical systems. The annual market of these industry segments exceeds $600 billion and has been steadily increasing. Common methods to produce thin films include physical and chemical vapor depositions, which today have tradeoffs between film quality and manufacturability. A high deposition rate results in loosely packed atoms and subsequently unstable materials properties. Producing high-quality dense films today requires slow deposition at elevated temperatures leading to high manufacturing cost and other limitations, such as inability to use flexible substrates. Ion sources are plasma generation devices that enable ion beams to interact with materials at the atomic level and efficiently produce dense films. The single beam ion sources bring in multiple benefits for thin film fabrication, including superior stability, improved adhesion, low electrical resistivity, high optical transmittance, and smooth surfaces.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will validate the technical and commercial feasibilities of the single beam ion sources particularly suitable for fabricating high-quality thin films and devices. In ion beam assisted thin-film deposition, ions simultaneously interact with the atoms as they are deposited from another source. The ions transfer kinetic energies to the surface atoms so that they can move around to form densely packed films. The single beam ion sources proposed in this project can produce a highly focused beam of ions with tunable energy for optimal processing of the growing films. These unique features are enabled by an innovative design of the electromagnetic fields, which efficiently generate plasmas and extract the ions in a narrow beam. Unlike the conventional racetrack type ion sources, the single beam ion sources can accurately control the ion incident angle, which has strong effects on the surface morphology of the deposited film.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to develop a widely applicable, innovative pipeline for drug discovery against rare genetic disorders. While each orphan disease affects a small fraction of individuals, thousands exist, affecting 400 million people world-wide. The challenge to bring therapies to the clinics for diseases that currently have no cure, which is coupled with an expanding market.  Orphan drug sales are expected to reach $262 billion in 2024.  Over the last few years, organoids made from human embryonic stem cells have raised the possibility of understanding the mechanisms leading to a genetic disorder by reconstituting, in vitro, a similar arrangement of the specific cell populations that are implicated in a certain disease. By comparing organoids made from healthy cells to those carrying the associated genetic mutation, drug testing may be performed in vitro to discover new therapeutics. However, this potential has not been harnessed due to technical limitations. In this proposal, as a necessary step towards this goal, the plan is to develop the analytical tools based on machine learning algorithms that will allow the analysis of drug therapeutic potential and toxicity when applied to organoid cultures.

    The intellectual merit of this STTR Phase I project is to develop and validate an unbiased analytical scheme to quantify the results of high-throughput phenotypic screens performed on micropattern organoids. Organoids have the potential to revolutionize the pre-clinical part of the drug discovery pipeline as they provide unbiased endpoints, they are disease relevant, and sensitive to toxicity. However, the use of multi-cellular organization in a high-throughput platform requires analysis of large amounts of information-rich microscopy images. The tools developed in this proposal will allow turning the biological complexity of tissue scale phenotypes into information predictive of the clinical potential of a compound. In the first aim, the goal is to demonstrate that the proposed method allows quantifying compound toxicity. The plan is to calibrate the toolbox against known methods quantifying cell viability, applying known toxic agents and withdrawn drugs. This will constitute a stringent test for the efficiency of the proposed method at quantifying deleterious effects of a compound. Second, the goal is to optimize the algorithm to measure therapeutic potential, using positive controls on micropattern-based organoids modeling Huntington's Disease (HD). The objective is to demonstrate the ability to analyze results of a screening campaign aimed at phenotypic reversal on the HD organoids, and detect hit molecules from a small library of FDA-approved drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to create an abuse-free and ad-free social network based on principles of affirmative consent using a novel hybrid human-machine moderation technology. Harassment and abuse plague current social platforms. This abuse is particularly directed towards women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community, who are most vulnerable to these types of attacks. These demographics around the world need a harassment-free social network platform to communicate and share content and would be willing to pay a subscription fee. In addition, independent "new media" content creators also need an advertising-free and harassment-free platform to build an audience, interact with followers or fans, control access to paid content, and receive payment for their work. Users who have fled other platforms due to harassment, data mining, or personal privacy concerns may also want friendly and safe spaces to interact and share content. In addition to subscription fees, this novel moderation technology has the potential to be offered as a service to other social network businesses.

    This Small Business Innovation Research SBIR Phase I project takes a novel consent-based approach to social network moderation. The project combines data from multiple sources, including machine learning models, in order to give users more control over the content they wish to see and prevent harassment and abuse. By supplementing automated approaches with human ones, and putting users in control of which sources of moderation content and metadata to trust, this innovation will reduce the labor required for human moderation and the accuracy of machine approaches, all while making relatively strong guarantees that the most vulnerable users will not be exposed to abuse or harassment.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to develop a microfluidic device for cell therapy manufacturing. Advantages in terms of cost and quality of the cell products produced by the proposed technology should benefit clinical researchers and cell therapeutics. Further, by providing an efficient, standardized, and scalable approach to the manufacturing process, the translation of lab-scale discoveries to curative therapies that are widely-available should be significantly accelerated.  On a fundamental level, this project will enhance technological understanding of how to apply microfluidic technology concepts to clinically-relevant applications (requiring macroscopic flowrates) in a practical manner, while also establishing a new medical device sector centered on a suite of easily implemented cell separation devices for use in cellular therapies and related fields.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to employ a cell separation approach to create a high-throughput proof-of-concept prototype to help simplify and streamline the manufacture of cellular therapies.  To accomplish this objective, a two-stage microfluidic module will be designed to achieve isolation of separate lymphocyte- and monocyte-rich subpopulations from blood samples, while removing undesirable red blood cells and platelets, at levels sufficient for successful culture growth.  In addition, the plan is to fabricate a full-scale prototype system of parallelized lymphocyte/monocyte isolation modules to achieve a volumetric throughput capable of processing 200mL of peripheral blood-, buffy coat-, or mononuclear cell (MNC) leukapheresis-derived product within ~30 minutes.  Once developed, this technology will overcome many drawbacks that plague current cell isolation approaches including high per unit cost, laborious/time-consuming workflow, and potential to compromise sterility. This device will require no expensive or complex equipment on-site to drive the separation/concentration of the cells of interest.

    This SBIR Phase I project examines the feasibility of using magnetic sensors based on Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) for neurological imaging. Information about brain activity is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of disorders including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. The most powerful non-invasive technique for measuring brain activity, magnetoencephalography (MEG), uses magnetometers that require liquid helium cooling and magnetic shielding to operate. Due to these requirements, current MEG systems are large and expensive, limiting their adoption and accessibility. ADFMR sensors could allow for the measurement of biomagnetic fields without the need for cryogenics and magnetic shielding, dramatically reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of such systems. The portability of this improved technology would allow for functional neuroimaging outside of the carefully controlled imaging suites where it is possible today. This could allow for diagnosis of previously unreachable patients (ie. in the ICU, operating room, or ambulance) as well as the development of new uses for this technology (ie. long-term monitoring, scanning during movement). This improved, portable MEG could also enable the first practical, portable brain-computer interface ? applicable across a wide variety of applications in both defense and consumer sectors.

    This SBIR Phase I project investigates the ability for ADFMR sensors to measure extremely small magnetic fields, such as those generated by the human brain. The ADFMR phenomenon has been shown to be a much more power and size efficient alternative to traditional methods of exciting ferromagnetic resonance, allowing for its use as a sensing mechanism for chip-scale magnetometers. In the proposed program, a number of methods to improve the performance of current ADFMR devices will be investigated. First, a compact model will be developed to allow for fast modeling of ADFMR devices and their associated detection circuitry. Using the results of this model, devices will be fabricated in order to experimentally validate various mechanisms for the reduction of 1/f noise in the detector circuitry and for the optimization of the ADFMR absorption profile for maximum sensitivity to applied magnetic fields. These sensor elements will initially be tested using standard benchtop characterization equipment. Following a benchtop demonstration, challenges in miniaturizing the full sensor system will be addressed by developing fully integrated magnetometer prototypes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the injection molding industry which generates over $100 billion in revenue in the US alone. The proposed multivariate shrinkage sensor promises a leap forward from the current use of in-mold pressure/temperature sensors for indirect estimation of molded part dimensions and quality. Direct measurement of the shrinkage along with pressure and temperature in situ from the proposed sensor will enable improved process and quality control methods for injection molding which will eliminate the burden of frequent post-molding inspections and allow fully automated manufacturing. As a result, over 30 % of manufacturing cost and time will be saved while achieving 100% quality assurance even for the parts with tighter specifications. The proposed sensor will help heavily regulated industries such as medical devices and automobile manufacturing in achieving significant time reduction for process set-up and stabilization, and improvement in parts quality while meeting stringent regulatory requirements. Each percentage point improvement in productivity due to cycle time reductions, yield improvements, and related automation corresponds to cost savings of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and recycling of defective plastic parts.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a creative and original concept: a multivariate design for measuring shrinkage along with pressure and temperatures via a conventionally packaged device. Furthermore, knowledge and understanding are expected to be advanced in the development and validation of improved on-line models for estimating molded part shrinkage in real-time. Previous research did not have access to in-mold shrinkage data and so propagated faulty initial conditions throughout the shrinkage analysis. Due to the lack of direct observability and controllability of the molded part dimensions, most molders rely on the use of cavity pressure traces or part weight measurements as estimators of the part dimensions. However, there still is no technology or research available to monitor and predict the shrinkage on-line during production to improve, to optimize and to control parts quality and processing parameters without using expensive instrumentation. The outcome of this Phase I project will fill this gap and develop a fully functional multivariate shrinkage sensor which will enable measurement of molded product dimensions in situ prior to ejection from the mold.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).  Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as one of the best tools to catalogue cell types and understand their function.  The key advantage of scRNA-seq is that it provides transcriptome-wide information about individual cells in heterogeneous samples while alternative methods either provide information about only a limited set of genes (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR) or cannot provide single-cell resolution (bulk RNA-seq, microarrays).  However, current scRNA-seq approaches remain expensive, enable only limited sample multiplexing, and are not compatible with common sample storage conditions. This project will focus on the key technical challenges that are required to develop universally applicable scRNA-seq kits that meet customer needs. If successful, the end product will be a scRNA-seq kit that is ready for pilot testing with academic and pharmaceutical company customers. By reducing the cost and increasing sample size and sample multiplexing of scRNA-seq, the technology will improve the ability to understand multicellular systems and enhance workflows used in the pharmaceutical industry, such as drug screening and patient stratification.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR  Phase I project is to develop a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method by using a combinatorial barcoding scheme that labels transcripts within fixed cells.  The proposed technology makes it possible to measure the transcriptional profiles of hundreds of thousands of individual cells in parallel. Unlike previous scRNA-seq technologies, the technology also enables high sample multiplexing (up to 96 samples/experiment), is compatible with stored samples, and fixes cells before dissociation, reducing the risk of perturbations to gene expression during cell handling. Most importantly, the method requires no complex instruments, which contributes to making the technology an order of magnitude less expensive than existing technologies. The objectives of this project are to dramatically improve the number of molecules detected per cell and to simplify the workflow for users. Modifications to assay chemistry will be tested to increase molecular detection, and time-consuming steps in the workflow will be altered to shorten the overall experimental time and reduce the probability of user error.

    This SBIR Phase I project is dedicated to building a scalable project-based learning education technology platform. The technology in this project is based on a chatbot that sustains ongoing, interdisciplinary conversations with each student. The platform is designed to provide middle school students with curriculum materials that expose them to authentic and engaging real-world problems that, over the course of weeks or months, come together to form a cohesive response to a project prompt. The goal of this project is to build and refine this new form of eLearning platform that has the potential to greatly improve engagement and learning outcomes, especially for low-income and minority students. This goal will be achieved by making the standards-aligned educational content meaningful and relevant to the interests of students and by catering the instructional materials to each individual student's skill level so they can move through the materials at their own pace towards mastery. To measure the impact of this technology on student outcomes, this project will involve state-of-the-art efficacy research in accordance with guidelines in the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).


    This SBIR Phase I project is concerned with developing a forward-looking education platform built around a chatbot that sustains long term, goals-oriented conversations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and based on a decision tree architecture. The highly-customized chatbot is designed to make project-based learning scalable by empowering students to choose and customize their own project theme from a set of options, and then providing conversational explanations and practice questions that illustrate how Common Core standards apply to the student?s project. This research undertaking will involve developing and training custom neural networks to interpret student responses and questions. It will also involve developing algorithms that correctly identify each student's level of reading comprehension and, independently, conceptual understanding. With an understanding of the student's level, another algorithm will be developed that selects the appropriate materials and resources at the student?s reading comprehension level. These algorithms will be refined through user testing and a preliminary study of the efficacy of this education intervention will be tested in a correlational study with statistical controls.

    Learning'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop technology using engineered bacteria
    to improve protein stability in two large markets: therapeutic proteins and industrial
    enzymes. Proteins used as therapeutics frequently have insufficient half-lives
    in human blood plasma, so that patients with chronic disease need to receive frequent
    dosings, often by painful injections. These burdensome dosing schedules result
    in high rates of patient noncompliance, with attendant poor responses and negative
    health outcomes. Therapeutic proteins with improved half-lives in blood plasma
    would permit relaxed dosing schedules, lowering costs of administration and improving
    outcomes by reducing noncompliance. This proposed technology focuses on improving
    the plasma half-life of a therapeutic for a chronic disease primarily affecting
    children that currently comprises a $4B global market. Similarly, industrial enzymes
    are frequently deployed in harsh environments that impair enzyme stability and
    activity. Endowing enzymes with improved resistance to destabilizing chemicals
    would enable their deployment in high-value environments that are currently prohibitive.
    The proposed technology will be used to stabilize an enzyme for application in
    a $730M segment of the personalized medicine market. If successful, this work
    would provide a platform for developing next-generation enzymes deployable in
    currently prohibitive environments. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase
    I project is to utilize a synthetic biology platform to create proteins with new
    amino acid building blocks that dramatically improve half-life and stability.
    Many proteins used as therapeutics or used as industrial enzymes are stabilized
    by disulfide bonds. These bonds break in the presence of chemicals called reducing
    agents that are found both in human blood plasma (destabilizing to therapeutics)
    and in solvents and buffers (destabilizing to industrial enzymes). Using a strain
    of engineered E. coli that can incorporate amino acids beyond the 20 standard
    amino acids into proteins, the goal is to replace disulfide-forming cysteine amino
    acids with selenocysteine amino acids that form bonds called diselenides. Diselenide-stabilized
    proteins maintain stability and activity in environments with reducing agents
    incompatible with disulfide-stabilized proteins. This project will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    protein therapeutic for a major disease class. Improvements to disulfide-stabilized
    therapeutics will be demonstrated by ELISA assays showing improved binding activity,
    and by cell-based assays showing improved therapeutic activity, after prolonged
    exposure to blood plasma. This project also will produce a diselenide-stabilized
    industrial enzyme to catalyze a critical reaction for personalized medicine. Performance
    improvements over disulfide-stabilized enzymes will be demonstrated by in vitro
    stability and activity assays in reducing conditions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to bring curative gene editing therapies using CRISPR to patients with genetic diseases. CRISPR-based therapeutics have the potential to be next generation therapeutics, particularly for genetic diseases due to their ability to cut DNA with sequence specificity. However, this type of targeted genome editing has not yet been successfully demonstrated for human therapeutics with existing methods.  The translation of CRISPR-based gene editing to the clinic remains a significant unmet need and the most difficult aspect of translating CRISPR-based gene editing into therapeutics is the lack of safe and effective delivery methods to the target the tissues. Existing viral-based delivery systems have limitations that include immunogenicity, pre-existing antibodies against them, broad tropism, off-target effects, restricted DNA cargo packaging capacity, and manufacturing challenges. As a result, non-viral methods that employ synthetic materials are being widely investigated as potential alternatives. Developing non-viral delivery vehicles that can effectively deliver CRISPR components to target tissues will improve the ability to broadly use CRISPR-based therapeutics for many genetic diseases.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a non-viral delivery system for the CRISPR enzyme Cas 12a (Cpf1) for delivery to target muscle tissue, and, potentially, enable the development of a novel gene editing treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The approach involves proprietary CRISPR-nanoparticles that are composed of peptide PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP, which possess good biocompatibility and high gene editing efficiency with the potential to manufacture and scale up under GMP for use in clinical trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that PEG-PAsp(DET) complexed to Cpf1 RNP can efficiently deliver Cpf1 RNP to the muscle tissue and can induce the expression of the dystrophin protein by deleting exon23 with a mutation. Under this proposal, the specific experiments will focus on improving the biocompatibility, stability, and muscle-targeting ability of the CRISPR-nanoparticles. The experimental plan is to synthesize various Peptide-PEG-PAsp(DET), followed by screening in primary myoblasts and reporter mouse system. This technology using CRISPR-nanoparticles will be the first example of a delivery vehicle that can simultaneously deliver Cpf1 protein and gRNA via intravenous injection and achieve gene editing.

    a novel vaccine technology to diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)
    vaccine to produce a thermostable and orally administered formulation. Vaccines
    are one of the best investments in global public health and are estimated to save
    2-3 million lives per year and protect more than 100 million lives from illness
    and disability. This project proposes to use a novel vaccine technology platform
    that targets immune cells in the intestine, enducing a broad immune response,
    and retains stability at room temperature. This technology has the potential to
    minimize dependence on the cold-chain and trained medical professionals to administer
    the vaccine, which are barriers to full vaccine coverage. Additionally, it has
    potential to increase uptake of vaccine booster doses for adults, with convenience
    of self-administration and reduced anxiety with no needles. Finally, successful
    formulation of an oral DTaP vaccine would open the doors to other antigens to
    be delivered orally. This technology can significantly improve national health,
    which is one of the missions of NSF. Additionally, switching vaccines to thermostable,
    oral delivery form is very cost-effective and will alleviate the burden and cost
    of cold-chain and professional to administer the vaccines. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project will test the application of a novel delivery technology to the DTaP
    vaccine. The highly innovative delivery platform consists of a novel adjuvant,
    a C-type lectin (CTL) receptor ligand with aluminum hydroxide that targets mucosal
    immune cells for a strong synergistic boosting of broad immune response, and microencapsulation
    of the vaccine to resist the strong acidic environment of the stomach. This technology
    can be incorporated into existing or new vaccines enhancing stability and allowing
    oral delivery. The first goal of this project includes incorporation of CTL receptor
    ligand to the DTaP vaccine and applying enteric microencapsulation to the particles
    to protect the vaccine from low pH. Extensive testing and experiments will be
    conducted to obtain the optimal formulation of the final oral vaccine. The second
    goal will be to test and compare the potency of the newly formulated vaccine with
    a commercially available DTaP vaccine in mice. The final goal will be to test
    and compare the stability of both vaccines at high temperatures. Successful completion
    of all objectives will provide a great base for commercial feasibility of the
    technology. This technology has the potential to be incorporated on any vaccine
    that can benefit from a thermostable and orally delivery platform.\n\nThis award

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel seed treatment technology
    for plants, based on small naturally occurring molecules proven to activate natural
    defenses against a wide range of agriculturally important pathogens. The proposed
    innovation as a plant protectant is active at very low concentrations (nM range),
    can be readily synthesized in large quantities, and is biodegradable and non-toxic.
    To feed a projected world population of over 9 billion people in 2050, innovation
    will be required at all stages of crop production and distribution. Annual application
    of more than 600 different chemical pesticides (500 million Kg) costs $10 billion,
    and yet 37% of all crops are still destroyed by pests (insects 13%, pathogens
    12%, weeds 12%). By providing an alternative, effective method for managing transmissible
    diseases in major crops, dependence on existing agrochemicals such as copper,
    synthetic fungicides and antibiotics will be reduced, as will the rate of resistance
    development. The goal is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability
    of agriculture by reducing the use of potentially harmful pesticides, and significantly
    enhance food security worldwide. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this SBIR project
    is to develop a novel control for plant pathogens by leveraging a class of small,

    These small molecules are recognized by plants at extremely low concentrations,
    and their perception has been demonstrated to result in defense responses and
    enhanced resistance to viral, bacterial, oomycete, and fungal pathogens, in Arabidopsis,
    tomato, potato, barley, and wheat. In order to bring the innovation to market
    in the form of a commercial seed treatment, the following must be demonstrated:
    a seed-coating formulation capable of long-term stability and efficacy, without
    adverse effect on seed germination or natural microbe/insect populations. The
    focus of the proposed Phase I project will be to optimize synthesis of the compound
    of interest and develop a stable, commercially viable formulation that is effective
    across a breadth of crops. Following initial validation, product testing will
    advance to in vivo efficacy testing in greenhouse and field trials. The seed treatment
    product developed will establish the technical and economic feasibility of using
    small-molecule signals to activate plant immune responses, and demonstrate their
    utility to improve economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce a digital + physical game for 6-10 year olds that fosters computational thinking practices through collaboration, listening, and tinkering through play with music. It is widely recognized that to be ready for the future, today?s students need to develop the ability to think critically, identify and solve complex problems, communicate clearly about their thinking, and work collaboratively with a team. Computational thinking (CT) is the core of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and is about developing a set of problem-solving heuristics, approaches and habits of mind. Collaboration and creativity, now seen as cross-cutting 21st Century skills, are also viewed as CT practices. Not all learners are motivated to learn CT through traditional programming contexts, even those designed for young learners. Moreover, there are a lack of learning environments to engage children in tinkering--trying things out and debugging--finding out why things didn?t happen as expected. And, the vast majority of existing CT learning environments for young children do not explicitly support the development of positive attitudes towards problem solving, confidence in dealing with complexity, and communicating and collaborating with others to achieve a goal. This product will enhance students? grasp of collaborative problem solving and ultimately computational thinking by engaging them in fundamental concepts that unite computing and music.


    The core technical innovation of this project is the design and development methodology that will lead to the creation of a transformative learning platform in its approach to learning outcomes, collaborative problem solving, and engaging game play. This multi-user, multi-device experience relies on a new approach to collaborative problem solving, leveraging multiple user inputs responsive to group tinkering and debugging. Players must employ critical listening, tinkering, debugging, and communication to identify pieces of music that are off, and work collaboratively to adjust controllers to get the music back to its original state. This game not only requires problem solving across scales (debugging smaller parts of the puzzle to get to an overall solution) but also requires collaboration and communication, something largely missing in educational games for children. This phase will focus on the build of the digital component of the game as well as conduct research and development around physical controllers. Additionally, this phase of development will research the balance of visual, audio and haptic feedback mechanisms to help players through frustrating moments, foster player communication and collaboration, and test visual design for the most effective feedback.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop educational technologies to better train university students to innovate. To become innovators, students must gain practice solving real-world problems, such as reducing hospital acquired infections, narrowing education achievement gaps or reducing poverty. However, universities struggle to provide the labor intensive, face-to-face coaching necessary for student innovators to tackle real-world problems. This project develops a novel online project-based learning platform that helps instructors more effectively coach innovation project teams. The platform allows instructors to (a) create libraries of project goals to help students plan, (b) collaboratively author and remix design guides to help students develop technical skills, and (c) crowdsource large group, face-to-face critique to provide feedback on in-progress innovation work. The research and development in this project focus on overcoming the technical risks associated with creating the software libraries necessary to create new project-based learning platforms and supporting the complex computer-supported collaborative learning interactions necessary to achieve desired learning outcomes. By developing the technologies necessary to enable more effective project-based learning, this project will improve university education and create a more capable innovation workforce better able to tackle societal challenges.


    This SBIR Phase I project will conduct research and development of the Loft platform, which combines a novel project-based learning environment, social media platform, and software components to transform how universities train social innovators. Technical risks in this project stem from software engineering, learning sciences, and computer-supported cooperative work obstacles associated with creating novel software platforms to enable new pedagogical strategies that achieve more effective learning outcomes in project-based learning environments. Software libraries will include a more powerful and flexible set of components for creating complex object hierarchies and social media interfaces required for rapid development of the crowdsourcing and real-time collaborative editing features needed for online project-based learning platforms. The platform will introduce new computer-supported collaborative learning strategies, such as collaborative remixing of instructional content, technology-supported tailoring of instructional goals to individual project teams, and crowd critique to provide feedback as good or better than individual instructors. Research and development will test the impact of the platform on learning outcomes for innovation teams.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to drive economic growth and innovation by increasing a knowledge worker's ease of access to the digital information that is relevant to his/her work. Businesses today are enormously dependent on the archives of files, communication, and other information contained within the systems and services they rely on (networked drives, cloud storage, messaging tools, email, etc.). As these archives grow, they are increasingly hard to standardize and organize so that individuals know where to look for and how to find the information they need to do their jobs. The result is that individual employees waste enormous amounts of time trying to locate files and information fragmented across complex directories and many communication channels. Centralizing access to files and communication within an easily searchable and flexible workspace can unlock several hours of lost productivity and duplicate efforts per knowledge worker per week. Furthermore, presenting all of the relevant context around each file and message, including other file-versions, related files, discussions, activity events, etc., can help knowledge workers today with better version control, an understanding of how projects/ideas unfold, transferring of best practices, and preventing institutional knowledge-loss.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to further develop a novel method for users to contextually and unobtrusively access all relevant files and information associated with their work. This project focuses on developing software that can automatically map the relationships between digital workflow components (email messages, chat messages, tasks, contacts, files, etc.), and store them in discrete private databases controlled by the users. This project's key technical challenges include: improving the proprietary algorithms that automatically interconnect user information (while the information remains hosted on third party systems/services); improving the scalability of data ingress, processing, indexing, and syncing; and establishing a system capable of hosting and processing a multitude of discrete and disconnected databases of user information. The anticipated outcome of this project is a new type of software platform that can be hosted in private instances and that improves the productivity of its users by: consolidating user information stored on third-party systems/services; making it all easily searchable and manageable; and augmenting every file with additional history and context from all other connected third party systems/services.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result from enabling businesses to process and extract insights from large unlabeled datasets, using machine learning with minimal human supervision, in application areas such as cyber security, precision medicine and predictive maintenance.  Current deep learning approaches require large amounts of labeled data.  Creation of labeled data is expensive, error prone and time consuming. The proposed software will provide fully automated capabilities for semi-supervised learning for anomaly detection in cyber security applications. All businesses ranging from large scale enterprises to boutique data science consulting firms will benefit from this project. The expected impact can range in the billions of dollars in the areas of cyber security and predictive maintenance, to name just two. More broadly the proposed technologies will enable both corporations and public institutions to harvest large datasets at minimal cost.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, develop, and deploy high-performance computing (HPC) software for unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. In the last decades tremendous successes in machine learning have been achieved in the area of supervised learning that requires compilation of large datasets with labels (for example, grouping of pictures based on the individual depicted on the image). In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labels and thus require minimal human participation. However, due to significant technical difficulties they have not been as successful as supervised learning algorithms. This software package circumvents these difficulties and opens the way to scaling unsupervised learning algorithms to large and complex datasets.  The main research and development challenges that will be addressed in this project are the ability to integrate this new technology with real world complex datasets through the choice of the correct comparison function between the objects of the dataset and the fully automatic algorithm and algorithm parameter selection.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to disrupt the 1000 hours per child per year where American children have no school and no parents and deserve access to the best enrichment activities. The company plans to build a much-needed technical infrastructure for schools, enrichment providers, and parents. By automating and simplifying the process of providers supplying, parents consuming and schools hosting enrichment activities, the proposed system will remove significant friction and create an efficient market. A key invention is the company's Automatic Schedule Recommendation System which recommends a schedule of classes for a family of one or more children and satisfies constraints such as ages and driving distance, maximizes desirable attributes such as minimal driving and diversity in classes across time, and leverages historical data like classes taken in the past and social data such as classes enjoyed by friends and classmates, to make effective recommendations. The proposed technology removes the most significant friction during parents' purchases of enrichment classes, namely, piecing together a class schedule from classes across different providers. This project is the first interdisciplinary research that strategically combines algorithms from the fields of optimizations and recommender systems to solve the problem and achieve scalability and efficiency.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design, implement and evaluate an Automatic Schedule Recommendation System. Existing recommender systems are insufficient because they largely recommend a single item to a single user; this application requires that a sequence of items (namely, a sequence of classes that fit in a coherent schedule) be recommended and coordinated among a group of users (i.e. children in the same family or set of friends). Existing class scheduling algorithms are insufficient because they find optimal schedules using known preferences; in this problem there is a need to predict preferences. The company will design a fully-automatic schedule recommendation system that predicts the suitability of each session to each user using machine learning techniques and aggregates these predictions over time to propose full schedules that are most appropriate for a parent and satisfy multi-dimensional constraints. The resulting system will be deployed to the company's users along with extensive evaluation of its efficacy.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes the creation of a unique, art-centric e-learning platform aimed at sparking the interest of young learners in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). This extensible software platform implements a new category of e-learning based on the ample body of research in educational psychology and technology that advocates the use of art and guided play to teach STEM. This project will test the hypothesis that an e-learning system based on scientific illustration sparks engagement and enhances learning in young students. With students disengaging from STEM at an increasing rate, it is critical to make more tools available to teachers that connect student with STEM. STEM-related fields will drive innovation in our economy for decades to come; opening new pathways to vastly broaden participation in STEM is critical to our economic future. This project also proposes the creation of an online community and marketplace supporting STEM education through this platform. This will connect teacher-to-teacher for sharing best practices in teaching science using art and can make a deep and broad impact on the way STEM is taught.


    Built on scientific illustration and coupled with a set of tangible user interface (TUI) devices that mimic scientific instruments, this e-learning platform brings student hand-drawn art to life, creating interactive lessons that correlate to Next Generation Science Standards. As this system will be extensible and customizable, a major part of the R&D effort will be to create an easy-to-use templating toolkit that any teacher can leverage to develop custom lessons in STEM. The Phase I goal will be to create a fully functioning product and assess this system in elementary school classrooms. This toolkit will be developed in collaboration with Curio Interactive?s educational partners, as well as the Pacific Science Center, where Curio Interactive is a startup in residence, to rapidly develop this system, continuously iterating the software with real testers, following agile development methods. One of this project?s objectives is to appeal to groups historically underrepresented in STEM. Because this platform will be visual and kinetic, highly affordable, and universally available via the web, the proposed platform will improve the equity and accessibility of learning science.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a mobile technology that can train healthcare professionals in science-based skills to break the habit of unconscious bias. Unconscious biases result from learned sets of mostly false and negative associations between a trait and a social group, i.e. stereotypes, that distort how people perceive, reason, and make decisions about other people. In healthcare, these biases often begin a chain of discriminatory interactions that lead to misdiagnoses, increased hospitalization, and unnecessary repeat visits that sustain health disparities and cause tremendous suffering to millions of Americans. Furthermore, these disparities cost the American economy multibillion dollars annually. This project aims to address both these challenges through a scalable mobile technology that will create learning experiences for providers to adopt skills that break the habit of unconscious bias. The project will further NSF's mission by advancing health, prosperity, and welfare of all Americans so they can receive the highest quality of care untainted by unconscious bias. The project's success would contribute to creating a healthier and productive American population, workforce, and economy. A successful outcome of this effort could spur its extension to other sectors, including education, law enforcement, and business.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in demonstrating that the company's proprietary methodology enables healthcare providers to develop greater self-awareness about their unconscious biases and thus reduce health disparities. The project will create novel employment of technological, discursive, and experiential learning using a mobile application that offers and incentivizes the practice of bias breaking tools to fully and sustainably break the habit of unconscious bias. The mobile platform will be intentionally designed with the end user's experience and interactions in mind to incentivize them every day to learn and practice activities that transform unconscious biases in themselves. The goal in Phase I is threefold: to determine user preferences in design and experience for adopting new skills and building new habits; develop a high-fidelity beta-test for a limited number of experiences that teach breaking bias skills over a mobile platform; and test its usability and desirability with a representative number of healthcare providers.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop and test a computer-based expert system that will guide development of beginning literacy curricula in any phonics-based language. The system will produce beginning literacy curricula mobile apps for phones and tablets and will include beginning reading, writing, vocabulary-building, and assessment activities. The expert system will (a) minimize cost, time and expertise required to develop early literacy curricula, (b) produce curricula that could increase early reading fluency and bilingualism, which is related to children's improved ability to manage their thoughts, behaviors and emotions, (c) provide effective curricula to learn languages other than English at home or school, (d) revitalize endangered or underserved languages while increasing connections to culture and heritage, which will improve long-term academic, health and economic outcomes for indigenous children or children who speak a language other than English at home, and increase their participation in STEM careers, and (e) contribute to research on bilingualism's impacts on academic, social, emotional, and cultural outcomes. The system will be licensed by underserved language communities, tribes, individuals, and organizations interested in improving literacy, with revenue produced by the mobile app products developed using the expert system shared between curriculum developers and the expert system developer.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop and test a knowledge-based expert system that integrates early literacy research; language analysis to provide evidence-based recommendations for developing decodable text for phonics-based early literacy curricula; evidence-based teaching and formative assessment strategies; curriculum development knowledge; user interface/user experience best-practices; natural language processing for pronunciation feedback; and database and technology skills to guide users who may not have the knowledge and skills in developing a beginning literacy curricula in any language. The best practices and methods based on the research will be incorporated by analyzing text to create lists of sounds/letters and words, their frequencies, and sounds and words that come before and after each sound/word. From these lists, the system will generate language-specific recommendations based on the rules for optimal sequencing of sounds and words for learning to decode in another language. While some evidence-based guidelines needed for decoding in English, which is less phonetically regular than many underserved languages, may not apply in a language that is more phonetically regular, most are expected to. These rules will guide recommendations from which users of the knowledge-based expert system can select sequences sounds, words, and phrases to write decodable, connected text, culturally relevant stories for beginning literacy curricula.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of a cost-effective, environmental and economically sound Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) production facility based on a finite number of horseshoe crabs (HSC) using minimally impactful and novel bleeding procedures.  The goal is to address the demands of an estimated $114 million LAL market and finished kit market in excess of $1 billion per annum. Success of this project also anticipates exceeding current standards by ensuring biomedical and pharmaceutical manufacturing compliance with fewer total horseshoe crabs than the number that die annually from current practices. New approaches to HSC bleeding developed in this project would also enable repeated, controlled bleeding while maintaining optimal conditions for animal vitality and for the adjacent communities. Assuming optimized, scalable HSC bleeding operations could eventually expand current supplies, innovative applications could be developed. For example, early detection of sepsis could help avert some $30 billion in direct care every year in the US, notwithstanding the potential to save countless lives with development of gram-negative screening tools for hospital acquired septicemia.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an alternative method of bleeding horseshoe crabs (HSCs) for Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) harvest. The overarching objective to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of an implantable, and surgical-grade device engineered to facilitate routine bleeding, without compromising the integrity and well-being of the HSC. This will be achieved via a systematic study of HSC bleeding outcomes to investigate whether such a device can meet the sterility and quality standards of traditional approaches, while obviating the need for extraneous transport to expensive, inland bleeding facilities. Furthermore, the commercial opportunity and feasibility of the device paired with a habitat-based, enclosed system to systematically monitor HSC wellbeing will be investigated. This SBIR Phase I project would be the first to investigate an alternative approach to bleeding HSCs, a technique that has not changed significantly since the late 1800's. At scale, the proposed approach would also be expected to improve product quality and traceability, and ultimately the bottom line of companies producing LAL kits, given a surplus of LAL in the supply chain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make non-pharmacological treatment of depression accessible to all patients. According to the World Health Organization, 350 million individuals are affected by depression. In the United States, depression affects 16 million people and it costs $210 billion a year in lost productivity and care for the illnesses related to the disease. Antidepressant drugs are coupled with negative side effects and they are ineffective in 30% of the cases. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved non-invasive method for depression therapy that consists in the administration of short electromagnetic pulses on patient?s scalp to stimulate regions of the brain involved in mood control. This SBIR Phase I project will help the generation of a new rTMS system that will improve outcomes of depression treatment by stimulating deeper brain cells and reducing the incidence of pain and discomfort associated with current rTMS therapy. The new device will allow broad distribution of rTMS based therapy for both professional clinicians and, in the future, home-care settings. It will avoid reliance on drugs to people affected by depression and it will reduce the impact of depression on society.

    The SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and demonstrate the efficacy a new wearable rTMS stimulator device. Although rTMS has a 75% success ratio on depressed patients, 40% of subjects report pain, headaches and discomfort during therapy with current rTMS systems, resulting in a high dropout rate. This is mainly due to poor localization of electromagnetic pulses with commercially available rTMS devices. The new system will combine a new technology that stimulates the brain?s deepest regions involved in depression with unprecedented precision and a new protective shield designed to ward off unwanted heat away from the head, reducing scalp pain and discomfort. The project will develop and validate the efficacy of these components and their integration into a wearable helmet. The project will also demonstrate the superiority of the new device over current gold standard rTMS solutions. The company expects that this research will lead to the generation of a new device capable of treating depression patients through precise stimulation reducing over 40% the unwanted heat, thereby preventing headache and scalp discomfort.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project include development of a commercial proof-of-concept percutaneous directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator which may provide medical practitioners a new approach for treating cancer. In clinical use, a directional MWA applicator will facilitate both procedural and technical simplification of MWA treatments, saving time and critical resources in hospitals, and ultimately improve quality of, and access to, cancer treatment for a broad range of patients. The research and development proposed in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding of miniaturized MWA antennas capable of radiating with directional patterns. Specifically, special materials to reduce required antenna dimension and increase efficiency, and advanced antenna designs to maximize the size of directional ablation zones will be studied during this project. Commercial development of the proposed technical advances could expand their use for the treatment of other medical conditions or for applications in other industries such as wireless communications. This STTR Phase I project will contribute to the creation of technology jobs in Kansas, a region where there are few medical or technology companies.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a commercial proof-of-concept directional microwave ablation (MWA) applicator. MWA procedures offer cost-effective, minimally-invasive treatment options for localized tumors and other disease. These treatments are especially important to the large population of cancer patients who are poor candidates for surgery or other physically demanding therapies. However, currently available MWA systems employ applicators with omni-directional radiation patterns, which if not placed precisely may damage critical healthy tissues or result in disease recurrence. A directional MWA applicator can facilitate technical and procedural simplifications which to alleviate these current challenges. We will investigate: (1) alternative materials to shrink antenna cross-section and (2) novel antenna geometries to maximize the size of directional microwave ablation zones. We will employ an approach integrating multiphysics computational models, benchtop experimentation in ex vivo tissue, and experiments in animal models in vivo to design, optimize, and validate our device. Our anticipated technical results are the development of a MWA applicator that provides directional control of radiation pattern that can ablate to depths of greater than 30 mm, creating an ablation volume comparable to current clinical non-directional devices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is an inexpensive handheld smartphone device for rapid detection of the toxigenic cholera pathogen in environmental water sources. Contaminated water sources place populations at risk for contracting cholera. Once contracting the disease, patients with cholera exhibit symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration and, if left untreated, ultimately death. Wide-scale cholera outbreaks devastated Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017, affecting over one million total individuals. Currently, methods used to detect the cholera pathogen in water involves a 3 to 5-day water collection and cell culture procedure. This project proposes a portable smartphone platform used to detect the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, in under 30 minutes at the water source. Smartphone connectivity, will also enable geomapped and time-stamped detection results. This novel and proactive approach for detection can enable organizations to remediate water sources prior to communities contracting and spreading cholera. Downstream, this technology will save the time and costs currently associated with cholera outbreaks and can be expanded to other infectious diseases.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a rapid, cost-effective, and robust smartphone platform to detect Vibrio cholerae and automate the detection result at an environmental water source. The device performs isothermal DNA amplification assay combined with the novel sensing approach, particle diffusometry. This project proposes to characterize the specificity, sensitivity, and lower limit of detection of Vibrio cholerae detection on the smartphone platform. The detection results will be compared against current gold-standard quantitative DNA amplification methods. Further, a reagent storage method involving freeze drying will be used to eliminate the need for cold-chain storage. We will assess the long-term stability of our assay reagents through accelerated aging studies. Lastly, a low powered integrated heating unit will be designed to perform the isothermal DNA amplification assays in the handheld device. At the completion of this Phase I project, an integrated smartphone platform will be ready for field testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project can be summarized as follows. (1) Businesses will benefit from the proposed product because companies are increasingly using data-driven predictive models to improve their bottom line. In many areas where structured data are readily available, such as credit scoring, these models have produced impressive returns on investment. One of the main obstacles hindering the application of these models in other areas is the lack of structured data. By extracting information from sources such as web pages, blogs and social media messages, and storing it as structured data, companies will be able to take advantage of the vast amount of unstructured data that are generated daily and thereby improve their bottom line. (2) As the Chinese economy expands and becomes more deeply intertwined with the US economy, many US businesses will need high-quality and timely information about Chinese markets. However, information extraction from Chinese text is an underserved area. The proposed product can fill this void and thereby meet a significant commercial demand.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new information extraction (IE) method. Currently IE focuses on information extraction from short text snippets consisting of a few words in order to derive structured factual information from unstructured text. But its performance is often deteriorated by the shortage of features - the sparse feature problem. A major benefit of the approach developed in this project is that it takes advantage of the important role of specific linguistic units even when the number of words in a sentence is limited. These linguistic units give a sentence its structure. Depending on structural characteristics or functional principles of sentences, the features around them are grouped. The grouped features satisfy certain properties and can be used to capture structural and semantic information, which is helpful for minimizing the sparse feature problem.

    at over $100M. The research of new polymeric materials at universities is at an
    all-time high. Despite this, there exists a gap in the commercialization of new
    materials because of the difficulty in interfacing these materials to other common
    construction materials, such as stainless steel. This work will contribute fundamental
    knowledge to and catalyze the development of processes for new advanced polymer
    products. It will enable the use of UHMWPE and other materials in new applications.
    \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is the development of an advanced manufacturing

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable more efficient access to information, goods, and services from organizations and businesses through conversational interfaces. With an estimated 33 million voice-activated devices installed in the U.S. by the end of 2017, consumers are beginning to see the benefits of the rise in business services on these devices. Interacting with computers in natural language is more efficient than ever before, and business are urgently seeking to include their services on this new modality. Yet, while advances in machine learning have increased the speed and accuracy with which conversational interfaces are built, today's solutions still result in major bottlenecks in the development process. Addressing these bottlenecks would result in significant savings of time and resources for businesses, in addition to increased convenience for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project advances the development of machine learning and natural language processing technologies that will enable rapid creation of conversational interfaces and increase the efficiency with which individuals interact with computers. Despite major recent advances in conversational interface tooling, current bottlenecks in building robust conversational interfaces still exist, as portions of the development process go from highly-automated to manually-programmed. Instead, the proposed approach will achieve end-to-end automation using an innovative LSTM sequence-to-sequence machine learning model to learn and simulate human behavior on a web page, as well as a new system for open-domain question answering.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to enable smaller businesses to participate to the chatbot revolution, by making it easier to design and deploy chatbots. The initial focus of this project is healthcare, where there is great opportunity to improve the quality and availability of patient services. The key technological innovation is the facilitation of an ecosystem of chatbot designers and agents, through the creation of novel chatbot design, collaboration and deployment tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create the technology to allow chatbot designers to incorporate human agents into the logical flow of chatbots. Currently, chatbots are designed in an ad-hoc trial-and-error manner, which is infeasible for small businesses who do not have the resources to constantly refine and evaluate their chatbots. The project will also create techniques to allow human agents to be productive when taking over chatbot sessions, and allow designers to improve the logical flow of chatbots based on usage data.

    This SBIR Phase I project will create a novel educational product by pairing VR/360 video with impact measurement software and interactive social engagement tools to simulate true-to-life experiences that enable users to gain personal insight into pressing social issues and then take action to solve them. Installed either as a multisensory 'empathy exhibition' or used in a classroom setting, participants embark on a transformative learning journey which builds empathy and critical understanding about a social issue and those affected by it, then connects them to concrete opportunities to make social change. Users begin as uniformed participants, and through the proposed process emerge as changemakers engaged in solving social problems. Experiential learning has long been an empathy building discipline outside the mediated experience, yet it is encumbered by barriers of cost, safety, distance, time and access that limit participation. Transformation360 will use technology to render experiential learning programs virtually anywhere. The result will be a revolutionary new way to move the public from apathy to action on a limitless number of social issues. Transformation360 will provide nonprofits, governments, and institutions working to solve social problems with a powerful social engagement tool that creates actively engaged citizens, consumers, volunteers, supporters, and social entrepreneurs to address the world's most pressing social problems.


    This SBIR Phase I project will develop a VR/360 video hybridization that will allow users interactive choices within a conventional three-degree-of-freedom 360 Video experience. Currently only VR's computer-generated imaging can provide a significant choice landscape for users. By using 360/3D photography, unique game engine software and multi-scenario video capture in the field the project will give users a new level of choice options for a photo documentary experiences. The efficacy of this technology for building empathy will be quantified through audience testing. Also, cinematic techniques such as mise-en-cine and montage, not currently used in most 360 video projects, will also be tested against audience reactions. These video production and consumption technologies and techniques will also be cross-tested against experience learning processes such as the breaking down assumptions, peer learning, debriefing, uncertainty, and risk. Potential adverse side effects to VR/360 video will also be addressed. The project will rely heavily on the engagement measurement and data visualization tool Harvis to test and analyze audience reactions to these experiments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focused on a novel seat design that reduces vehicle-based whole-body vibration and shock will 1) better protect human health while 2) addressing major transportation markets including trucking, agriculture, construction, military vehicles, and mass transit, as well as automobiles and water-/land-based recreational vehicles.  The envisioned socio-economic impact is significant:  Continual exposure to whole-body vibration and shocks can cause discomfort, reduction in work performance, and chronic low-back pain for vehicle operators and passengers.  Low-back pain is the largest component of disability among all occupational-related injuries. Though so-called "active" seats can help reduce these vibrations/shocks, their high cost is a major barrier. The low-cost seats being pursued here could benefit millions of vehicle operators. The work will also result in a greater scientific and technological understanding of the sources/effects of and potential remedies for whole-body vibration and shock. The suspension system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.11%, by value, from 2016 to 2021. The market is expected to grow from USD 52.38 Billion in 2015 to USD 67.22 Billion by 2021.  The market for bus seats alone is expected to be at $10.03 Billion by the year 2022.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on the feasibility of a quasi-semi-active seat (QSAS) technology.  Seating design for heavy equipment and vehicle operators has faced a trade-off between performance and cost. The most-complex 'active seats' reduce vibration but are cost-prohibitive at $3,500. Semi-active seats are simplified active seats and perform better than passive seats, but still magnify input vibration and cost several thousand dollars. Passive seats are the least expensive, but they magnify input vibration at low frequencies.  Recent design/material advances and strong preliminary data set the stage for developing an innovative passive seat at a fraction of the cost of semi-active seats that will reduce input vibration at low frequencies. Phase I feasibility will be shown using sliding friction to mitigate vibration at low frequency.  A QSAS prototype will be built and used to show potential in laboratory and field settings.  Technical challenges will involve material selection that will show maximum vibration mitigation and dissipation, as well as integration of the cushion with a suspension system that can handle the weight of a seated person. The research will determine effective performance parameters under different magnitudes and frequencies of vibration that simulate realistic operational conditions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is reduced levelized cost of electricity (LCOE)
    of offshore wind from current levels that are about twice that of onshore wind.
    Given the proximity of offshore wind resources to load centers along the coast,
    it is an attractive renewable energy source for the nation, but high costs are
    an impediment to widespread adoption. One way to address this is with larger turbines
    that can lead to lower ?balance of plant? costs, which can be as high as 65% of
    the total project costs of offshore wind. However, turbine rating is currently
    limited due to the large size and weight of the generator and the rotor, as well
    as infrastructure obstacles like manufacturing, transport, and assembly. The lightweight
    superconducting (SC) generators being developed within this project, coupled with
    advanced rotors already being developed by the OEM?s, could open the door to significantly
    larger turbine ratings and lower costs. The underlying high specific power machine
    technology can also help transform a number of other weight-sensitive electrical
    systems like hybrid electric airplanes and ship propulsion.\n \nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to disrupt the traditional risk
    versus benefit trade of the low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) SC technology
    by significantly increasing the benefits with a novel ?active magnetic shielding?
    concept. This design concept enables a very high operating magnetic field within
    the machine while eliminating the need for a yoke made of ferromagnetic steel
    to contain the field. The higher internal fields increase the electromagnetic
    torque significantly over other solutions, leading to very high power density.
    Additionally, the elimination of heavy iron from the magnetic circuit leads to
    further reduction in weight. The proposed generator design can be about half the
    size of currently available wind direct-drives. Efficiency is also expected to
    improve with the elimination of about a third of copper coils while maintaining
    the same current density. Available cryogenic cooling technology from the commercially
    successful magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry will be adapted and utilized
    in the machine to reduce many of the cryogenics related risks while maintaining
    high specific power.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    drug delivery to solid tumors, with a primary focus on liver cancer. Every year,
    30,000 men and women are diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
    (HCC), which has a 5-year survival rate of 17.6 %. The prognosis for these patients
    is poor. Currently, there are no curative treatments for these patients. The current
    standard-of-care only increases overall survival by months and has toxic side
    effects, with a cost to the US healthcare system of $1.5B per year. This technology
    is based on the inherent feature of bacteria to colonize solid tumors throughout
    the body in ratios of 100,000 to 1 compared to healthy tissue. Due to this specificity,
    the developed bacterial platform has the potential to increase dosage specifically
    in tumors, while reducing toxic side effects in healthy tissues. This platform
    will be a toolbox that can target intracellular pathways that are currently considered
    undruggable and deliver potent doses of biologicals directly into tumor cells.
    The affinity of bacteria for solid tumors, independent of organ localization,
    enables the extension of this delivery method to other hard-to-treat tumor types,
    such as pancreas, ovarian and gastric cancer. \n\nSystemic cancer therapies have
    many obstacles, such as stability in the blood, traversing the cellular membrane,
    internalization and endosomal release. These processes impede the use of RNAi
    and peptides in humans and hamper the targeting of intracellular pathways with
    monoclonal antibodies. The development of a bacterial drug delivery platform can
    optimize drug potency in tumors and reduce side effects in healthy tissue. In
    this SBIR phase I, efficacy of this platform will be measured in HCC by targeting
    intracellular pathways essential for cell survival, for which no systemic therapy
    exists. A bacterial strain will be created according to FDA guidelines that can
    be manufactured reliably without loss of activity. An optimized preservation protocol
    will be developed to ensure maximal bacterial fitness and maximal delivery efficacy
    after administration. This bacterial delivery system has the potential to accelerate
    the translation of fundamental cancer research into clinical therapies. Discoveries
    could be genetically translated directly into protein, antibody or shRNA therapies
    that regulate mammalian gene expression and function.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a system that can identify a broad range of bacteria in < 1 hour directly from blood. Existing diagnostic systems require 2-6 days to identify the bacteria, which delays treatment using appropriate antibiotics. Sepsis, which is often caused by a bacterial infection, contributes to up to half of all hospital deaths in the US largely due to complications arising from delays or inappropriate treatment (which is mainly because of lack of information regarding the infection-causing bacteria). It is the most expensive hospital-treated condition in the United States ? representing $20.3 billion in healthcare costs. The proposed system aims to sharply reduce the time to provide information needed by physicians, enabling them to initiate treatment using the appropriate antibiotic rapidly. This is expected to lead to significant reductions in costs, complications, and mortality. Further, by eliminating the need for culturing, new insights into bacterial behavior can be acquired contributing to additional fundamental knowledge of bacteria. This knowledge will aid antibiotic discovery efforts, improve understanding of mechanisms of drug resistance, support new biomanufacturing processes through faster detection of bacterial contamination of pharmaceutical products and foods, and characterization of the microbiome.

    The challenges of rapid bacterial identification are primarily in two areas ? sample preparation, that eliminates the need for culturing, and multiplex identification, to cover the diverse range of bacterial species capable of causing infection. The proposed work is based on leveraging the differential response between bacteria and the cells in a sample matrix to selectively break down the sample matrix, but not bacteria, such that the largest lysis debris is smaller than intact bacteria. The debris is subsequently separated from intact bacteria using a size-based technique enabling rapid isolation of a broad range of bacteria directly from the sample. A novel Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy system is then used to identify the isolated bacteria at clinically relevant concentrations. No bacteria-specific reagents are employed. The proposed Phase I work addresses the highest risk technical hurdles in the process. Isolating and detecting low concentration of bacteria directly from blood is accomplished through the three objectives of this project that optimize the purification and bacterial recovery from the sample, identification accuracy, and performance of the integrated system relative to the traditional culturing-based method.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide spoof-free biometric fingerprint sensors. Consumer confidence in adopting many technologies such as IoT devices, and reach a cash-less society is limited by our confidence in transactions being fraud-free. Around the world, there are varying degrees of fraud and it is well known that poorer countries have higher levels of fraud then more advanced countries. By providing a trustable biometric device, the proposed commercialization plan will allow lower levels of fraud and allow greater degree of economic activity bringing up standards of living. The technology of GHz ultrasonics for sensing also has the potential for to be used for applications in being able to image baby fingerprints, enable fingerprint readers in fire-arms for authenticated use at very fast speeds, and allow integration with credit and debit cards. The success of the commercial activities will create a new paradigm for trusting the electronic economy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop revolutionary new biometric sensors. Biometric technologies range from sensing the unique patterns of the eyes, to voice, and fingerprints amongst other markers. Capacitive fingerprint sensors, and optical fingerprint sensors are very commonly found in smartphones and desktop applications. These technologies produce images that are often limited in resolution and are not spoof-proof. For example, optical fingerprint readers can be spoofed by fingerprint images and capacitive fingerprint sensors can be spoofed by skin-like dielectric polymer fingerprint molds. Ultrasonic images offer the potential for detecting tissue material properties that can help identify fake fingerprints. Although many low-frequency technologies for ultrasonic fingerprint sensing are available, very few have made it into the market in large quantities owing to cost, packaging, and insufficient SNR and resolution. In this project the company will extend the frequency of operation to the GHz range to achieve four to eight times the standard industry standard of 500 dpi resolution. Coupled with integrated circuits operating at low voltages, the company aims for integration of the sensors in very thin platforms such as credit cards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to spark more cybersecurity innovations, by reducing the R&D expenditures via providing fundamental security analytics tools as a service. Global cybersecurity spending is increasing significantly year over year. Enormous R&D resources have been invested in the development of a range of security products to meet this market. However, different security product providers repeatedly build the fundamental security analytics tools and use them to further develop different innovative security solutions. That is a huge waste of R&D resources.  The proposed solution reduces the R&D expenditure of customers and lowers the entry bar for the growing cybersecurity market. With the lowered entry bar, the company anticipates that more innovations will be put into practice. As a result, with the increased competition and reduced R&D expenditure, the company expects a reduction in cybersecurity spending by companies and the government.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on malware intelligence, which has been a long-standing as well as increasingly complex cybersecurity problem. Traditional signature based detection and manual reverse engineering approaches can no longer keep up with the pace of increasingly sophisticated obfuscation and attack techniques. The objective of this project is to develop a security analysis tool for malware intelligence by combining the following two unique techniques: "whole-system emulation based dynamic binary analysis" and "deep-learning based binary code similarity detection". The first technique provides a fine-grained monitor capability to observe the behaviors of malware. The second technique provides the capability of learning and characterizing complex features. By combining these two techniques, the proposed technology will be able to better understand malware and generate actionable intelligence.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the restoration of trust in computing systems.  Successful cyberattacks, including mass privacy breaches and the discovery of device backdoors, have shaken trust in computing, put users at risk, hurt the economy, and even threatened our national security.  The usual set of ad-hoc, incomplete, and costly approaches simply have not addressed the problem.  This research effort will advance a viable, practical, and holistic solution that gives users much stronger guarantees of security while lowering the costs of keeping systems secure.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop TigerGuard, a computer system security architecture that contains the effects of cyberattacks on existing computer infrastructure.  TrustGuard is based on a small, separately manufactured, and easy-to-verify hardware element, called the Sentry, that serves as the root of trust.  The Sentry is a general-purpose hardware trust component that, when combined with an application-specific Dynamic Specification Check (DSC) software component, provides flexible containment capabilities.  The containment guarantees of TigerGuard hold despite design and manufacturing flaws (known and not-yet-known, malicious and unintentional) in the operating system, firmware, hardware, and software, including those in the application software itself. Formal verification of both the Sentry and DSC, a practical effort given their total size of only a few thousand lines of code, becomes equivalent in security guarantees to proving hundreds of millions of existing lines of code correct (including the processor design, memory implementation, hard drive firmware, the operating system, shared libraries, and the application code).

    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will result from a direct benefit to the energy
    sector of the U.S. economy, since seismic exploration will play an increasingly
    important role in meeting increasing energy demands and maintaining healthy oil
    and gas output. The goal of this project is to develop a software package for
    automated pattern recognition that can be used by seismic processing companies
    to automatically pick geological features from seismic data. Seismic data volumes
    have grown exponentially over the last three decades as the seismic exploration
    industry increases its survey coverage. Manual picking and geological pattern
    identification jobs, which depend on visual inspection, are labor intensive and
    cannot keep up with the growth in data generated by seismic surveys. In this project,
    the company will develop a machine vision enabled picking and identification tool
    trained by a deep learning network. Lessons learned in training an efficient deep
    learning network for pattern recognition have wide applications in other areas
    such as medical image analysis. This project will support the training of both
    graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of seismic exploration, machine
    learning and high-performance computing. \n\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer
    (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a deep learning network model to recognize
    unique patterns embedded in seismic data, which patterns are characteristic of
    the associated geological structures. Specifically, the project will demonstrate
    the feasibility of delivering a machine vision enabled inspection tool to relieve
    domain experts from labor-intensive visual examination activities. Various automatic
    picking approaches currently exist, with differing degrees of success. Nonetheless,
    the uncertainty involved in these tools is still too high for them to be widely
    adopted by the industry. Recent advances in the area of deep learning make it
    possible to surpass human-level visual recognition performance in some applications.
    High performance deep learning network models, however, require a large amount
    of high quality training data. In this project, the company proposes to use a
    novel self-taught deep transfer learning approach to overcome the data shortage
    problem resulting from proprietary rights associated with the data. The new training
    workflow is adaptive to the domain of seismic data processing. It will also minimize
    the training effort and deliver a robust system with guaranteed performance for
    new and unseen datasets."

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will develop a metal-free route to the production of high performance plastics and composites. Specifically, this project focuses on a unique class of materials based upon a thermoset that displays high strength-to-weight ratio and exceptional fracture toughness. A challenge to broader adoption of these materials stems from the current reliance on metal-based reagents and catalysts for their production. The metals impose a significant recurring cost of production, show sensitivity to air, and remain as contaminants in the final products. This innovation provides the first metal-free access to such materials. Additionally, the unique metal-free catalyst system is capable of producing resin and polymer feedstocks that are not available from metal-based reagents, and may offer advantages in processing and performance. The projected commercial impacts of the innovation will be enhanced material performance, lower cost products, and broadened (new) fields of use. The existing market is estimated to be $578M with 4.9% annual growth through 2023.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the invention and development of the first metal-free route to olefin metathesis polymers and oligomers. Prior art has demonstrated on small scale the ability to use a unique organocatalyst to produce polymer and resin feedstocks that are easily processable into high performance thermosets and composites. The organocatalyst approach is a divergence from all previous methods of producing materials via olefin metathesis and therefore warrants validation and optimization toward commercial scale-up. The Phase I research aims will include (1) scale-up through the design and implementation of flow reactor technologies, (2) mechanical analyses and product specification sheets for thermoset prototypes, and (3) evaluation of new resins and polymers for use in fiber reinforced composite materials.  The results should be useful commercially and academically.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a fermentation-based technology that enables the renewable and sustainable production of medium-chain fatty acids - an important class of widely used industrial chemicals - using glycerol-rich waste streams as feedstocks. These chemical products constitute a growing multi-billion dollar market with applications in the flavoring, fragrances, personal care, plastics, textile, and pharmaceutical industries. This technology also will create new high-value uses for existing glycerol-rich waste streams generated within the bio-diesel industry, which can greatly improve the economic competitiveness of bio-diesel with fossil diesel, especially in an era of low oil prices. Thus, commercialization of this fermentation-based technology will serve as a foundation for developing additional eco-friendly technologies for the production of other industrial chemicals that contribute to the ~$800 billion/year petrochemical industry, in turn creating new jobs for helping the environment, benefiting society, and building a sustainable future. In addition, this SBIR project will establish a carbon conservation technology as the basis for developing the next-generation of fermentation-based chemical production technologies.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a unique carbon conserving (C2) platform technology to enable the cost-competitive and sustainable production of a variety of fatty chemicals from renewable feedstocks such as crude glycerol. The C2 platform technology comprises a series of non-natural biosynthetic pathways that minimize/eliminate carbon loss as CO2 during production, thereby improving theoretical yields over the state of the art by as much as 50%. The improved achievable yields along with the anaerobic production processes enabled by the C2 technology are two crucial features for establishing bioprocesses with cost-competitive economics relative to incumbent technologies, which is critical for commercial success. One goal of this Phase I project will be to demonstrate the production of a high-value fatty acid, hexanoic acid, from crude glycerol and using the C2 technology. For the second goal, enzyme screening, strain development, and metabolic engineering approaches will be implemented for improving hexanoic acid production metrics (i.e., higher titers, rates, and yields) from crude glycerol. Accomplishing these goals will substantially de-risk the C2 technology and establish its commercial potential for the cost-advantaged production of hexanoic acid at the commercial level.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it makes high-dimensional data visualization
    more accessible to mainstream users. An interactive multivariate visualization
    framework will assist users in the understanding of complex phenomena and help
    with decision making in the presence of multiple factors. It uses a map-like layout
    of factors and data that naturally appeals to a mainstream user's innate visual
    literacy, making it easy to learn and use. Through a variety of interaction facilities,
    users can define areas in this layout that indicate parameter values of their
    interest. This then enables them to make informed decisions within a single visual
    interface and balance among the diverse impacts the various factors have on the
    decisions. Given the massive growth in the availability of multivariate data,
    the unique capabilities that the proposed framework provides are expected to have
    a strong impact on society, in many application domains and at many different
    levels - personal, business, finance, scientific, medicine, and so on. In short,
    this project will have a significant societal impact by allowing users to make
    better decisions in less time. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project makes several intellectual and scientific contributions. A core
    contribution is the ability to embed high dimensional points and factors into
    a 2D plane or map, such that the distance between points has contextual meaning.
    This allows a single visualization to convey what currently takes a dashboard
    of several bivariate plots to show. The inherent mechanisms that create the combined
    map-like layout of data and factors are novel and open new opportunities to understand
    multivariate data. The same is true for the interactions defined on the layout,
    in particular those that allow users to derive the areas of influence of the various
    factors. Another intellectual contribution is the interface that allows users
    to focus their attention on specific attributes and deals with the mental and
    cognitive overload that may arise in users in the presence of too many factors
    and attributes. The proposed system constructs a meaningful hierarchical representation
    of the attributes that can be navigated within a novel space efficient visual
    interface. Using our design tools, anyone with an internet connection and a modern
    web browser will be able to create these layouts from multivariate data."

    customer needs in prioritized wearable sensor market segments for the endurance
    sports market. One advantage of the proposed sensor is its similar feel to cloth
    fabric, a benefit in comfort and convenience to the user.  This is in contrast
    to current hydration monitors made of thick plastic materials requiring the use
    of an additional wristband or adhesive patch.  This value proposition was developed
    and tested based on the findings of 374 customer interviews during a spring 2017
    NSF I-Corps workshop.  That study determined the commercial and product potential
    of a fabric sensor to monitor hydration.  In 2015 alone more than 17.1 million
    people finished endurance events.  According to interview data, 50% of respondents
    are interested in a hydration solution due to past dehydration and cramping issues.
    Additionally, 40% of respondents indicated interest in a technology-based solution.
    This group equates a target market of $342 million for a hydration monitor priced
    at $100 per unit, a good estimation of the total available market based on I-Corps
    interviews. In general, the data collected from the developed sensor could lead
    to better understanding of health and disease processes, including the analysis
    of common diabetic neurological complications, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
    (CF), and sweat monitoring for advanced prosthetic limb applications, bedridden
    patients, or athlete performance tracking leading to better treatments and health
    outcomes for all patients.  \n\nA monitor that analyzes the sodium concentration
    of a person's sweat would be able to notify them before they begin suffering from
    exercise-induced illnesses such as hypernatremia or hyponatermia. This early notification
    system would allow people to be on top of their hydration, and be able to replenish
    their electrolytes as needed, without overhydrating. The team has developed flexible,
    lightweight fabric materials that can selectively determine physiological information
    from sweat forming on the surface of the skin.  The technology is the first lightweight
    fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during
    exercise or training. These dehydration patterns are unique and vary based on
    diet, weather conditions, and human physiological cycles. The ability to monitor
    an individual's hydration parameters is unique to the proposed sensor and gives
    it a competitive advantage over sweat monitors that monitor water lost or water
    timers that remind the athlete to drink water every 20 minutes.  Specifically,
    the proposed work will focus on the large-scale development of a hydration monitor,
    validation of the monitor during material testing and on the body in an exercise
    physiology laboratory, and leveraging partnerships with potential strategic partners.
    As athletes strive for peak performance, improper hydration can undermine their
    progress in both training and competitive settings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Research (SBIR) project is  the development of an improved methane sensor module
    that can enables new drone sensing and sensor network applications in the energy,
    agricultural, and waste management sectors. Methane, the third largest energy
    source after petroleum and coal in the U.S., is relatively difficult and expensive
    to measure compared to other gasses. It is a major atmospheric pollutant, both
    as a component of smog and as a greenhouse gas. This technology can provide societal
    environmental benefits by helping reduce methane release into the environment
    through the ubiquitous sensing of small natural gas leaks, allowing companies
    to rapidly respond. This sensor system has the sensitivity of laser-based spectrometers
    but is smaller, lighter, and has lower power requirements at a price three orders
    of magnitude less than existing high-end spectrometers. Designed to reduce power,
    weight and cost to a minimum while not compromising sensitivity, this technology
    is ideal for UAV-based measurements. It can also give station mounted and handheld
    monitoring units high sensitivity at a lower price point, enabling multiple monitor
    sampling strategies and a multi-station networked array to track intermittent
    sources of methane leaks. This technology can provide novel capabilities to cost-conscious
    customers in the energy sector while opening up additional markets for agricultural,
    waste management, and safety products. A first prototype of this methane sensor
    successfully measured methane in nitrogen down to 10 ppm. The long-term objective
    is the creation of a commercially available low-cost, high precision methane sensor
    product line. SBIR project funding is enabling the transition of this promising
    sensor technology from a small business research and development project into
    the early commercialization stages of a valuable new product. \n\n\nThis SBIR
    Phase 1 project proposes to create a self-contained methane sensor system, smaller
    in size than a quarter, with the sensitivity of advanced laser spectrometers.
    Current methods of detection do not meet the needs of industry. They are either
    cheap, high power and low sensitivity, such as catalyst-based systems, or they
    are large, expensive, high power optical systems. There is a market need for methane
    sensors that improve upon size, weight and power, while still maintaining useful
    sensitivity and selectivity. The system consists of 3 primary modules: the replaceable
    or consumable sensor package, the sense electronics, and the data storage and
    communication system. Due to the extremely low power requirements of the sensor,
    clever design of the data and communications system is critical if the low power
    benefits of the sensor are to be realized in a product. Ultimately, the system
    will include wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, WiFi, 5G, Zigbee) for cloud and
    IoT data management. This design will be prototyped and will undergo performance
    measurements. Materials for methane sensing will be identified  The objective
    of SBIR Phase 1 is to produce an initial prototype sensor for methane-sensing
    that will be the focus of SBIR Phase II.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    This SBIR Phase I project will advance novel techniques for developing high-resolution noninvasive brain imaging systems, capable of recording unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution inferences of the brain activity for a portable system.  These systems leverage novel fundamental analysis and results, and experimental demonstrations, that show that spatial resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG) is not saturated at densities of a few hundred electrodes, unlike what has been widely believed in clinical and neuroscience community.  They also build on recent work by the PIs that enables faster and reliable acquisition of EEG signals. The success of the proposed work will help diagnose worsening brain injuries before the injury occurs. Brain injuries affect 1.7 million Americans every year. Commercially, it will enable higher resolution brain-machine interfaces for applications such as virtual reality interfacing and neuroprostheses, generating novel avenues for jobs and revenue through creation of an entirely new industry.  This transdisciplinary effort brings together neuroscientists and engineers and the concepts developed in this effort will inform material for basic neuroscience and neuroengineering courses.  The team will continue to publish and publicize their work at clinical conferences.  One of the core employees will be a minority female who has contributed to the research, guided several other minority (and non-minority) female students, and now wants to lead the development end of this project.

    This effort builds a systematic platform that challenges the widely held belief that increasing electrode-densities of EEG to beyond a few hundred electrodes does not improve spatial resolution. There are several problems with the traditional EEG that the platform overcomes: (i) typically only 9-32 electrodes are used for clinical diagnoses and these are fundamentally limited to only providing poor spatial resolution; (ii) because traditional EEGs have low resolution, surgical treatments often require invasive procedures. E.g., for diagnosing severity or worsening of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) by measuring parameters of cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), which are mediators of worsening brain injuries; (iii) long-term EEG measurements are cumbersome, and high-density systems can take hours of manual labor to install. The PIs' preliminary work provides strong evidence supporting the claim that ultra-high-density EEG will provide the first non-invasive and portable modality for high spatial and temporal resolution brain imaging.  Novel brain-imaging algorithms will be developed and benchmarked against existing techniques and assessed using novel fundamental limits.  Novel techniques will be deployed in the design of conductive sponges and in lowering power, enabling the platform to be portable and usable over long term.  These improvements will be rigorously tested through simulations, experiments, and real data analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a low cost Lidar+Thermal camera to the autonomous car market that will eventually enable level 4 and level 5 autonomy. The proposed innovation incorporates both a Lidar and a thermal detector to locate objects but also classify them, as this is the most crucial aspect of autonomous vehicles. The dual polarity Lidar+Thermal photodetector solves a few major issues in the current Lidar industry. First, current Lidars have to use advanced algorithms to classify the objects, whereas a Lidar+Thermal detector can easily distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, while continuing to establish their location. This is done due to the drastic heat signature of animate objects. Second, the dual polarity detector is able to detect and locate hazards on the road such as snow or puddles, which is vital if autonomous vehicles are used in northern regions. In addition, the frame rate of the Flash Lidar+Thermal is up to 200 Frames per second, which will drastically reduce smearing effects and allow for driving at speeds of 70+ MPH. Lastly, the high thermal resolution of the camera will ensure operation in bad weather conditions including fog and rain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide a proof-of-concept of the dual polarity Lidar+Thermal detector. An array of 32x32 pixels will demonstrate that in one polarity, a thermal hot-mid-wave image and in the other polarity the pixels will operate in a time-of-flight mode for Flash Lidar operation. The pixel?s spectral response will range from 500nm up to 3.5?m in the Lidar mode. Characterization of the detector array will use the eye-safe 1550nm laser. The goal is to show a 200m Lidar operation with a high resolution of a few centimeters and thermal imaging with a thermal sensitivity of 4mK. The transition to Phase II will include an array size of 1000x500 with 10?m pixel pitch. The detector will be evaluated outdoors to demonstrate the detection of animate objects, snow and puddles and will be tested under fog conditions.

    The broader impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable a much wider adoption of various photomedical treatments.  Broadly speaking, photomedical treatments use light to cure diseases and promote healing.  Specifically, photodynamic therapy uses light to activate a photosensitizing chemical agent to kill cancer cells or bacterial with minimal side effects.  Moreover, photobiomodulation is the application of light to impaired or dysfunctional tissue to reduce pain and inflammation to speed healing and to promote or inhibit various cellular processes.  The light source is a critical part of any photomedical treatment system.  Existing sources such as lasers and LED arrays are bulky and expensive, generally require additional optics to deliver the light to the target treatment areas.  The current project aims to develop a photomedical treatment system based on a novel light source - quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs).  Flexible and large area QLEDs can be placed immediately adjacent to target treatment areas without additional optics.  Their simple driver requirements will result in much lower system costs and facilitate at-home use.  These QLED-based systems will enable the wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies, including in currently underserved areas and patient populations.

    The proposed project will leverage the recent invention of ultra-bright quantum dot light emitting devices (QLEDs) into a low-cost and convenient-to-use photomedical treatment system that will enable wider adoption of photomedical treatment methodologies for a variety of pathologies and use cases.  Project tasks include developing QLEDs with emitting spectra precisely tuned to match the absorption spectra of photosensitizers at 630 nanometers (nm), 635 nm and 660 nm; fabricating QLEDs on flexible substrates with device structures guided by microcavity simulations; developing a low DC voltage, current-controlled driver able to deliver a precise light dosage; and demonstrating the photomedical efficacy of thus developed QLEDs in a) ALA-PplX photodynamic therapy and associated dosimetry of oral malignancies using in-vitro 3D co-culture models of oral cancers; b) determining and optimizing parameters for photobiomodulation for wound healing applications including incisional and pressure ulcer wounds, in-vitro using multiple cell lines and models of cellular metabolism, cellular proliferation and scratch wound healing.  Successful completion of these tasks will result in a functional preliminary photomedical treatment system that lays the foundation for in-vivo animal studies of oral cancer or diabetic wound healing treatment paradigms in Phase II of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to make walking both safer and easier for transfemoral amputees. Falling and fear of falling are pervasive in this population. Transfemoral amputees fall at a rate approximately 200 times that of healthy age-matched individuals, and they seek medical attention from falls at the same rate as the institution-living elderly. Such falls result most commonly from a lack of full knee extension in late swing, combined with a lack of knee proprioception, in which case the user enters a non-recoverable knee buckling state shortly after loading. This project proposes a knee prosthesis that provides a powered, motion-controlled knee swing which guarantees full knee extension prior to heel strike, and it therefore substantially reduces the likelihood of a fall. Further, powered knee movement lessens the need for compensatory movements, and therefore the effort required for walking is lessened. As a result, the proposed knee will provide safer and easier walking, enabling users to walk with greater confidence. The prosthesis will be reimbursable under current reimbursement codes and will result in improved mobility, health, and quality of life for end users.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project proposes a novel knee prosthesis that incorporates a hybrid approach to providing the two major functions of a knee prosthesis: stance and swing control. In this device, stance control is provided by a polycentric joint, while swing control utilizes a small motor for assistance. Consequently, the proposed device is called a polycentric swing-assist (PSA) knee. Unlike a passive extension aid employed in a typical polycentric knee, the swing-assist motor is able to aid both flexion in mid swing and extension in late swing. The PSA prosthesis is intended to inject small amounts of power during the swing phase of gait in order to guide the knee through the swing trajectory. Since the assistance is associated with low-torque and low-power movements, the motor, transmission, and battery can be small, lightweight, and quiet relative to a fully-powered knee prosthesis. The goal of this work is to design, construct, and test a PSA knee prototype. The efficacy of the prosthesis prototype will be compared to a commercial knee. The investigators will test whether or not the prosthesis better emulates healthy kinematics through outcome measures such as toe clearance and peak knee flexion across walking speeds.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to help wastewater treatment plants become compliant
    with emerging environmental regulations, while saving energy and without adding
    cost.  It has potential to reduce the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped
    off-site and landfilled by up to 85% as well as completely destroy odors and pathogens.
    \ As a result, the project may also enhance social justice throughout the country.
    \ Currently, low-income and disadvantaged communities inherit waste from other
    communities, sometimes very far away from where the waste originated.  They inherit
    the stench, the vectors (rats, flies, birds) and toxins.  For example, 7% of the
    biosolids produced by New York City end up in Alabama, via trains and trucks.
    \ People living near the landfills and along transportation routes no longer use
    their porch because of the stench.  By improving the economics of a technology
    that destroys organics much better than state-of-the-art technologies, wastewater
    treatment plants will become cleaner, less malodorous and use less energy.  Other
    markets could open as well including clean power and chemical manufacturing. Finally,
    the project may lead to increased hiring of employees over the next three years.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an affordable and reliable process
    to cleanly and completely destroy organic waste, extract more resources and energy
    from sludge and biosolids at wastewater treatment plants while considerably reducing
    the amount of biosolids that need to be shipped off-site for disposal.  This objective
    will be achieved by improving a process that uses water contained within the waste
    to create a hyper oxidative environment.  Similar processes use costly and hazardous
    pure oxygen, are extremely energy intensive, and are plagued with high maintenance
    cost.  By making innovations in energy recovery, the use of air as an oxidant
    instead of oxygen is possible without the large cost associated with having to
    heat and compress an entire air stream- oxygen plus inert nitrogen. Once optimal
    technical conditions for energy recovery are identified, the project will enter
    the design and fabrication phases. The resulting new energy recovery module will
    be added to an existing system. The prototype will be tested for continuous operation.
    New insights into energy recovery will be gained, which will benefit the scientific
    community as a whole.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    proof points behind the novel concept of a hand-held medical robot, i.e. use of
    a medical robot to autonomously perform a task during which neither the robot
    not the patient is fixed in space. The potential outcome of this project is a
    comprehensive line of robotic ultrasound transducers that enable a variety of
    interventional point-of-care robotic applications by enhancing the skills of a
    multitude of clinicians.  As a result, many technically challenging critical procedures
    will no longer be restricted to solely highly trained experts. Applications include
    central vascular access (pediatric and adult), biopsy, regional anesthesiology,
    precision extraction (e.g. thoracentesis), and precision injections (e.g. orthopedic
    biologics), creating an addressable market exceeding $2 billion. Benefits of man-machine
    teaming using hand-held medical robots include faster, simpler procedures that
    can be performed by a much broader group of clinicians, reduced medical complications
    and patient discomfort, and improved hospital infrastructure utilization, ultimately
    benefitting both clinical outcomes and total costs of care. Significant insights
    and implications for other man-machine teaming applications may also result from
    this project, with potential for robotic applications well outside of the medical
    realm. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project centers on demonstrating the
    feasibility of first-of-kind hand-held robotic capabilities for autonomous needle
    placement. This project builds on two existing layers of innovation. First is
    the ability to use real-time ultrasound data to send a needle precisely to a point
    in the body. This differs significantly from other imaging modalities that require
    multiple images from different orientations integrated \"off line.\" Next, this
    is an autonomous and powered system. Once a user selects a target, the needle
    path is calculated and the needle is advanced automatically. This project builds
    the third level of innovation through its research objectives - creating the real-time
    ability to i) recognize and track the target as an object, and ii) make automatic
    robotic corrections to maintain that target during user or patient movement or
    changes in target characteristics. The research involves novel image recognition
    and tracking technology and very precise novel sensing and control loop technology
    that interact in real time to maintain targeting accuracy in a dynamic environment.
    The anticipated technical result is to enable a non-expert clinician to reliably
    enter a clinically challenging \"small\" central blood vessel in a pediatric patient

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project centers on the possibility opened by plasma-activated water in dairy sanitation. Plasma activated water has several advantages: it is reusable and reduces the need to buy, store, and dispose of chemicals, it will not face antimicrobial resistance, unlike chemicals, and could be a faster disinfectant. In addition to replacing chemical disinfectants, plasma activated water could prove to be fast enough to allow for disinfecting the milking unit in-between individual cows, which should reduce the spread of mastitis within a herd, reducing the farmer's costs in terms of medicine, increased labor, and culling. By using plasma activated water as part of a milking system, cleaning could be automated as well as target spores in farm environments. The resulting reduction in costs, infection rate, manual labor & strain, and increase in milk quality, could revolutionize the dairy industry.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to research a method whereby plasma activated water replaces chemical disinfectants used in dairy milking machines. The dairy industry is facing two major problems relating to milking machines: first, a manual labor shortage, and secondly an ever-present threat of mastitis, an infection estimated to cost the industry $1B annually. These two problems come to a head at the milking machine, as current methods require cows to be manually cleaned before milking. The goal of this project is to explore whether plasma activated water could be an effective replacement for teat dips, aiming to design a self-cleaning milking attachment for existing machines, and clean the cows with PAW prior to milking. In Phase I, the focus will be on building a basic prototype to check sanitation capabilities, and compatibility with a farm environment. Future research would include a longer-term study of animals and track infection rates before and after.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will be the research and development of a new class of extremely portable deployable structures that allows easier transportation and simplifies the deployment of bulky structure. This fundamental technology covers a wide variety of potential commercial products including large easily transported rescue equipment and large tents for earthquake and other widespread humanitarian disaster scenarios; large space satellite structures such as antennas and optical arrays; large deployable UAV wings; large volumes for habitation or material storage; piping for water, sewage, oil or gas. This technology can help save lives during disasters, ease the transportation of potable water, sewer and energy with lower construction and deployment costs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I project will entail the systematic analysis and development of a novel highly compact, rapidly deployable composite tube technology. The challenge is to harness and combine the extremely energy dense properties of chemical combustion with a photocuring high-performance structural composite material to create an easily transported structure that can be rapidly deployed.  The project will entail experiments to better understand the polymer material properties and tailor them to the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the combustion. Customization of an adhesive that will combine the necessary viscosity, structural and curing properties. A multiphysics simulation, validated with laboratory experiments, will be used to predict the technology's limitations.  The qualifying components will be utilized in a refined design and evaluated by manufacturers for large scale production. These efforts will culminate in scale prototype construction and testing.

    This STTR Phase I project will develop a transformative platform for inexpensive screening for pancreatic cancer detection, based on profiling of cancer-related proteins from a small blood draw.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, killing over 50,000 each year in the US, and with a five-year survival rate below 7%.  However, currently there are no reliable diagnostic tests for pancreatic cancer, and the great majority of cases are detected at a late stage, with bleak mortality rates as a result.  As cancer is driven fundamentally by a dysregulation of key protein networks, directly measuring the activity of key proteins provides a robust bio-signature for cancer detection. The project will develop a scientifically novel diagnostic technology based on broad protein profiling for the accurate and low cost detection of pancreatic cancer, and thereby shift the therapeutic field of battle to an earlier stage of the disease, where the current treatments can be more effectively harnessed to improve patient outcomes and save lives, avoid unnecessary and ineffective procedures, and generate health system cost savings across the US and elsewhere. Commercialization of this diagnostic platform is expected to drive creation of a substantial enterprise, and related employment and tax-revenues.

    The major innovation of this project is the breakthrough technology for monitoring the state of dozens of cancer-related proteins in biological samples and its application for diagnosing pancreatic cancer from a minute sample of a patient?s blood. The innovative platform has superior levels of sensitivity and accuracy compared to existing technologies, and also offers substantially lower costs, which are critical advantages for the diagnostic application. A further innovation in this project is the development of the analytic engine and the bio-signature knowledge base, that will be used for analysis of the patient?s protein profile.  In this project, the Company will focus on several key technical challenges to develop and validate a 1.0 version of its diagnostic platform for pancreatic cancer detection:  i. identifying a robust, differentiated multi-target, bio-signature for pancreatic cancer; and ii. doing so with an accuracy and at a sufficiently early stage in the cancer emergence and progression to be medically useful. This project will extensively profile biobank samples from various stages of pancreatic cancer and normal patients to generate the differentiated bio-signatures, develop a diagnosis prediction engine to match the bio-signatures and inform diagnoses, and validate those results using additional samples.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop disease resistant soybean varieties that will reduce the substantial losses in agricultural production caused by plant diseases.  Loss to disease can be as high as 40% globally and cost billions of dollars annually. In soybean alone, an estimated $3 billion dollars of production value is lost from plant diseases annually.  In addition, the destruction of crops by plant diseases threatens global food security and has a significant negative impact on the environment due to the use of pesticides. Application of a tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistance strategy in agriculturally important crops will have a major societal impact by protecting crops from devastating diseases for which alternative solutions are not currently available, securing agricultural production, and reducing environmental pollution from agricultural chemicals.  In the future, the goal is to apply the proposed technology to other agriculturally important crops such as corn, rice, and tomato.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to engineer tunable, broad-spectrum disease resistant soybean varieties. In this project, a soybean immune regulatory cassette will be constructed through sequence homology, and then functionally validated by demonstrating pathogen-inducible resistance against various diseases with minimal yield penalty. The methods that will be used in this project include bioinformatic analysis of soybean sequences to identify homologous defense genes and corresponding regulatory elements, molecular cloning, transformation of both Arabidopsis and Soybean plants, and testing the resulting transformant plants to determine levels of resistance to different types of pathogens. Results from this project will be essential for moving forward with larger field trials, which to be accomplished in the Phase II of the project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly lower the cost and expand the number of addressable markets for ice thermal energy storage. Cost effectively storing energy is imperative to a sustainable future. Storage can provide reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, increase the resiliency of the grid to weather events or terrorist attacks, and increase the utilization efficiency of existing assets, deferring costly upgrades. Today, ice thermal storage systems help building owners shift cooling loads from costly peak hours to when electricity is less expensive. Unfortunately the upfront cost of these systems, driven by the large cost of the cooling coil used to generate ice, prevents adoption from many users and has unduly restricted the number of addressable markets for ice thermal storage. Elimination of ice buildup on the cooling coil would reduce the size of the coil, and more importantly significantly lower the cost of these systems. Low-cost ice thermal energy storage could greatly improve the economics for long-duration energy storage technologies such as pumped thermal energy storage.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to translate the discovery of surfaces with zero ice adhesion into a cooling coil that can be integrated into a functioning ice thermal energy storage system. In order to repel ice, these surfaces require complete submersion in an immiscible oil phase, making coil geometry and overall system development challenging. At the beginning of this project, various plate and tube based cooling coil geometries will be systematically prototyped and refined, measuring the freezing and melting heat transfer efficiencies. Different formulations of the surface coating will be tested as well. The most promising candidate geometries will be charged and discharged over multiple cycles as part of an ice thermal energy storage system. The results from cycling will be compared to conventional ice-on-coil technology using metrics such as energy density and heat transfer efficiency. An ice shedding cooling coil, at less than a third of the size of an ice-on-coil system, is expected to deliver improved cooling performance. Demonstration of an ice shedding cooling coil in a functioning ice thermal energy storage system will prove the technology?s readiness to scale.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Grid-scale electricity storage from waste heat'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative imaging device that applies tactile sensing to the surface detection of vertebrae to help clinicians place needles for the nearly 13 million diagnostic and therapeutic spinal punctures performed in the United States each year. The standard of care involves manual palpation of the back to estimate a vertebral gap for needle insertion. This technique is highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple attempts, which lead to pain and complications, unpredictable procedure times, poor throughput, and high rates of referrals to radiology for fluoroscopic guidance. By offering an accurate means of localizing bony landmarks, this project will enable successful insertion in fewer attempts, thereby improving clinical outcomes and reducing costs across the $3.2 million market, including emergency medicine, neurology, anesthesiology, and pain medicine. The device can also be introduced for training and to reduce errors in clinical testing of intrathecal drugs; and can increase procedure access by offering an alternative, bedside solution for challenging cases. To date, tactile imaging has only been applied clinically to soft-tissue evaluations. This project will pave the way for expanded use of this low-cost, non-radiative modality; to possibly replace palpation for other procedures, such as joint injections and thoracenteses.

    The innovation is the first standalone, clinical tactile imager. Its imaging subsystem comprises a sensitive, high-resolution pressure-sensing array, which detects vertebral landmarks when pressed against the back, and communicates them as a 2D pressure map to an integrated display. The device also includes a novel needle guide, which allows for flexible and reliable insertion. Positive gap localization has been verified in early development. This project will first confirm accurate insertion relative to imaging output by characterizing the relationship between guide and visualized-landmark locations, and by developing a mechanism to stabilize the device over unpredictable lumbar curvatures. Next, 2D pressure information will be evolved into an optimally robust and intuitive image. Advanced algorithms will be developed to detect, track, and highlight features of interest; and to understand and predict device use across cases. At each stage, the device will be tested on phantoms and through IRB testing on anesthesiology patients. Performance will be evaluated across anatomical variations, and compared with the standard of care. The resulting device will have demonstrated feasibility as a comprehensive spinal-puncture localization and insertion solution, rendering it suitable for further development and testing toward a regulatory submission, and providing compelling evidence for continued optimization in Phase II.

    This STTR Phase 1 project seeks to develop an automated system that would significantly increase the speed and accuracy of biopsy assessments at the point of care. The proposed technology eliminates extensive manual tissue processing steps and generates digital images of fresh biopsies that look just like standard pathology slides. The imaging can be performed in seconds, thus improving the efficiency of biopsy assessments at the point of care. Rapid, whole fresh biopsy imaging also improves evaluation accuracy while maximally preserving tissue for further testing and facilitating remote pathology consultation. With over five million patients in the United States undergoing biopsy procedures each year, and one in five of those patients returning for repeat procedures due to inaccuracies in biopsy assessments, an increase in accuracy and procedure speed could have a profound impact. This could lead to decreases in patient procedure time and decreases in repeat procedure rates, preventing unnecessary, painful, and invasive repeat biopsy procedures. With an estimated 1.6 billion USD spend on repeat procedures per year, this would also represent a significant decrease in financial burden on patients. In addition, due to the decrease in time per procedure, this could increase procedure throughput for hospitals, thus increasing hospital revenue potential. Finally, by producing remotely viewable images, this system could be utilized in a remote pathology setting at underserved communities within the US.

    This STTR Phase I project seeks to develop an automated sample processing and tissue pathology imaging system that delivers biopsy-to-image in a completely automated manner on fully-intact fresh tissues within five minutes of tissue removal.  Through integration with the previously developed Video-Rate Structured Illumination Microscopy (VR-SIM) system as the integrated optical sectioning modality, and using novel fluorescence dye combinations that recapitulate gold-standard histology,  the throughput, efficiency, and accuracy of biopsy evaluation can be improved while maximally preserving tissue for downstream processing and readily facilitating telepathology consultation. Preliminary work in multiple fresh tissue preparations, including core-needle biopsies and whole surgical resections,  indicates that the technology and method can deliver high image quality and diagnostic accuracy in short, clinically-relevant timeframes. A prototype of an automated, disposable cartridge system for biopsy staining and imaging for effortless integration with VR-SIM imaging will be developed. Image quality will be optimized at the highest optical sectioning power to be equivalent to physically-sectioned tissues, using polarization-gated VR-SIM and novel immersion media. ADPL workflow testing, validation of diagnostic image quality, and verification of compatibility with downstream analysis in human biopsy samples will be completed.

    demonstrate the commercial feasibility of a manufacturing platform for functionalizing
    textile materials with smart functionality such as for wearable smart garments
    developed out of the NSF funded ASSIST Engineering Research Center for Self-powered
    Wearable Nanosystems. Smart garments have been touted as the next sensing platform
    for acquiring biometrics such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, or heart rate
    variability. However, mass adoption has been difficult due to the high production
    cost, leading to a small market segment within the greater wearable technology
    market. As demonstrated by our customer discovery through the NSF I-Corps program
    in Fall 2016, the biggest barrier to adoption is the production cost. This project
    seeks to decrease the cost by 5x and decrease production time by 36x, enabling
    this market segment to grow for applications in health & wellness, healthcare,
    and beyond. By employing high-throughput direct-write printing and deposition
    of functional dielectric and conductive materials from the printed electronics
    space, high-value data generating devices such as smart garments can be manufactured
    in a single step bridging established practices within the textile and electronics
    industry resulting in automated textile electronics. Novel materials will be explored
    to impart functionalities on existing textiles with our manufacturing platform.
    \n\nThe broader impact of this project is to create a single manufacturing platform
    that marginalizes the cost of production for textile electronics such as smart
    garments and demonstrate minimum viable product (MVP) solutions for stakeholders
    within the value chain of smart textiles. The proposed innovation combines developments
    from 3D printing, printed electronics, and textile science to create disruptive
    advancements in the emerging field of smart textiles and textile electronics,
    creating new knowledge and commercial innovations. Lastly, manufacturing within
    the USA has seen a resurgence due to value-added technical textiles manufacturing
    being brought back. An ancillary broader impact of this project is to serve as
    a driver for value-added smart garment manufacturing technologies to be employed
    for USA manufacturing. Success of this project's vision will allow for low-cost
    smart textiles to usher in a paradigm shift for the textiles industry, allowing
    for a multitude of use-cases and innovative business models to proliferate, ultimately
    increasing the well-being of billions of people around the world.\n\nThis award

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project lies in helping more amputees walk safely with less effort. There are approximately 800,000 individuals living with a major lower limb amputation, and this number is growing largely due to diabetes. For 50,000 amputees each year who need a new prosthetic knee, two options exist:  learn to use a traditional prosthetic knee or attempt to obtain a high-tech, computer-controlled knee. The former require the amputee learn and execute specific technique(s) to walk safely, while the latter do so automatically but cost $30,000 to $100,000 and require physical qualification, greatly limiting their availability. The novel prosthetic knee developed here offers stability automatically, regardless of amputee technique. It prevents buckling while simultaneously allowing the user to walk safely with whatever leg motions the user is able to generate. Since it requires no electronics or power, it is available to all amputees regardless of ability, and at a fraction of the cost of high-tech knees. Amputees will be able to walk farther with less effort, improving health and quality of life, and easing caregiver burden. Additionally, this design could be adapted for use in orthotic, robotic or exoskeletal systems.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and test a novel prosthetic knee. Funding would be used to build prototypes and conduct mechanical, analytical and destructive testing. This testing is necessary to demonstrate that the design is feasible, safe for humans, and deserving of further development with amputees. An independent engineering design review will be obtained, prototypes will then be bench tested for function in a biomechanics lab, and an independent lab will provide destructive testing to prove ultimate strength of the device for comparison against known standards. The anticipated technical results include proof that the device can support the weight of a 300lb person, and quantitative evidence that the device will afford intuitive and universally available stability to amputees through its innovative swing- and stance-phase functionality. This work would advance the knowledge of prosthetics, rehabilitation and bipedal locomotion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to reduce the power required to cool the data and telecommunications centers that drive the internet age. Currently nearly 2.0% of the energy consumed in the United States is used to run such data centers and, often, half of this is used for cooling. The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will also be reduced. Longer term this technology can be adapted to increasing the efficiency of air-conditioning/refrigeration and power generation. Commercially, the computational fluid dynamics software market the product will compete in is projected to grow from $1.3 billion at present to over $2 billion by 2022. It will also stimulate the growth of the manufacture of specialty heat sinks with optimal geometries for efficient thermal management.

    This intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is based on proposing to hybridize three common numerical methods, i.e., computational fluid dynamics (CFD), flow network modeling (FNM) and multi-variable optimization (MVO), a non-trivial objective. The result will be a software platform that can accurately and simultaneously optimize the geometry of an array of heat sinks found in various types of circuit packs, e.g., blade servers in data centers. This is not possible with CFD alone as it is too slow and it is not possible with FNM alone as it is not sufficiently accurate. The method of the hybrid approach to preserve the accuracy of CFD is to embed pre-computed, non-dimensional look-up tables of flow and thermal resistances from CFD simulations in an FNM. The software will accommodate both single-phase flows of air and water and evaporating/boiling flows of water and refrigerant, which requires modeling complex heat, mass and momentum transport phenomena. Experiments will validate its accuracy on thermal mock-ups of circuit packs.

    This SBIR Phase I project will help advance the health and welfare of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease affecting nearly 1 million people in the United States. A non-invasive, wearable retinal imaging device will be developed for at-home patient use that detects changes in MS disease activity, enabling patients and their physicians to track responses to treatment and detect disease flare-ups between clinical visits. Early detection and proper treatment of MS is crucial to reducing the risk of disease progression and disability. Current practice relies on infrequent neurological and radiological exams to assess changes in disease activity and treatment efficacy. However, there is currently no way to monitor MS in real time between these visits. Research relating retinal pathology to MS processes in the brain demonstrate that retinal imaging can provide early detection of disease events, offering an alternative monitoring pathway. This device will thus help reduce increases in patient healthcare costs associated with increasing disability, and potentially impact the research and care of patients with other brain conditions that manifest in the retina, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and addiction. Following FDA approval, the device will be sold to MS patients, neurologists, and researchers.

    This project will yield a novel retinal imaging device that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) to assess retinal biomarkers associated with MS progression. While OCT and FAF are widely-used modalities for imaging the retina, the proposed device differentiates itself from current technologies in that it is specifically designed for use by MS patients at home. This will include a ruggedized, ergonomic, and wearable design suited for those who suffer from low mobility and other symptoms that make trips to a clinic difficult. Patients will use the device briefly once a week, during which time retinal images will be automatically acquired, analyzed, and sent to a physician for remote review. As such, it will further increase engagement between patients and physicians by making patients more proactively involved in their disease management. For this project, the following objectives are planned: 1) Develop the OCT component of the device to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of layers in a healthy tissue-mimicking phantom retina, 2) Develop the FAF component of the device, and 3) Validate the device?s ability to acquire high-resolution and repeatable images of retinal layer thicknesses and autofluorescence in post-mortem retinas from MS patients and healthy individuals.

    This SBIR Phase I project will explore the technical, commercial, and educational potentials of bringing augmented reality binocular kiosks to public locations and their ability to create lasting impact on the public's understanding of a place. The proposed research and development phase will focus on the deployment and field testing of a collection of prototypes with partner locations, and examine their efficacy at engaging and informing visitors of those sites. The broader significance of the project is the development of an information device and ecosystem that gives the public a better understanding of notable places and the greater physical world. Deployments will be able to visualize a variety of site-specific data, from environmental conditions, to geological formations and landmark navigation. Potential revenue can be generated in partnership with locations, allowing for sustainable long-term engagements between the project and a site. Direct economic impact is brought to a location and its surroundings through increased foot traffic and the encouragement of additional exploration of a space.


    The innovation being proposed is stereoscopic wide-field-of-view see-through augmented reality viewers in the form of landscape binocular kiosks designed to give public spaces a way to engage visitors with the natural, scientific, and historic features of that location. In addition to displaying immersive media experiences optically overlaid onto a view of the real world, this project creates a distributed media network on that location to share data and content for remote viewing and analysis. Goals and scope of research include durability testing of the devices in prolonged public exposure, effectiveness of the user interface and software tools, understanding the range and bandwidth of device-to-device communication, and optimization of the optical, electromechanical, and sensor components. Methods and approaches will include the field testing of prototype units with partner locations, and using survey and analysis techniques to evaluate the overall quantitative and qualitative efficacy of the intervention at those sites.

    oxygen mapping in vitro and in vivo. The field of tissue engineering regenerative
    medicine combines the principles of the life sciences, cell biology, and engineering
    to create functional tissues and organs that can be used for replacing damaged
    tissues and organs. The public health benefit of replacing damaged tissues and
    organs is at par with curing cancer. Almost every part of the human body has been
    considered for replacement. Tissue engineering strives to solve arthritis, Type

    medical problems by replacing or restoring damaged tissues or organs with artificial
    functional tissues. This project will address the problem of poor oxygen transport
    in artificial tissue grafts, which is one of the major causes of tissue failure,
    by developing an oxygen imaging instrument to generate three-dimensional in situ
    oxygen maps. This instrument will allow scientists to assess oxygen environment
    over the time of graft production and upon implantation and develop better artificial
    tissues. The oxygen imager uses cutting-edge radiofrequency and magnet technology
    and will help create high-tech jobs in the Midwest. \n\nThe oxygen imager will
    be based on the innovative noninvasive electron paramagnetic resonance oxygen
    imaging (EPROI) technology. EPROI uses an injectable water-soluble, non-toxic
    contrast agent, trityl that has oxygen-dependent relaxation rates. EPROI provides
    absolute partial oxygen pressure (pO2) maps with high accuracy (~ 1 torr) within
    1-10 minutes. The oxygen imager will be equipped with a 25 mT magnet and ~720
    MHz electronics suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo oxygen imaging.
    The instrument will have user-friendly software for image acquisition, image registration,
    data processing and analysis. This project will develop the magnet with the top
    loading of samples along with temperature and gas controlled bioreactor sample
    chamber for in vitro oxygen mapping of artificial tissues. The robustness and
    performance of the imager will be tested by acquiring oxygen maps of cell-seeded
    biomaterials. It is expected that the oxygen imager will become an essential tool
    in tissue engineering labs of academic institutions and biotech companies and
    will have a major impact on the successful development of regenerative medicine
    therapies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    new capacitor technology based on kilohertz high-frequency supercapacitor, called
    AC-Supercap, aiming to replace conventional aluminum electrolytic capacitors (AECs)
    for a vast range of electronic and power systems. Capacitors are an essential
    component used in electronic devices, in power supplies driving electrical machines,
    appliances and instruments, as well as in power conversion and conditioning systems
    used for renewable energy generation. In the consumer electronics sector, miniaturization
    and low-profile or even flexible packaging, and higher power efficiency are some
    of the key demands. In the power system and other power-demanding industry sectors,
    large capacitance, large ripple current absorption, and high temperature rating
    are the key requirements. With the emergence of distributed wireless sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT), pulse energy storage and generation will be necessary
    as well. AC-Supercap, with its much better performance than current solutions,
    is anticipated to better serve the needs of broad range of customers. Upon the
    success of this technology, there will also be tremendous impact on the local
    ecosystem and regional community of West Texas. \n\nThis Small Business Technology
    Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of producing
    AC-Supercap as high-performance alternating current (AC) filtering capacitors
    for power modules, on-board application, or as compact and efficient pulse power
    storage. Conventional AECs, limited by their low capacitance density, bulky size,
    poor lifetime, large equivalent series resistance, and polarity sensitivity cannot
    meet technical needs well. To achieve AC-Supercaps with both large capacitance
    density and high-frequency response, two contradictory requirements, and nanostructured
    electrode engineering will be investigated. To produce a compact capacitor with
    a large voltage rating and capacitance, multicell integration will be optimally
    designed and demonstrated, which is crucial considering the intrinsic low voltage
    rating of a single cell. The proposed innovative solutions to these technical
    challenges will de-risk the AC-Supercap product prototyping in the following project
    phases to make ready the technology for commercialization. These research activities
    will advance the scientific understanding and technological development of nanostructured
    electrode process and property control, multicell integration design, and particularly
    AC-Supercap technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project aims at developing a roll-to-roll, solid-state, continuous process for manufacturing nanocellular thermoplastic films with open (interconnected) or closed (not interconnected) cells of the order 10-100 nm and as much as 50% porosity. The initial application of this proposed project is an improved Lithium-ion battery separator comprising a nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film of 10-25-micron thickness with uniformly distributed interconnected 10-50 nm size cells. The nanoporous PEI separator, which has significantly higher heat resistance than current polyolefin-based separators, addresses a very urgent safety issue, i.e., batteries exploding and causing fire due to thermal instability of the separator. Moreover, compared to the current multi-step process for fabricating battery separators, this continuous process will have higher productivity thereby increasing the nation's global competitiveness in battery manufacturing. The total addressable global market for separators used in both primary (single-use) and secondary (rechargeable) lithium batteries is projected to be $1.65 billion by 2020 growing at 4.7%. This innovative research project will contribute to new knowledge in the areas of gas diffusion and cell nucleation in thermoplastic polymeric films and enable development, characterization and application of a whole new class of solid-state nanocellular polymer films.

    The intellectual merit of this project resides in the development of a manufacturing process that brings together interdisciplinary knowledge to synthesize and characterize nanostructures under various process conditions. This new knowledge will advance the field of nanomanufacturing and will be used to optimize processes towards commercialization targets. There are two technical challenges: (i) the dynamic seal concept, which has been proven in a 250-micron thick polymer film but not for a film 10-20 times lower in thickness; and (ii) maintaining enough gas concentration during the cell nucleation and growth to create nano-sized cells. The goals of this project are to: (a) establish the feasibility of a roll-to-roll process operating at a minimum speed of 1 meter/minute to produce nanocellular thermoplastic films and (b) develop a 100-mm wide, 10-25 micron thick nanoporous polyetherimide (PEI) film having the desired properties and nanostructure profile for a Li-ion battery separator application. These two goals will be achieved by implementing the dynamic seal technology to process a 100-mm wide film on a continuous basis and immediately heating the film to create nanocells.

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will create an educational technology that accelerates the acquisition of foundational English language skills by children (4 to 10 years old), by melding English and Spanish language instruction, delivered via a personalized digital learning platform. Using state-of-the-art text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines, students that are English Language Learners (ELL) will engage in deliberate literacy practice across the four modalities of language (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Over the last decade, the number of ELL students enrolling in public schools has steadily increased while there remains a shortage of bilingual or certified ELL teachers. Technology can help these teachers to personalize instruction and extend the school day which in turn increases engaged learning time. Achieving college and career readiness is an economic imperative for all students, especially ELL students given the importance of English communication skills to career success. While developing technologies for use in classrooms by young children can be a risky proposition due to the nature of the modern classroom, the reward far outweighs the risk. This project will produce a high-impact technology solution designed for young children that integrates the latest text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies and is grounded in sound research about language skill acquisition across the four modalities.

    The key innovation of this SBIR Phase 1 project is a plurilinguistic (e.g., Spanish and English) approach to literacy development across the four modalities of language (e.g., reading, writing, speaking, listening) where young students (aged 4-10 years old) are immersed in personalized learning experiences specifically tailored to support and accelerate language development. The first research goal is to test the feasibility for using and adapting proprietary English and Spanish language text-to-speech and speech-to-text engines with young children. The second research goal is to examine the impact of a dual-language personalized learning platform on children?s acquisition of foundational listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Participants will be ELL students whose first language is Spanish. The research is based on a plurilinguistic framework for second language acquisition; researchers hypothesize that a dual-language application that leverages students' first language to learn English will score significantly higher on independent measures of foundational literacy skills and self-efficacy for learning compared to students who are using an English-only personalized learning application. A mechanism of growth may be the amount of time students are immersed in deliberate practice of literacy skills. A dual-language personalized learning platform has the potential to extend teacher-led literacy instruction and increase the amount of time students spend engaged in learning English.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a shift towards both accuracy and affordability
    within the world of energy sub-metering.  This metering system will have a dramatic
    impact on the market for submetering commercial real estate. By drastically reducing
    the cost and knowledge hurdles associated with accurate submetering and bringing
    the costs of submetering in line with value, this technology opens the door for
    a mass-market approach to circuit-level energy use data. The market for this commercial
    submetering is expected to reach $2.5 billion annually within six years, but could
    grow substantially larger with the introduction of low-cost, high-accuracy technologies.
    Additionally, it is estimated that access to metering data alone can reduce energy
    consumption within a building between 5% and 15%, meaning a wide deployment of
    these technologies could have wide-reaching environmental and energy security
    benefits.  \n\nThe proposed project will advance the state-of-the-art in true
    power metering by providing revenue quality AC power submetering using an energy-harvesting,
    as opposed to plug-in, design. Doing so requires fundamental improvements in circuit
    design, embedded software architecture and signal analysis. The result is a self-contained
    system that drastically reduces deployment and installation costs. This project
    will simplify the system implementation and reduce the cost of production, and
    the ability for Triumvi meters to share data and, more importantly, energy harvested.
    Specific key technical objectives include creating a daisy-chain framework through
    which individual nodes within a metering system can share energy and data, improving
    accuracy in the myriad of potential field conditions, and creating a system of
    runtime-diagnostics to identify, and fix, human error in real time. Study and
    pursuit of these objectives will take place both in the lab, as well is in the
    field, where installation and accuracy can be benchmarked against conventional
    hardwired metering solutions.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual

    The broader market impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to foster the mainstream use of decentralized database solutions in place of centrally owned and operated data centers and cloud services offered by companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Data security breaches involving tens or hundreds of millions of customers are now commonplace, as are high-profile news stories related to questionable uses of customer-supplied data.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to solve the key problem of developing a new network protocol that allows for a low-latency, secure, persistent and highly-available, decentralized No-SQL database which may operate at Internet scale. Key objectives include: development of a novel P2P overlay network which combines a zero-hop Distributed Hash Table (DHT) as a base routing layer and any number of traditional Kademlia DHTs as application specific leaf networks, all of which may communicate through a variety of transport protocols; constructing a new proof-of-space for use  both as the consensus layer of a proof-of-space blockchain and as a proof-of-capacity for storage nodes; creating a secure Decentralized Storage Network utilizing a proof of replication based on verifiable delay functions; and implementing and testing the protocol across common host devices and client runtimes. The end goal of the project is to validate the technical feasibility, scalability, and market interest for the subspace protocol.

    Transfer (STTR) project will be a low-cost, high-performance nanofiltration membrane
    technology for removing oils, pollutants, and organic materials from highly contaminated
    wastewater. Industrial activity in the U.S. produces more than 25 billion gallons
    of wastewater every day, much of contaminated with oils, greases, solvents, and
    other harmful chemical compounds. Existing filtration membranes are easily clogged
    and damaged by these oily materials, suffering a rapid decline in performance.
    Safely processing this wastewater by conventional means costs U.S. industrial
    facilities more than $40B per year. A breakthrough in nanofiltration technology
    will allow industries across the country - such as food processors, landfills,

    \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop the technology and processes
    to produce commercial-scale anti-fouling nanofiltration membranes for use with
    highly contaminated industrial wastewater. The project will combine large-scale
    manufacturing techniques such as high-precision spray coating with a novel chemistry
    platform based on zwitterionic copolymers to produce high-performance, low-cost
    membranes. These polymers exhibit extraordinary resistance to organic fouling
    as well as pore self-assembly at the nanometer scale. To achieve the required
    performance, the project will develop the process and materials to achieve a thickness
    of less than one micron in the selective layer of a thin-film composite. Currently,
    layers of this thickness are only achievable using in-situ polymerization of nylon-based
    polymers, which are costly, have low permeability, and are intolerant of oxidizing
    conditions. This project will overcome these limitations by exploiting the unique
    self-assembly behavior of zwitterionic copolymers to achieve ultrathin, uniformly
    porous films in both flat sheet and hollow fiber forms. The project will furthermore
    demonstrate the chemical robustness of these membranes with accelerated lifecycle

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to place the power of genetic identification in the hands of those who need it, at the front lines of conservation. The DNA Barcode Scanner will enable anyone, anywhere, to perform a low-cost, rapid, automated DNA test to validate the identity of a tissue sample, without specialized training, expensive lab-based equipment, reagents, or reliable power, where it is needed most - in the field. This technological advance has the potential to revolutionize species identification to prevent species extinction, to protect consumers and our food supply, and to combat threats to global biodiversity. The innovation's commercial potential includes improving the safety and sustainability of our supply chains, combatting costly environmental fraud, and detecting pests and pathogens that threaten our nation's economy, security, and health. The initial market opportunity is to address unmet demand from seafood suppliers, distributors, and retailers; government regulators and enforcement agents; and conservation and natural resources entities, for increased transparency and integrity of seafood supply chains by ending seafood mislabeling and fraud, which occurs in over 30% the $17.1 billion dollar U.S. seafood market and is worth up to $250,000 per illegal import.

    The proposed project will develop the customizable DNA collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge that enables a user to go from tissue sample to species identification in a single device. This project focuses on the scientific and technical challenge of automating sample preparation. The company's goal is to create an integrated device that will validate seafood products (our first market) from sample collection to DNA extraction, DNA amplification, and, ultimately, species identification. The goals of this project are to 1) determine a reliable and intuitive method for collecting DNA from a seafood product and create a prototype collection tool, 2) prototype an easy-to-use and highly flexible DNA extraction and sample preparation component to provide DNA suitable for analysis, and 3) fully integrate microfluidic processes and molecular chemistry (DNA amplification and analysis) with clear validation of multiple species. They will design and test several prototypes of the collection, extraction, and amplification cartridge and test these with users to identify the most robust and simplest method for delivering confident species identification. Their objective is to deliver a fully functional prototype that is intuitive for users and can perform a seafood species validation test in multiple field environments.

    This STTR Phase I project aims to pioneer a novel approach for the sustained delivery of peptide therapeutics using nano-composite microparticles. Peptide therapeutics tend to suffer from rapid enzymatic degradation and clearance, with half-lives on the order of minutes, and require frequent injections. The goal of a sustained release formulation is to reduce the frequency of injections by slowly releasing the therapeutic over a period of weeks to months. This will result in improved patient compliance and quality of life. Patient non-compliance is an economic burden that is estimated to cost the healthcare system over $100 billion/year. The lack of commercial success of existing sustained release technologies is due to low loading efficiencies, lack of controlled release at higher loading, and complex manufacturing. These limitations can be overcome with the newly-developed inverse Flash NanoPrecipitation (iFNP) process to produce nano-composite microparticles. This project aims to develop and test a once-monthly injectable formulation of a peptide therapeutic for type 2 diabetes that is currently injected daily. This research will aid in the understanding of the fundamental materials science and engineering principles that control therapeutic release from nano-composite microparticles. The rules for controlling release will apply broadly to other peptides, and this research will help to more rapidly develop future long-acting formulations.

    Current methods to produce peptide-loaded microparticles suffer from low drug loadings and poor encapsulation efficiencies, two of the most important factors for commercial viability. In contrast to existing methods, the iFNP technology allows for the assembly of nanoparticles with peptide loadings greater than 50wt% and encapsulation efficiencies greater than 90% in a fully scalable process. The nanoparticles are then assembled into microparticles to create the final sustained release formulation. Each drug-containing pore inside the microparticle is surrounded by a dense hydrophobic polymer layer which allows for therapeutic loadings 10x higher than competing technologies. The iFNP process has been demonstrated on a number of proof-of-concept molecules. In this project, iFNP will be used to produce a formulation of a peptide for diabetes therapy with a month-long release profile. The first goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the physical parameters that control the peptide stability and release. Supporting this goal, the peptide will be formulated with polymers of varying glass transition temperatures and degradation rates, and the release profiles will be measured in vitro. The efficacy of the optimal in vitro formulation will then be tested in a rat model. These studies are an important step in developing a commercial product that can positively impact patient care.

    The?broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is on renewable electricity production by large scale utilities. Today large scale solar generation (the majority of all solar energy) is almost exclusively by large farms of photovoltaic (PV) panels made from silicon cells, as used also for rooftop solar. The research is aimed at enhancing scientific and technological understanding of an alternative approach that exploits a different, much more efficient type of PV cell.? It promises lower cost electricity in sunny climates around the world, from longer lived plants using less land. The potential societal impact is broader adoption of solar electricity both in the US and across the world, and thus reduced global pollution. The commercial impact of the project is also huge. In the targeted global market, $30 billion now is spent annually on new solar installations and an increase to $100 billion is projected. This is an opportunity for the US to re-establish itself as a world leader in solar manufacturing, of both the different PV cells that underlie our approach, and the optical and mechanical systems that are the target of this research and are key to cost reduction.?

    The proposed project will explore a new approach to solar electricity generation, using advanced photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight into electricity with twice the efficiency of silicon PV panels. The innovation is in the system used to focus sunlight on the cells as needed?for highest efficiency at lowest cost. The advanced PV cells themselves have already been developed for spacecraft, but previous efforts to commercialize them for ground use have failed, because the systems needed to provide concentrated sunlight were too expensive. The research will be directed to developing, building and testing the two innovative elements critical to a complete, low cost system: 1) Small glass lens arrays used at the focus of large dish reflectors to apportion sunlight equally onto individual small cells. Existing commercial glass molding methods do not yield arrays of the size and precision needed; a new molding method tailored specifically for the task will be developed. 2) A novel mechanical structure will be developed to orient the mirrors toward the sun throughout the day with minimal use of steel, by employing an efficient spaceframe structure turning on a ground track, and a sensor-feedback system to eliminate conventional, heavy, rigid bearings.

    Research (SBIR) project is to improve the current spraying practices in agriculture.
    Inefficient crop spraying causes drift which can lead to crop damage or unwanted
    pesticide use in neighboring non-target crop areas. It may contaminate nearby
    bodies of water or be an issue for human health.  Our company would solve this
    through the implementation of a closed loop sensor system which would remotely
    determine the efficiency of sprayer machines and the spray pattern of the material
    continuously and in real time. Farmers will benefit through reduced costs of wasted
    materials resulting from over-spraying, while feeling safe against pest and fungus
    infestation resulting from under-spraying. The initial intended customers are
    large orchards, vineyards and tree farms. Those farmers generally use airblast
    sprayers which are highly inefficient and waste about 45% of the material. Those
    chemicals either hit the ground and contaminate it or pollute the air.  An owner
    of a large farm that implements our proposed device will save a significant amount
    on chemical costs and also avoids the consequences due to drift of chemicals onto
    neighboring farms, public roads, or non-agricultural areas. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposes to introduce a new technology to the agricultural sector. This
    technology has been previously built for complex and sophisticated applications
    in mostly academia and government sectors. We look to provide a new functionality
    while reducing the size and cost of the technology. It would be used as a new
    and improved method of calibration, replacing a tedious and often ignored current
    process. Furthermore, the sensor would be integrated as a closed loop system for
    autonomous sprayer adjustments. A complete software solution would accompany the
    hardware in order to make it approachable to the non-scientific community. This

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is increased revenue and processing potential for scrap recyclers in the US. The artificially-intelligent algorithm designed in this project will enable domestic scrap processors to become more competitive within the material supply chain by giving them the ability to adapt, in real-time, to an ever-changing material consumption climate. With unstable international commodity trade, US scrap processors must reduce reliance on exporting low-value scrap to maintain profitable business models. Additionally, US scrap must exercise optimal processing schedules to prevent scrap surplus domestically while providing consumers with recycled products that are functionally equivalent to new products. The latter offers an environmentally-friendly scrap-to-product option that reduces the energy required for production and the amount of harmful CO2 released. Aluminum scrap recycling has been practiced for decades; however, the majority of post-consumer scrap is downcycled leaving revenue and environmental benefits untapped. Non-ferrous auto-shred was, on average, sold for $0.33/lb. less than its actual value in 2017, which equates to nearly $1 billion in opportunity cost. Artificially intelligent sorting systems will enable scrap processors to reach higher profit margins and meet environmental goals.

    The proposed project will completely automate scrap sortation. The advent of multi-sort capability encourages the need for preliminary research to identify how to operate sensor-based sorters optimally. Artificial intelligence can meet this need. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of an artificially-intelligent algorithm that is capable of optimizing scrap sortation in real-time. The research objectives include:&#8239;(1) identify all data sources in the scrap recycling process that &#8239;can &#8239;influence intelligent decision making (2)&#8239;design a database to host identified data sources such as compositional, market, inventory, and sales data and (3) design a customized artificially-intelligent algorithm for the&#8239; scrap &#8239;recycling industry to develop sorting criteria in real-time. To meet these objectives, a dynamic material flow model will be designed to analyze and host all relevant sensor, market, and experimental data streams to minimize data pre-processing requirements. Concurrently, aluminum scrap will be characterized to investigate how frequently and to what degree composition fluctuates. The database that hosts all supportive data streams will be designed to store and integrate all relevant data streams seamlessly. Finally, using an 80/20 training/testing data split with 5-fold cross-validation, the machine learning algorithm will be selected and optimized to provide the lowest error rate for suggested sorting criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it will reskill those being displaced by the disruption caused by the impending AI and automation that is sweeping every industry. By providing training and fully integrated career services platforms at significantly lower cost than traditional models, Expercoin Republics will make education more accessible to organizations seeking to upskill their employees and professionals looking to reskill. According to Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen, 50% of all American colleges are bound for bankruptcy in the next few decades. Due to the rapid pace of technological change and new employment requirements, we are moving away from credentialing to continuous learning. This project will allow organizations of all kinds to use its protocol to create expert networks and content platforms, while leveraging tokens to reward participation among their users.  400 to 800 million people globally need to be reskilled. This is estimated to translate to $8.5 trillion in unrealized revenue due to lack of talent by 2030.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to embrace a novel intellectual approach and business model that empowers employees and employers through upskilling, continuous learning, and skill verification. The mission of Expercoin Republics is to instantly allow anyone to create a specialized community with marketplaces for training, assessments, mentorship and work opportunities. Expercoin will use blockchain to create decentralized autonomous organizations that advance learning and facilitate employment through the creation of thousands of specialized learning communities. A notable achievement of Expercoin would be to create the underlying infrastructure that helps businesses and governments launch learning economies that consist of self-regulated decentralized entities with features such as transparent voting, effective governance, fraud adjudication, spam prevention, account verification and rewards. An Expercoin token will provide a wide range of functions necessary to create a decentralized economy that is not governed by any central authority.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project addresses the immediate need to develop advanced air conditioning technology that increases energy efficiency and will have a significant and positive impact on reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions. As Room Air Conditioning (RAC) demand increases by an estimated 5x over the next 30 years, it is crucial that newly established scientific and technological approaches be developed which lessen the requirement of 'peaker' power plants to supply electricity for their operation. Nativus is engineering an energy-efficient 12,000 BTU Room Air Conditioner (RAC) for residential and light-commercial consumers, capable of cooling 500 ft2. Through a complete architectural redesign, our proprietary technology offers customers a solution to their air conditioning needs which is cheaper to operate, quieter, filters the air, and is easier to install than currently available commercial offerings.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, rotating air conditioning design which combines the main components of an air conditioner into a single, packaged device to drastically increase air conditioner performance.  The roughly one billion air conditioners in operation globally operate at 5-10% of their theoretical ultimate Carnot efficiency, as industry focuses on "first-cost" and has not demonstrated meaningful, radical improvements since the inception of the air conditioner. The current state-of-the-art technology in the HVAC industry is based upon the 'fan plus finned-tube' (FPFT) Heat Exchanger in which a fan blows air across either hot or cold heat exchanger fins. This architecture results in the formation of an insulative 'boundary layer', severely degrading heat exchanger performance. Through the use of one high-efficiency motor, instead of two or three motors commonly found on state-of-the-art technology, our proprietary design rotationally-shears the boundary layer from the surface of the heat exchanger, thereby increasing efficiency while decreasing power consumption. Our research objectives include air conditioner component and system-level validation, supported by three milestones which include Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) performance validation, system reliability through prototype testing, and economic analysis.  The tasks involved in our project include design, manufacture, assemble, and testing of a complete system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to increase yields and save irrigation water and costs for farmers of perennial crops and high intensity annual crops.  In order to maximize yields while simultaneously minimizing irrigation water usage, farmers need to understand, predict, and manage plant water stress, which is the yield reducing stress plants undergo when they struggle to draw water from the soil.  If successful, this project will demonstrate to farmers that low-cost measurement and forecasting of plant water stress is possible, and that Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendations for irrigation scheduling reduce water and energy usage, eliminate plant water stress, and increase crop yields.  Research and Development activities completed will enhance the understanding of the relationship of plant water stress to microenvironmental conditions and how plant water stress and microenvironmental conditions can be accurately measured and forecast with low cost sensing capabilities.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to perform research and development to validate the concept of a low-cost synthetic sensor for plant water stress.  The objective of this project is to field test the low-cost sensor arrays, compare the output to data from high-cost scientific grade sensors, and utilize the data gathered during the field test to train ML models. These ML models will perform sensor fusion on the data from the low-cost sensor arrays and output a plant water stress measurement.  These ML models can then forecast future plant water stress, which will be compared to actual field measurements for accuracy assessment and refinement.  Once refined, the ML models will determine the minimal amount of irrigation water necessary to mitigate the predicted plant water stress.  This optimized amount of irrigation water will be allocated into a recommend irrigation schedule for farmers to review and implement.  The relevance and ease of use of the recommended irrigation schedule will then be assessed by farmers.

    This SBIR Phase I project is developing a breakthrough technology to non-invasively monitor fetal oxygen levels in utero, to enable the more accurately detection of fetuses in distress and facilitate safer births for mothers and babies. Currently, obstetricians struggle with a 50-year old monitoring technology, which reports fetal heart rate and maternal contractions, and that is associated with an 89% false positive rate for detecting babies in distress. This is a major contributor to high cesarean section rates worldwide and up to 40% in some US hospitals. Because of the costs, risks for mothers and negative implications for babies' health, C-section rates are coming under scrutiny from insurers and accreditors, however, clinicians lack the means to accurately identify oxygenation starvation and, to date, no non-invasive means of directly measuring fetal oxygenation has been developed. Raydiant's system builds off traditional pulse oximetry and will employ safe levels of light, through the mother's abdomen, to monitor fetal pulse and report oxygen saturation, the crucial, but missing diagnostic. This technology will be applicable to over 2.9 million births per year in the US as an enhancement to traditional monitoring whenever a heart rate signal of concern is observed. Both the absolute oxygenation value and its trend over time will enable more informed decision making throughout the birth process.

    This project pushes the fundamental boundaries of pulse oximetry and bio-photonics. Unlike traditional finger pulse oximetry, sensing non-invasively through the maternal abdomen presents a body in a body problem, where the fetal pulse signal is orders of magnitude weaker than and intertwined with the maternal. Photons are scattered and absorbed by multiple tissue layers and there are tradeoffs between signal strength, noise and the ratio of fetal to maternal signal. Non-homogeneities from subject to subject makes calibration difficult. Addressing these challenges will require innovation in photonics hardware and signal processing and this proposal has a three specific aims: the development of a specific sensor hardware architecture that will facilitate detection of the fetal signal; development of Raydiant's algorithm to separate fetal from maternal signal, reject noise and report saturation; and validation of the combined system in a pregnant animal model, where fetal oxygenation levels are actively controlled and compared to the device reading. This proposal encompasses developing a second generation prototype system and represents critical technology de-risking aiming towards a commercial system for integration with current monitoring technology and clinical practice.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to boost the power output of solar cells by
    5-6% and reduce manufacturing costs by ~5%. By commercializing the proposed effectively
    transparent contact (ETC) technology the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE)
    of solar energy systems could be dramatically reduced, resulting in accelerated
    adoption of solar energy to address greenhouse gas emission and to become independent
    of fossil fuels. Improving power output of solar cells is one of the most effective
    means to drive down LCOE, and the ETC technology is broadly applicable to improve
    the power output of nearly all types of solar cells. Lower-cost solar cells can
    also be expected to benefit the developing world as well as disadvantaged communities
    that lack access to the power grid. In the near term, the proposed ETC technology
    will unlock higher power output and new applications for III-V photovoltaics,
    which are used predominantly in aerospace, defense, high performance consumer
    electronics and automotive. These rapidly growing markets require higher power
    output solar cells to add functionality (RADAR, LIDAR and surveillance) by increasing
    the payload capacity that is currently limited by the available space to mount
    the solar cells. \n\nThe proposed project will demonstrate the commercial viability
    of the ETC technology by demonstrating a new world record solar cell and scalable
    fabrication on commercial III-V solar cells. Metal contacts are required for charge
    extraction from solar cells, typically covering 5-6% of the front surface and
    blocking sunlight from reaching the photovoltaic material below. These losses
    due to blocking of incoming sunlight by the metal contacts are the largest single
    contribution to the performance loss in most solar cells. The proposed ETC technology
    eliminates these losses and thereby boost the solar cell power output by 5-6%.
    The ETC technology has been demonstrated at lab scale and is world's highest performing
    front contact technology. During the research project, ETCs will be integrated
    with commercial III-V solar cells supplied by prospective initial customers and
    world-leading research partners. The technical viability of ETCs will be established
    by achieving dramatic improvements in cell efficiency for each cell type, whereas
    the commercial viability will be established by successfully integrating the ETCs
    using techniques, materials, and tools suitable for commercial scale-up. Completion
    of these objectives will accelerate the efforts to commercialize the ETC technology,
    which will broadly increase power output and reduce cost of solar energy.\n\nThis

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project involves the creation of particles that
    will allow one to see a map of temperature within a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    (MRI) measurement.  This is a significant advancement because conventional thermometry
    is usually invasive, allows only single point temperature measurements, and may
    interfere with the therapeutic and imaging instrument. The proposed technology
    is designed to be biocompatible and minimally invasive, leading to fast 3D temperature
    mapping deep in the human body. The proposed materials and techniques can be used
    with MRI-guided thermal procedures which can replace scalpel-based surgery for
    a variety of cancers, improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical time. The
    method can also be used to improve treatments for essential tremor, uterine fibrosis
    and arteriovenous malformation. In these treatments, the temperature in the entire
    affected region must be constantly monitored. Due to the limitations of the currently
    used temperature measurement methods, these minimally invasive MRI-guided procedures
    are not frequently used or take considerably longer time than desired because
    surgeons often must work around failed temperature measurements. The work in this
    proposal could transform current methods of MRI-guided thermometry, significantly
    reducing surgery time and cost as well as improving patient outcomes.  \n\nThis
    proposal develops a novel, minimally-invasive method of creating temperature maps
    superimposed on anatomical MRI images. The technology uses a new type of temperature-sensitive
    sensor, in the form of magnetic nanoparticles, and could ultimately be used within
    human or other tissues.  The key idea is that magnetic particles embedded in tissue
    will create a local dipole magnetic field that will modulate (statically or dynamically)
    the homogeneity of the main static magnetic field of the MRI scanner.  This changes
    the nuclear relaxation times of the tissue and broadens the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
    (NMR) linewidth, ultimately leading to local changes in the brightness of the
    MRI image.  The magnetization of the particles is engineered to change with temperature,
    and therefore the results are temperature dependent. Different shades of gray
    in the weighted gradient echo MR images, can then be calibrated to obtain a spatial
    map of temperature. This has immediate application in providing real-time temperature
    information to the surgeon during MRI-guided thermal interventional procedures
    to treat cancer, for example. These new contrast sensors can operate in a wide
    temperature range both below and above the human body temperature, producing spatial
    maps of temperature with an accuracy better than 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThis award

    very prevalent in the aging population, presbyopia and cataract, with a single
    intraocular lens. Presbyopia, the age dependent loss in the ability of the eye
    to adjust focus, is expected to affect 1.37 billion people worldwide by 2020.
    Cataract, the irreversible clouding of the lens that results in blurred vision,
    is expected to affect 30.1 million Americans by 2020. Despite these ever-increasing
    numbers, there currently is no single product available that restores both visual
    acuity and a complete range of spectacle-free vision following cataract refractive
    surgery. Such a solution would provide a greatly improved quality of life for
    patients and would inform future scientific developments in human accommodation
    and cataract formation. Alongside improved quality of life, vision correction
    has the added benefit of increased productivity in the workforce. The cataract
    surgical and intraocular lens exchange markets are significant, with 25.5 million
    IOL implants and $3.3 billion in sales in 2016 worldwide. With the growing and
    aging population, these numbers are expected to increase at a rapid rate. This
    device will fill a significant unmet need and has the potential of restoring a
    range of vision unlike any device currently in the market. \n\nThe proposed intraocular
    lens utilizes a highly sensitive refractive system leveraging large differences
    in refractive indices and has a mechanism of action unlike any currently in the
    market. It has the potential of levels of accommodation that are on par with accommodative
    abilities in a healthy, natural human lens. Forces in the eye are minimal, so
    this level of sensitivity is critical to any effective accommodating intraocular
    lens solution. Current devices and those in development do not exhibit the required
    level of sensitivity and subsequent accommodative amplitude to warrant significant
    adoption in the industry. Additionally, the proposed device shape mimics the natural
    lens, which allows for maximum utilization of the minute forces in the eye and
    prevents posterior capsular opacification. The first goal of this research will
    be the design and optimization of the lens utilizing a combination of mechanical
    and optical modeling. Lens prototypes will then be molded in a biocompatible,
    medical grade silicone. These prototypes will then be assessed for accommodative
    ability - first in an established opto-mechanical model eye experiment, then in
    an established human cadaver eye experiment. Finally, the prototypes will be assessed
    for injectability, to assure smooth integration with standard cataract surgical
    procedures.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    This SBIR Phase I project will further the development of an orally administered gene delivery vehicle called the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP) that is able to overcome the physical barriers of the mucus to deliver DNA-based drugs to the cells of the gastrointestinal tract. The therapeutic agent will then be expressed as a protein locally in the gastrointestinal tract or be secreted into the bloodstream to treat the full body. Development of this vehicle will lead to novel scientific insights on DNA delivery that will benefit and educate the field of fundamental science and engineering. Successful commercialization would benefit pharmaceutical companies by providing an oral drug delivery platform for approved and novel drugs, U.S. patients by reducing the need for injectable drugs and thereby increasing compliance and quality of life, and payers by reducing costs associated with injectable drugs and improving outcomes by increasing patient compliance via oral administration. The drug-agnostic feature provides broad and diverse market opportunities within the rapidly expanding market for biologics, among other therapeutic agents leading to substantial job creation. As an example, a potential addressable market in four areas (i.e., delivering TNF inhibitors, protein replacement, peptide hormones, and blood factors) exceeds $90 billion per year.

    This project is designed to prepare a stable oral formulation of the Crypt-Reaching Particle (CRP), a novel drug-agnostic drug delivery vehicle, and demonstrate that it can deliver a functional DNA cargo for expression and secretion in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. This project focuses on the technical challenges associated with preserving the functionality of a DNA cargo as an example of a challenging drug delivery scenario that is difficult to replicate. The innovation is the design of the vehicle to penetrate through the mucus and transfect underlying epithelial cells by mimicking the enteric poliovirus. This will lay the foundation for the first oral gene therapy. Briefly, the project will address three objectives. First, preparation of a formulation for the CRP for oral administration via lyophilization with analyses to assess formulation and DNA stability as a function of time, temperature, and pH. Second, testing the ability of the orally formulated CRP to deliver a functional DNA plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro by measuring both cellular and secreted expression. Finally, testing the ability of the orally formulated and administered CRP to deliver a functional Gaussia luciferase plasmid to intestinal epithelial cells in vivo in Fischer 344 rats to assess expression and secretion.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the unacceptable incidence of
    orthopedic device-related infections, as well as the dangerous rise of antibiotic
    resistant bacteria. More than 100,000 implanted orthopedic fixation devices (pins,
    plates, and screws) acquire bacterial infections each year in the US, accounting
    for approximately $1.5 trillion in associated medical and surgical treatment costs.
    Furthermore, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics to treat these infections has
    led to a dramatic rise in antibiotic resistance, which poses a severe risk to
    human health. This project aims to develop and optimize a commercially viable
    process to impart orthopedic fixation devices with a unique surface nanotexture
    designed to inhibit bacterial attachment and disrupt the biofilm cycle while simultaneously
    stimulating robust implant integration with adjacent bone. Importantly, this treatment
    acts via topography alone and does not incorporate antimicrobial agents or pharmaceuticals.
    Due to the ubiquity and gravity of the infection epidemic, this first-of-its-kind
    antibacterial surface technology is expected to rapidly infiltrate the orthopedic
    device market and drive a dramatic market shift towards the development of products
    with enhanced biological activity. Ultimately, this project has the potential
    to alleviate significant clinical and economic burdens while stimulating technological
    advances in a competitive market. \n\nThe proposed work aims to create an antibacterial
    surface nanotexture by utilizing a proprietary modified atomic deposition technique.
    The fabrication parameters used during this deposition process are closely linked
    to the resulting surface characteristics (and thus its antimicrobial efficacy).
    However, the link between fabrication parameters and antimicrobial efficacy is
    inadequately understood currently. Therefore, the proposed work employs a systematic
    strategy to elucidate the relationships involved and establish control over the
    fabrication process and resulting surface properties. The project is separated
    into four stages, each designed to explore the effect of a specific fabrication
    parameter on performance outcomes, including bacterial colonization, bone cell
    functions, and trends in certain surface properties that often correlate with
    cell-substrate interactions (e.g. surface energy, roughness, skewness, etc.).
    The relationships revealed through testing will be used to build a set of equations
    that describe how the properties of the nanotextured surface vary as a function
    of the fabrication parameters. This set of equations will then be used to optimize
    the system, enabling consistent and controllable operation of the deposition process
    as manufacturing specifications evolve. In addition to advancing the development
    of a market-changing product, the proposed research will contribute to the growing
    understanding of cell and bacteria responses on nanostructured surfaces in an
    ongoing effort to mitigate infection associated with orthopedic implants.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide high-performance light filtering at a level that potentially affects all people in the world. Inexpensive high-performance light filters allow for early detection of cancer and infection by bringing the highest-precision technologies such as fluorescence microscopy and sensing to portable, consumer diagnostic devices. They also make sensors in self-driving cars and other intelligent devices of the future to detect objects in the surroundings more accurately by eliminating the undesired light noise from the ambient and focusing on the target frequencies of light only. Batteries of future mobile devices may also last up to 20% longer due to more efficient light energy management in display units that become possible with low-cost, large-scale optical filters.?Finally,?the anticipated lower manufacturing cost at high volume will allow for more high-tech manufacturing jobs to remain in the US.

    The proposed project will establish the technical feasibility of using a novel multi-material, micro- and nano-layered film production process in order to produce visible and near-infrared thin-film optical filters. The time and cost requirements of conventional, deposition-based production techniques of such filters are a significant barrier to market growth and commercial acceptance of their broad range of uses. In order to address this market gap, this project will investigate the elements necessary for consistent production of filters made of hybrid organic/inorganic materials using the novel process of thermal drawing. This investigation will cover methods of integration and handling of hybrid organic-inorganic materials in the thermal drawing process as well as understanding and controlling fluidic instabilities at interfaces to obtain filter uniformity and integrity. The results of the proposed research will determine whether the novel thermal drawing process, in conjunction with developed materials and handling techniques, can reliably generate high-performance visible and near infrared filters at scale.

    Research (SBIR) project is the potential to deploy a powerful tool for carbon
    capture.  CO2-capture is the foundation of greenhouse gas mitigation.  The high
    cost of current processes for CO2-capture have prevented their widespread deployment.
    \ High-pressure, Density-driven Separator (HDS) technology efficiently and continuously
    captures CO2 from gas streams, including both flue gas and fuel gas.  An HDS module
    produces nearly Pure High-pressure CO2 (PH-CO2).  HDS technology has transformational
    operating expense enabled by innovative strategies for compression, expansion,
    energy recovery, and subsequent use of the dense and light fractions.  An HDS
    module has no moving parts, membranes, pressure swings or temperature swings.
    \ Therefore, HDS technology has the potential for very low capital expense.  These
    low costs allow access to financial markets.  Other revenue sources are also facilitated
    by low capture cost.  For instance, PH-CO2 is food grade, valued in excess of
    $100/ton.  PH-CO2 is suitable for enhanced oil recovery.  HDS technology separates
    CO2 from fuel gas, producing a valuable high-pressure vapor, in addition to PH-CO2.
    \ HDS technology dramatically reduces the CO2-capture cost and provides a purity
    that enables a profitable B2B model. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to
    develop HDS technology.  Quantitative metrics will be refined and employed to
    develop detailed capital expense and operating cost models.  Two technical hurdles
    must be overcome to reduce these costs.  These hurdles are also opportunities
    for innovation.  The first opportunity is to achieve sufficient volumetric efficiency
    in the pressure vessel for commercial deployment.  The equilibrium state inside
    the HDS module is perfect separation.  Increasing the rate of approach to that
    equilibrium state reduces the size and cost of the HDS module. This will be accomplished
    by exploiting the synergy between fluid state, surface state, fluid motion, and
    gravity.  This synergy coalesces CO2, allowing its rapid separation from the remaining
    components of flue gas and fuel gas.  The second opportunity is to achieve sufficient
    overall process efficiency for commercial deployment.  The power required for
    compression determines operating expense.  Our strategy involves operating the
    near-isothermal cold compression train and near-isothermal hot expansion train
    as a heat engine (an approximation of the Ericsson cycle).  In this manner, innovative
    gerotor compressors and expanders work together with heat exchangers using waste
    heat to reduce or eliminate operating costs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of an advanced manufacturing technology that will enable the production of high-quality optical glass lenses that are customizable and affordable, without the use of laborious machining or expensive tooling common in traditional lens manufacturing. The technology aims to reduce lens production costs by at least 5x while increasing throughput by ~6-8x. In addition, the project will address a key industry need to improve integration of optical components with electro-mechanical systems such as those found in compact camera modules. The methods and tools developed here will enable systems integration at a wafer level, thereby simplifying assembly, reducing cost/weight/size and improving the overall performance of many next-generation devices. This outcome will have a significant impact on imaging technology used in smartphones, wearable electronics, miniature aerial vehicles, medical endoscopes, and advanced automotive driver assistance systems. Hence, the project has the potential to benefit a diverse number of industries and strengthen U.S. economic competitiveness within the optics sector. In a broader sense, the technology developed in this project will also help revitalize American manufacturing.

    The proposed project will demonstrate a new method of lens manufacturing by leveraging semiconductor processing techniques and developing an innovative lens fabrication tool. The new tool will measure key optical metrics in real-time during lens creation for on-the-fly process adjustments. Closed-loop feedback during fabrication will improve tolerances and yields and produce higher quality lenses compared to traditional methods. This approach represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing as all commercial lenses today are created through iterations of lens forming and ensuing optical metrology. Furthermore, the tool will enable rapid production of customizable lens shapes, including a novel planar lens. The flat lens will be compatible with surface modification technologies such as those used to create electronics and micro mechanical structures, thus enabling, for example, thin film transistors or sensors to be fabricated with the optics at a wafer level. Specific research activities will include (1) designing and constructing manufacturing tools and fixtures, (2) experimentally correlating tool configurations with lens shapes, (3) constructing and characterizing concave, convex and planar lenses and (4) developing a software model of the lenses based on realistic manufacturing constraints.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to bring to the market a faster and cheaper means of gathering highly accurate local air quality.  This will be done through the use of miniaturization of chemical sensors that are carried by UAVs.  Not only will there be technical hurdles that will be overcome through the implementation of this means of gathering data, the use of UAVs in this manner pushes the boundaries of their use in urban areas in a way that has not been done before.  The societal and commercial impact will be to reduce cost and time in obtaining air quality at a point in time and space, thereby making air quality measurements less of a financial and technical burden to governments, organizations and corporations.  This progress will help ensure that communities can address air quality concerns through the data gathered.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to implement a novel means to couple a low-cost technology to detect when chemical components reach a given threshold in the air with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a means of delivering the sensors to a specified location.  The sensor technology utilizes colorimetric detection of chemicals.  Off-the-shelf colorimetric sensors, combined with a unique algorithm, produce color difference maps for toxic industrial chemicals at their permissible exposure level (PEL) concentrations.  The objective of the research is to determine if the proposed approach will allow for accurate chemical sensing for a precise location.  It is anticipated that the technology to be utilized will allow for an accurate capture of a broad range of pollutants and chemical compounds along with concentration levels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project arises from bringing new materials to market for making improved rechargeable lithium ion batteries needed by the high-tech economy, medicine, and the military (batteries are the second largest military consumable). In today's world, everything, including medical devices (e.g., wireless implants and sensors), has an app; using apps requires batteries. This project will produce "Safer Energy for the Wireless World"; the resulting improved batteries will incorporate novel, lighter, and safer (no overheating) anode materials that will charge faster and store more energy than current versions. The new anode materials are estimated upon success to yield sales of $1B during the first 10 years from selling the materials to battery manufacturers to incorporate, initially, as composites in lithium ion battery anodes, and, later, as the entire active anode. Broader societal impacts include greater safety because the batteries do not overheat; lighter, more portable devices with longer battery life and faster recharging time; reduced need for backup batteries; and diverse STEM workforce development though applied research and entrepreneurship training.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop safer, more powerful ways to charge electronic devices by translating fundamental research from university to industry. The opportunity arises from an NSF-supported discovery of the first solid form of carbon monoxide known, a two-dimensional crystal structure: graphene monoxide (GmO). GmO and its first proposed application for anodes in lithium ion batteries are patented. Knowledge gaps to be addressed include identifying tailored materials for optimizing batteries for electronics, using theoretical and experimental approaches to identify the maximum energy storage capacity for lithium batteries, and determining the energy and power densities and safety properties under normal and extreme operating conditions. The technology must be demonstrated in 200-mAh pouch batteries, the first milestone needed for battery manufacturers to consider adopting the innovation through licensing or sales. The second milestone is to scale up materials to produce large quantities. The overall goal is to commercialize the GmO material into an active anode or additive material for extreme batteries. In sum, the project will yield prototype batteries made from the new materials, optimize properties for specific partner applications, simulate interactions between GmO and Li, and identify pathways for scaleup of materials production.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development and widespread adaptation of next generation

    is that graphite's internal structure limits lithium diffusion within interlayer

    a newly-discovered high-quality graphene network, consisting of incommensurately-stacked
    multilayer graphene (IMLG) assembled in three-dimensional (3D) form. It exhibits
    unique structural and electrical properties that enable the reversible intercalation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Project (SBIR) project is the development of a platform for pathogen identification and other genomic applications that achieves rapid, sensitive, multiplexed single-molecule detection.  The genomic diagnostics market is poised to grow to $40 billion by 2021.  The goal of this platform will be to offer multiplexed detection of more than 1,000 pathogens, allowing accurate point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases.  Other genomic applications that also are possible include assessment of the microbiome or monitoring opportunistic infections in pulmonary diseases.  In addition, the platform has the potential for use in genomic sequencing, a market that is expected to reach $9 billion by 2020.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a highly multiplexed, bioelectronic, label-free assay platform capable of real-time, label-free detection of thousands of nucleic acid targets without amplification. This will be accomplished  through the use of nanoscale single-molecule field-effect transistors (smFETs) on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit platform, which fully leverages the economies of scale of modern semiconductor manufacturing. The initial target application for this technology is multiplexed pathogen identification at the point-of-need. This project will bring the technology to wafer-scale manufacturing, which will both improve device quality and lower the per device cost of manufacture, and demonstrate proof-of-concept for genomic detection (without amplification) on clinical samples.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is as diverse as the laser technology itself.  Lasers have become the true facilitator of the data-based society.  It is tool of choice for future smart factories and on-demand manufacturing.  It serves as the fundamental building block of optical sensing systems used to collect large volumes of critical data to be used for decision making in every facet of society.  The myriad of new applications for laser systems echoes the same demand ? higher power.  The bottleneck in the power generation is often the capability of optical components of the laser to withstand the power without degradation.  So the greater potential of lasers can be unleashed if there would be a way to break through the power handling capability of laser components starting with the nonlinear optical crystals indispensable in creating these powerful energy sources.  This research project is precisely designed to address this need and the successful completion of this project would enable the next generation of miniaturized electronic devices, expand our horizon of biological imagery and precision surgery, and explore our universe with instruments that are currently confined to our laboratories.

    The proposed project targets the most common material used to generate high power visible and UV light ? Lithium Triborate (LBO) crystal.  Able to handle power density up to 45GW/cm2, LBO is currently the material of choice for high energy industrial lasers.  However, optical surfaces where the light enter and exit LBO often get damaged well before the actual bulk material.  Traditional dielectric anti-reflective (AR)  coatings on these surfaces are typically made using a limited selection of materials of lower damage threshold in a process highly susceptible to contamination, resulting in significantly lower damage threshold than the bulk LBO crystal.  In this proposal, state-of-the-art surface-texturing processes on LBO will be developed to eliminate the use of these dielectric films while still providing the necessary AR functionality.  A variety of processes and materials on LBO surfaces will be attempted and studied with resulting surfaces tested for absorption and damage threshold.

    to growing global demand for both the electric vehicle (EV) and stationary storage
    industries. The search is on for new ways to improve energy and power density,
    reduce charging time, and extend battery life. The project will create a diagnostic

    to accelerate scientific understanding of how batteries age. A more accurate assessment
    of battery degradation in real time can inform on-board algorithms, can improve
    overall battery pack efficiency, and has major cost saving impacts for automakers
    and stationary storage users. This predictability enables more cost-effective
    warranty management, improved charging and safety algorithms, and ever more efficient
    battery pack designs.  Having a sense of remaining useful life also enables the
    battery to be re-used in a secondary application - creating new business opportunities

    reduces costs for both consumers and manufacturers, and contributes to greener
    use of resources for society. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
    Phase I project unlocks key insights for large-format lithium batteries. Today?s
    battery management systems (BMS) do not track a battery?s actual degradation metrics
    so it cannot forecast remaining useful life. This makes it hard to predict the
    ?cliff?, a sudden and steep drop in capacity near a battery?s end of life.  This
    forces battery makers to overdesign battery systems to reduce chances of premature
    failure before the warranty expiration. The proposed research employs electrochemical
    impedance spectroscopy (EIS) onboard a BMS.  EIS is a diagnostic tool that measures
    battery impedance - something only possible in a lab setting today. Tracking impedance
    unlocks a lifetime of degradation data and helps battery engineers better understand
    the long-term degradation behavior of high voltage battery packs. The project
    will focus on 1) minimizing the required hardware to measure impedance of each
    cell in a series-connected battery pack, and 2) reducing the down-time associated
    with the impedance measurement. The proposed innovation blends a unique hardware
    architecture with wide-bandgap semiconductors and adaptive charge-control algorithms
    to minimize hardware size. These help to reduce overall system cost and unlocks
    orders of magnitude improvement in hardware scalability over existing EIS methods.\n\nThis

    vibration signature during normal operating cycles. Change in equipment vibration

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to commercially develop an in vitro (cell culture) platform to enhance the efficiency of drug discovery. Every drug delivered to a human engages the network of blood vessels for delivery to the target tissue or as part of the removal. An essential feature of the blood vessel network is an extensive network of small vessels surrounded by smooth muscle which can contract and dilate to control blood flow, and thus drug delivery. There are no in vitro human platforms that can mimic this biological function, despite the fact that cardiovascular toxicity is the leading cause of failure in clinical trials. As such, a pre-clinical tool to assess vascular toxicity would significantly impact the drug development process. Developing a successful drug averages 10-12 years and nearly $2.6 billion. Despite the fact that ~60% of the total development costs are spent on human clinical trials, fewer than 1 in 10 entering clinical trials will succeed. There is a significant opportunity to improve the accuracy of preclinical drug screening which, in turn, will generate dramatic cost savings and shorten time-to-market. The company's proposed vasoactive human vascular network represents a leap forward in technology to simulate the human response to new and existing drugs. Furthermore, the platform technology has broad future applications including the incorporation of tissue specific function (e.g, human tumor cells) and patient specificity which will further advance drug development and precision medicine.

    There are currently no in vitro platforms that can mimic vasoconstriction or vasorelaxation, processes which require vasoresponsive smooth muscle cells. Competing technologies line prefabricated tubes or membranes with endothelial cells to mimic the vasculature which will never be able to simulate vasoactivity. Since the company's platform is comprised of living dynamic microvessels, the company is uniquely positioned to create a platform with this functionality. The primary objective is to develop a 3D perfused human vascular network with smooth muscle providing the capacity to characterize vasoactive substances. The company will achieve the primary objective by completing two specific aims: 1) Incorporate human smooth muscle cells into a 3D in vitro vascular network; and 2) Quantify the dose-response of the 3D perfused vessel network to a panel of vasoactive drugs. Achieving vasoactive functionality in an in vitro vascular network will be the first demonstration of this critical biological phenomenon, and will meet an important commercial need in the pharmaceutical industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of drone-based technology to manage fires more safely, efficiently, and effectively.  Wildfires cause hundreds of billions of dollars in annual damages in the United States. As the size and number of wildfires increases, prescribed fires have emerged as one of the most cost-effective tools to reduce catastrophic damage by removing excess fuel for wildfires and controlling their evolution. Yet, to be most effective, prescribed fires require putting people in the proximity of fire and are often limited by the unavailability (due to cost or demand) of fast delivery mechanisms such as those provided by helicopters. This effort will result in technology that directly addresses both pain points by improving the intelligence of drone-based fire monitoring and ignition systems. This project has the potential to shape how fire management is conducted in the future, making it safer for fire personnel and enabling cost-effective prescribed fire practices that can help society to control catastrophic wildfires and better manage landscapes.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of drone-based technology that will transform fire management. Current drone-based ignition and monitoring systems have the potential to change the field but are hampered by their extensive reliance on human controllers. This lack of automation limits these systems? potential applicability, scale, effectiveness, and unnecessarily increases their risk. The proposed work aims to make monitoring and ignition more intelligent and scalable through: 1) specialized machine learning pipelines to characterize fire fronts and identify ground assets; 2) light-weight fire simulation engine that can provide short-horizon prediction of the fire front evolution while executing on limited computer power; and 3) distributed planning algorithms that adjust the drone's trajectory and sphere drop strategy to manipulate fire intensity while keeping ground assets, vehicles, and personnel safe. These challenges are especially difficult to address given the harsh fire environment, the weight and power constraints of commercial drones preferred for these activities, and the integration of two distinct domains, drone navigation and fire management.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project seeks to commercialize new sensor technologies
    that enable the rapid measurement of the handedness of molecular mixtures.   Like
    screws and keys, many molecules possess a certain handedness that can be important
    when interacting with living systems.  This issue is vital to pharmaceutical research,
    where one handed form of a drug may result in benefits while the opposite form
    may cause harmful side effects.  Consequently, measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures is of paramount importance in modern pharmaceutical research.  However,
    conventional approaches to making these measurements are often too slow for modern
    pharmaceutical discovery and development research where high-throughput experiments
    on hundreds or even thousands of samples per day are performed.  This project
    aims to remove this bottleneck by leveraging a recently introduced new instrument
    and commercializing reagent kits that have been shown in academic laboratories
    to achieve a much faster and simpler method for measuring the handedness of molecular
    mixtures.  Making this improved technology widely available to the greater research
    and development community has the potential to streamline drug development efforts
    at reduced cost and minimized waste production, which is expected to increase
    profit margins and create new jobs in research, development and manufacturing,
    resulting in substantial benefit to the health and economy of the United States.
    \ \n\nThe innovation of this project comprises a series of optical sensors, developed
    during a decade of fundamental research in the participating laboratories, which
    will allow rapid eescreening of a variety of asymmetric reactions. The focus of
    this unprecedented enterprise is to validate selected sensors against pharmaceutically
    relevant compounds, determine the error of the optical assays by comparison with
    traditional techniques such as chiral HPLC, to evaluate the robustness in the
    presence of potential interferants, and to apply a sensor in the analysis of an
    asymmetric reaction using multi-well plate technology. The development of a user-friendly
    kit will include the testing of different methods for the creation of pre-dispensed
    dried sensors that can be reconstituted without leaving behind residues that might
    increase the error margin beyond a few percent which is generally acceptable for
    high-throughput screening applications. The final outcome will be a convenient
    mix-and-measure protocol that enables rapid analysis of hundreds of small-scale
    asymmetric reaction mixtures.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable a new generation of collaborative robots that are capable and safe. Collaborative robotics is poised to revolutionize manufacturing where they will enable better utilization of factory space and machines, reduce energy cost, and mitigate labor shortages. Safe operation is a critical factor for successful operation of collaborative robotics, especially if they are mobile. The proposed project will demonstrate that tactile sensing skins can make robots safer, more collaborative, and manufactured at reasonable cost. The proposed task will also contribute to workforce development and enhance scientific understanding in the critical fields of robotics, soft robotics, and artificial intelligence, as well as providing opportunities for local students.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate a novel type of tactile sensing skin to improve robot safety and its ability to interact with human users. Unlike previous work, the proposed skin can detect obstacles from a distance of up to 20cm, as well as measuring contact and force. Also, the ability to detect user gestures such as tapping, rubbing or poking, opens new avenues for human-robot interaction and will enable the study of truly collaborative robots. The proposed research and development project will overcome the following key challenges that stand in the way of commercializing the technology: scaling from single patches to full-body sensing skins, fusing proximity data collected from the skin with those provided by conventional 3D sensors, and demonstrating its benefits in a series of real-world use cases.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the challenge of developing students? empathy and emotional self-awareness with a mobile-based platform. Aligning with the NSF's mission to develop innovative education programs to enhance aspects of emotional intelligence, this project will address three major pain points for young learners with far-reaching implications. First, the need to develop emotional intelligence; which has been identified as a 21st-century literacy that is crucial for younger learners to thrive. Current school climate issues with bullying and violence consistently reinforce the need to address social and emotional learning. Next, the need to integrate social and emotional learning into regular classroom activities. With the demands placed on schools for testing, having a program that integrates with what schools are already responsible should support more widespread adoption. Finally, the program addresses a widespread need to combat the deleterious effects of the current uses of social media by young students. This project will bring a positive spin to social networking that can improve the emotional intelligence skills of students


    The proposed innovation is an augmented reality-based experience that immerses fourth and fifth-grade students in activities designed to build their skills of emotional intelligence; namely, emotional self-awareness and empathy, as they interact with a network of peers. The key technical challenges the project must solve include: refining core methods for developing emotional self-awareness and empathy, defining and refining a user experience that teachers/parents will find educationally compelling and with which learners will love to engage, designing a curating process for learner-generated content that will ensure the safety and security of all users and developing virtual interactions that engage students in emotional skill development, and connecting activities with the materials for which students are already responsible.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to, firstly, shed light on the benefits and limitations of mm-wave backscatter technologies in challenging industrial environments. More importantly, the lessons learned during this project could, if successful, bring about the emergence of breakthrough energy-autonomous real-time tracking technologies that would significantly increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of worldwide container shipping as well as provide a direct value that could bring about the adoption of the smart container. The container shipping industry stands as one of the unsung heroes of the modern world which, from its birth in the 1960s, cut the cost of shipping goods across the globe by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling global trade on a massive scale and catalyzing the world?s economic development. Nevertheless, this industry has remained largely unmoved by the advent of big data and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This innovation could empower the general introduction and leveraging of such tools, further lower the costs and increase the accessibility of worldwide shipping, and significantly benefit the world and the United States? economies.

    The proposed project will require, on the road towards commercialization, the exploration of the properties of backscatter mm-wave localization approaches and channels in complex highly cluttered environments such as that of metallic-parts-crowded repair facilities and terminals covered with container stacks. While significant research efforts are currently invested in the characterization and mapping of mm-wave transmission channels necessary to the planning and rolling out of upcoming cellular 5G networks, no such work has yet been reported for their backscatter counterparts, nor for localization purposes. In addition, although the influence of channels for standard Radio Frequency IDentification-based localization systems has benefited from decades of investigation, that of its higher-frequency correspondent is virtually unexplored and should display different properties and present novel challenges and opportunities, due to major differences in clutter diffraction and absorption. The work will start with the finalization of tag and reader hardware in view of the gathering of detection data in the aforementioned environments, followed by the formulation of the high-performance signal processing schemes used to retrieve tag positions and identities, developed hand in hand with optimized communications modulation schemes for the tags. Finally, a tuning of the devised numerical processing schemes for high-speed embedded processing will take place.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to provide software service to correct Earth observation
    satellite (EOS) data to at-ground reflectance. EOS must look through the Earth?s
    atmosphere that induces systematic error in measuring the actual reflectance of
    ground targets through scatter and attenuation of light. Atmospherically-induced
    error affects data utility because the atmospheric aerosol content, i.e., humidity,
    dust, pollen, smoke particles, etc., fluctuates greatly, impacting applications
    for global monitoring, defense and agriculture. The value of data could make this
    a significant and growing market opportunity if the specifications are met successfully.
    \       \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to correct aerosol-induced error
    in EOS data by reversing the effect, found empirically to be structured, independent
    of aerosol type and potentially predictable through measurement of dark target-reflectance
    ? water bodies clear of aquatic vegetation, entrained sediment and specular reflectance
    from windblown waves. The method of study is extraction and statistical analysis
    of Landsat 8 data, the standard reference for calibration and validation of data
    from all other EOS platforms. This problem is approached through a series of heuristic
    investigations to (1) reconstruct relationships of blue, green and red bands to
    near infrared (NIR) originally fitted using Landsat 5 and 7 data (longer wavelengths
    may not be addressed because they are resistant to atmospheric affects), (2) use
    these relationships to reverse the error, (3) develop methods to select, proof
    and apply dark targets that calibrate the correction, and (4) measure residual
    error by comparing post-algorithm reflectance to at-ground reflectance measured
    by portable spectrometry. The residual error is likely due to uncertainty associated
    with dark targets. Once developed and proofed, the algorithm will be brought to
    the Landsat 8 Cal/Val team for validation.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is empowering the 68 million U.S. natural gas consumers to know their transaction status in real time, have more and continual control of their transactions, settle transactions in increments less than the industry?s current monthly accounting cycle and enjoy an extremely high level of security. Their transaction cost will be reduced and speed increased, freeing industry capacity and resources to be employed elsewhere at greater value. This innovation will allow others in the natural gas industry to better consider transaction processes and themselves innovate - employing many minds on industry efficiency. This innovation will also have application to other industries characterized by multiple complex, multi-party transactions; particularly the electric utility industry and possibly providing the catalyst for more extensive deregulation and consumer control.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover how to transform complex natural gas utility transaction management processes using Blockchain innovations and related technologies across production, transmission, distribution and consumption functions. The United States utility industry has operated in its present physical form for more than a century. Over the past four decades the industry has evolved through various policy and regulatory actions to open transaction participation to thousands of parties. During the past two decades, digital technologies enabled transaction functions to talk to each other and perform some functions automatically. Despite this progress, utility transaction management processes are essentially those created decades ago. They still require significant human intervention, remain highly segmented and employ little digital intelligence and security technology available today. The various technologies now supporting the industry?s seven step transaction processes will be mapped, assessed for Blockchain technology application and then consolidated into a single platform. The key challenge is to create transformative technology integrating the numerous other existing technology applications and data exchange formats and protocols without succumbing to customization which then mutes the transformative nature of the innovation and renders it ineffective as a platform to subsequent industry innovation by multiple parties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project enables connectivity in otherwise difficult areas. Broadband access in rural America, for example, has been a lasting problem that inhibits business and education alike. The primary barrier to installation is the cost of trenching cable, which can be $7,000-$30,000 per service location. Similar challenges exist in emerging markets and remote industrial Internet of Things. Networks cannot easily be replaced with today?s wireless technologies due to the losses that occur when forwarding information wirelessly, which can eliminate up to half of the throughput capability at each forwarding location. Low-loss mesh networking, such as that proposed, would enable fully-wireless solutions to last-mile connectivity problems globally by eliminating reliance on cable. The impact of distributed and scalable algorithms extends beyond mesh networking into the decentralization of other technologies to be more secure and robust, but cannot due to performance issues.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on low-loss mesh networking that could feasibly cover hundreds or thousands of acres with broadband internet access without laying cable. The primary intellectual merits include scalable aggregation of data, reducing communication interference with a predetermined network structure, and other challenges that arise in very large wireless networks. The objective of this research is a wireless mesh network topology and hardware that can maintain less than 17% throughput loss-per-hop in a network larger than 100 nodes. This will be accomplished through real-world trials, simulations, and iterated testing of different geometries and time-domain multiplexing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a safe, natural, long-lasting and effective mosquito repellent product by exploiting the natural repellent compounds present in the skin microbiome.  Mosquito-borne illnesses affect 700M people worldwide and cause several million deaths each year.  Chikungunya, West Nile, Malaria, Zika, Dengue, are just some of the debilitating vectors spread by mosquitoes. Mosquito-derived diseases cost >$6.8B/year and the market for mosquito repellents is >$3.2B and growing. Many solutions are aimed at killing and disabling mosquitoes, but mosquitoes are a crucial part of the ecological food chain. Further, many repellents are extremely toxic, and mosquitoes are developing resistance. The proposed technology will be used to identify compounds that will drive the endogenous skin microbiome to a more mosquito repellent phenotype. Using these methods, it is possible to harness the biochemistry contained in the native skin microbiome to create an endogenous repellency that is a safe, natural, environmentally friendly, and effective barrier to mosquitoes. It is expected that this repellency approach may be used safely even with children and pregnant women. In addition, it may be possible to use this approach to develop repellents for multiple insects, repellent products for companion animals, and additional over-the-counter skin products.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a new class of topical insect repellents by influencing repellency in the skin microbiome.  This will be accomplished by developing and validating a platform technology to identify compounds produced by the microbiome that are associated with biochemical pathways of interest, and use the identified compounds to target those pathways whose end-products comprise natural mosquito-repellent compounds. The goal is to create a topical mosquito repellent product. For this project, the plan is to complete metagenome sequencing on skin samples collected from individuals that are either naturally repellent or attractive to Anopheles mosquitoes (the mosquito that carries Malaria). The next step is to predict metabolite compound turnover and use metabolomics to validate the results. In vitro assays and in silico models will be used to provide proof-of-concept for the use of those predicted compounds to induce the microbiota to produce mosquito repellent metabolites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development of a robust capillary electrophoresis instrument with mass spectrometry detection for biomedical research, biopharmaceutical development, clinical diagnostics, and system biology.  Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful liquid separation technology with remarkable potentials for bioanalysis. It was the workhorse tool for the completion of human genome project that, in part, led to the DNA sequencing market.  A CE system with both optical and mass spectrometry detection will enable a deeper understanding of molecular dynamics governing biochemical processes, such as protein expression, deregulation, and interaction with other biochemical species, which could lead to breakthroughs in drug development, early diagnosis, and treatments for deadly human diseases such as cancer, diabetics, and neurodegenerative disorders. The proposed technology will offer benefits to biopharmaceutical drug development companies by increasing the efficiency of product characterization for quality improvement. It also will allow efficient routine proteomics analysis and other bioanalytical applications.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a next-generation capillary electrophoresis with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) for protein characterization. CE-ESI-MS allows high efficiency separation and characterization of several biochemical species including proteins. However, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of CE-ESI-MS has been difficult due to lack of robust, easy-to-use instrumentation, which has made adoption for routine applications uncommon. This research will develop and evaluate a novel CE-ESI-MS instrument for protein characterization. The proposed instrument will employ original innovations to overcome the limitations of the incumbent technologies and exceed their capabilities. A novel fluidic nanoport for sample and buffer manipulation will be developed to allow analysis from 1 microL or less sample volume. The nanoport will employ a fully automated design with less operator intervention. This will be useful for sample-limited applications such as in clinical analysis. In addition, the instrument will utilize a hybrid electrospray ionization interface for simultaneous optical and MS detection, which no existing technology offers. Combining CE's ultrahigh efficiency with robust quantitative characteristics of optical detection and the molecular identification of mass spectrometry will be a powerful tool for bioanalysis. This combination will represent a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art and enhance the means of interrogating proteins and their biochemical functions in biological samples. The proposed innovations will significantly enhance the robustness and capabilities of CE-ESI-MS for fast, efficient, and deep bioanalysis.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project focuses on
    the growing multipoint touch sensors estimated at US $94B in 2024. Touch screens
    literally allowed access to the virtual world and its capabilities at our fingertips
    and enabled those who were keyboard illiterates to access the vast world wide
    web capabilities through this natural interface. A ubiquitous cost effective multipoint
    touch sensing technology would make a broader impact beyond consumer electronics
    by improving motor skills and potentially eliminating phantom pain for amputees
    fitted with neuro prosthetics limbs. As the digital world becomes more connected
    and continues to permeate our physical world in the form of the mobile Internet
    of Things, autonomous cars, and other wireless connected smart technologies, it
    is important to reduce the cost barrier for adoption and ease of interaction between
    the device and the human. A society that can enable all its members, youngsters
    to aging elders, to easily interface with connected assistive devices would have
    increased access to information, education, ecommerce and consequently will see
    faster economic growth. \n \nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
    I project aims at demonstrating a ubiquitous multipoint touch and force sensing
    on planar or curved surfaces that are either conducting (metals) or insulators
    (glass/plastic). Current multipoint touch sensing technologies are limited to
    transparent, insulating and planar surfaces. These technologies involve patterning
    multiple layers of semitransparent films on a glass or polyamide substrate then
    integrated with the display in a complex manufacturing process. The films? semitransparent
    nature reduces the quality of the display image and requires increasing the display
    brightness which affects the battery life in mobile devices. The high manufacturing
    cost reduces deployment and hence limits access to the wider consumer society.
    This project targets developing a low-cost technology that detects force and location
    of multi touch points on any surface without film patterning. Successful execution

- abstractText: |-
    This STTR Phase I project aims to bring together computational thinking, mechanism design, and design process to create a new framework for design-driven robotics education for K-12 schools and camps. This work would result in a platform for 1) teaching students Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) topics and 2) providing them critical hands-on experience designing, prototyping, and programming machines. By enabling students to exercise their creativity via an intuitive design interface and a minimalist novel robot kit, this project advances the students' ability to innovate and invent machines and robots. Driven by a need to keep pace with the evolving techno- and socio-economic requirements and remain competitive, schools and camps are increasingly adopting STEM and Robotics programs and products. This framework would fill that void that currently exists in the educational market. This project is closely aligned with the NSF's mandate to support development of a strong STEM workforce. The proposed design-driven educational robotics framework has the potential to fulfill these needs, improve public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology, and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    The proposed research seeks to develop a novel design-driven educational robotics framework encompassing 1) a modular, customizable, and compatible with off-the shelf electronics hardware kit consisting of rigid and compliant parts for rapid prototyping of robot structures and mechanisms, 2) a multi-modal mobile app for synthesis and simulation of robot motions, 3) a web-based CAD interface for designing users' custom robot parts that interface seamlessly with the kit, and 4) instructional material and curriculum for middle and high-schools. The hardware would provide a suite of planar parts with unique design capabilities to support creation of 3D geometry of robots and structures. The novel structural elements would give rise to a new method of enforcing geometric and kinematic constraints and provide flexibility in choice of material and manufacturing process. While the new connection methods are much more intuitive and simpler, they also closely mirror the way engineered structures are created in practice. The mobile app based on the latest mechanism synthesis research imbued with a multi-modal graphical user interface will allow creation of robot assemblies and their motions before constructing their corresponding physical models and provide necessary skills and experience in the design process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the demonstration of the technical and economic feasibility of a photonic crystal enabled thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system at scales over 10 watts, which would have transformative effects in power generation for portable and remote applications. A small, high energy density TPV power source has the potential to transform multiple markets that currently rely on battery power by reducing the battery weight by 75%. For example, remote scientific instrumentation stations in polar regions rely on 1000-2000 pounds of batteries to operate through the six-month polar night, resulting in high installation costs. Dismounted warfighters carry 10-20 pounds of batteries and would have greater capability if they could carry ammunition and water instead. Small unmanned aerial vehicles would be more effective if they could fly themselves to remote and inaccessible locations, perform their mission for longer, and then return.

    The proposed project will develop a new approach to photonic crystal fabrication to greatly improve the efficiency of TPV energy generation - the conversion of fuel into electricity with heat and light as intermediaries. A TPV generator works by burning fuel to heat a selective emitter to incandescence, leading to infrared radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. A photonic crystal selective emitter greatly improves the efficiency of the generator by almost perfectly matching its emission spectrum to the photovoltaic cell. Our photonic crystal is a square array of cylindrical micro-cavities etched into a refractory metal substrate. The research objectives of this project address the technical hurdles that limit the use of photonic crystals in TPV: scalable substrate preparation from commercial foils using a novel high-throughput process; nanofabrication over large flexible substrates using traditional semiconductor manufacturing tools; and integration with the generator by brazing. The anticipated technical results of this project are to develop a process capable of a breakthrough fifty-fold increase in photonic crystal emitter area, to enable photonic crystal fabrication on flexible substrates, and to reduce photonic crystal cost - all leading to a practical TPV generator that meets market demands.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop new methods for training and assessing the skill of providing and receiving constructive feedback in collaborative environments. The United States higher education system is failing to train collaboration skills, despite companies listing it as one of the most important skills for new hires to have. Past research has identified specific types of feedback that most effectively encourage peers to improve, but today's higher education instructors have no ready means to effectively assess students' abilities to use these peer feedback strategies. This project will develop simple-to-use software tools to help instructors train peer feedback skills and new methods for automatically assessing student ability to provide and receive constructive feedback. By democratizing the training of the collaborative skills most sought after by today's employers, this project aims to reduce underemployment of college graduates and increase the economic output and tax revenues of the United States by building a better trained and more productive workforce.

    This project will develop an innovative peer-assessment tool coupled with novel natural language processing methods producing accurate measurements of student ability to give and receive constructive feedback based on written feedback. The natural language processing methods will combine word vectors for efficient language processing, a generalizable neural net structure for sentence categorization outlined in existing research literature, and manually defined features based on existing peer feedback research. Research efforts will focus on gathering a large training dataset from partnering higher education classrooms, and iteratively refining a deep-learning natural language processing algorithm to achieve a target 90% accuracy. Automating this assessment process will allow broad and continuous assessment of student collaborative ability without requiring expensive and time-consuming retraining of the United States instructor workforce.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will advance the development of a novel
    arteriovenous graft that will minimize injury and decrease the probability of
    serious complications for chronic hemodialysis patients. Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining
    therapy for patients suffering from kidney failure; it requires that blood be
    withdrawn and cycled through a dialysis machine that performs the function of
    the failed kidneys. This process must be performed at regular intervals and requires
    access to the blood with large bore needles. Graft failure complications, many
    directly attributable to  needle injury, cost the healthcare system billions of
    dollars per year and lead to significant morbidity and even mortality for patients.
    There are nearly 2.5 million patients with kidney failure who receive dialysis
    worldwide, and this population is growing at a rate of 8% per year. Currently,
    no technology on the market addresses dialysis graft needle injury or graft material
    degradation due to needle trauma. InnAVasc Medical's novel graft design has the
    potential to reduce complications associated with aggressive graft compression
    and inadvertent punctures, thus reducing adverse events and dramatically improving
    patient outcomes and quality of life while significantly reducing health care
    costs related to chronic dialysis graft injury. \n\nThis project will substantially
    advance the development of an innovative device that will simultaneously allow
    for immediate cannulation following graft implantation (typical is to allow 4
    weeks to heal prior to cannulation) and eliminate complications associated with
    repeated cannulation during maintenance hemodialysis. The ultimate goal of this
    proposal is to identify and engineer a suitable biocompatible material that will
    provide the desired mechanical strength to withstand passage of the dialysis needle
    into undesirable areas, while being sufficiently flexible to allow for optimal
    blood flow through the device and adequate conformity for patients of all shapes,
    sizes, and skin integrity. The first technical objective will focus on identifying
    candidate materials and testing their strength, flexibility and durability. The
    second objective will take promising candidate materials and develop prototype
    devices to assess manufacturability and performance. These aims will identify
    a suitable material that will enable the InnAVasc graft to be marketable to the
    broadest patient population. Successful completion of this project will provide
    a prototype device constructed of materials that will simultaneously optimize
    the desired ratio of mechanical strength to flexibility.\n\nThis award reflects

    This SBIR Phase I project advances a novel medical optical spectroscopy device to facilitate accurate diagnosis of middle ear infections.  The device uses a custom multi-LED microchip and photodetectors to illuminate the middle ear and collect reflected light in a familiar otoscope form-factor.   Reflected light signatures are analyzed to determine the presence or absence of middle ear fluid - a hallmark of middle ear infection.  The focus is to optimize product design and algorithm to enable gold standard accuracy across thousands of mass manufactured devices and millions of patients.  The device will be a cost effective means to achieving improved ear infection diagnosis in primary care where it is most needed.  Roughly 90% of children experience at least one ear infection before age 5 and misdiagnosis of suspected ear infection is the leading cause of unnecessary pediatric antibiotic use in the US.  Collectively, ear infection results in at least $5B direct healthcare costs annually in the US and billions more in lost parent productivity.  Improving ear infection diagnosis has the potential to eliminate millions of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions - a crucial step in mitigating development of resistant microorganisms.  Addressing this challenge requires a product that is cost-effective and consistently accurate.

    This project will enable the first commercially available optical spectroscopy product for middle ear effusion and the only known method capable of accurately assessing ear health in very waxy ears.  Although optical spectroscopy as a scientific method is widely practiced, comparatively few commercial medical products exist.  High-cost, bulky spectrometer units are a primary limitation restricting development of products tailored to primary care and other low margin medical specialties where there is great need.  The proposed work enables cost-effective manufacture and deployment of the proposed device for ear infection and will be a platform for other next-generation, LED-based optical spectroscopy medical devices.  The investigators will develop an algorithmic scheme to correct variability in mass manufactured LED and photodiode components and design and construct test systems to automatically apply corrections to each completed medical device assembly.  The resultant methods and systems will enable deployment of medical optical spectroscopy systems at up to 100X lower unit cost as compared to spectrometer based systems.  The resultant device for ear infection will enable clinicians to more easily adhere to American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines for treating ear infections in primary care where there is greatest need.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to develop a novel text simplification technology that will personalize text to the reading level of students. There is a demand for such tools in inclusive and integrated K- 12 classrooms to cater to the needs of students with varying reading levels. This is especially pertinent to English language learners (Els), international students, and Special Education students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive impairments that impede their reading abilities. Existing tools offer one-size-fits-all solutions offering no control over the simplification process. The proposed Personalized Text Simplifier (PeTeS) will adapt texts to the reading levels of individual students, thereby filling a much-needed gap in the marketplace. With over 60% of U.S. K-12 students reading below grade level, the broader impact of the proposed technology will be in improving the literacy of a diverse population. The expected outcomes of using PeTeS will be improved vocabulary acquisition and improved reading and comprehension of texts by ELs and international students. Using PeTeS for reading may lead to better grades and higher graduation rates. PeTeS will also save teachers time on not having to explain texts or translate for students. PeTeS, will complement the instructor and provide additional support to ELs and international students, especially, in content areas, where these students have very little support.

    The proposed PeTeS is envisioned to be an adaptive reading assistant for personalizing instruction. The key innovation of PeTeS is in the application of natural language processing algorithms to perform automatic text simplification to dynamically meet specific reading levels - simplification being defined as an adaptation of any given text in a way that maximizes the likelihood that the student will understand its content. The key idea here is to replace a word that is presumed to be not known by the student with a word that is presumed to be known, i.e., the replacement criteria is the student?s knowledge and not the word complexity. Towards that, the proposed PeTeS technology will maintain a student knowledge model representing the reading level of the student. PeTeS will rely on the model not only to simplify the text to the student's level and improve comprehension, but also to challenge the student to learn unfamiliar words while reading whatever they need to read.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to accelerate the commercialization of organic
    light-emitting diode (OLED) technology.  For color displays (TV, cell phone, computer,

    in terms of energy usage, display color space, viewing angle, etc.  For lighting,
    OLED fixtures use very low energy, the light is soft, casts no shadow, and is
    architecturally flexible.  OLED is the display and lighting technology of the
    future.  However cost and short device lifetime has retarded commercial advancement.
    \ The introduction of an entirely new class of materials for OLED manufacturing
    will enable this advancement. \n\nThe proposed project will reduce OLED cost and
    improve performance by utilizing a new class of photoelectric materials for the
    nanometer thick layers that comprise an OLED.  OLED layers utilize single-component
    small molecules for the charge transporting and light-emitting layers.  These
    molecules tend to crystallize and are poor solvents for the emitting molecules
    leading to decreased light emission efficiency and shortened device lifetime.
    \ The innovation is using isomeric mixtures of designed molecules that are amorphous

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide the biomedical research community with a new tool for next-generation tissue culture platforms, including those derived from patient samples.  If successful, this technology will enable researchers to automate and standardize 3D cell culture techniques in a format that is broadly compatible with current laboratory infrastructure.  It would bridge a gap between commercial biomanufacturing/pharmaceutical development and the academic state-of-the-art.  Moreover, the proposed technology will provide the scientific community with novel tools to perturb and observe how individual cells interact with each other and with their microenvironment.  Probing biological signatures at single-cell resolution underpins major current trends in biomedical research, from clinical applications in cancer therapy, diagnostics, and immunology, to global basic science initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas project.  The goal of this grant is to facilitate commercialization of a single-cell handling instrument for use in research universities and pharmaceutical R&D laboratories.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop an automated instrument for seeding organoids or other 3D tissue cultures with single-cell resolution.  Organoids have the potential to transform personalized medicine and disease modelling, but current culture methods are poorly controlled, leading to wide variability between individual samples and across labs.  It is recognized that standardization, reproducibility, and tight control of cell seeding parameters will be paramount for drawing predictive value from organoids in the clinic, particularly when many statistical replicates are required.  The technology developed is a high-resolution robotic cell printing instrument capable of rapidly and deterministically seeding single cells contained within sub-nanoliter liquid volumes.  The goal is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the proposed cell printing technology to seed organoid cultures with complete control of the type and number of constituent cells in each organoid.  Using Lgr5+ stem cell-derived intestinal organoids as a model culture system, protocols will be developed for preparing "printer-ready" input single stem cells from primary tissue.  Then, the plan is to evaluate the effects of cell seeding state on organoid morphology by varying cell number, cell type and ECM components, to test the hypothesis that controlled seeding will result in improved morphological reproducibility, as assessed by high-content imaging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a cost-effective high-performance platform to monitor and characterize phytoplankton and other microorganisms in water. Some of these aquatic microorganisms may be toxic or even fatal resulting in significant public health concerns (such as recent "red tide" events in Florida, USA) and drastic economic consequences (i.e. deadly effects of harmful algal blooms on the aquaculture industry). The current state of the art in monitoring technology includes laborious and expensive manual sample collection and evaluation using a benchtop microscope or optical digital imaging system. In contrast, the proposed platform will be transformative by enabling low-cost, portable and fast monitoring and automated characterization of aquatic microorganisms. Therefore, this platform will revolutionize monitoring of aquatic microorganisms and, being low cost, it will enable a much wider application of the technology to other markets. Some of these future applications include more efficient biofuels research and development (via algae monitoring), marine biology science and education, general monitoring of particles and pathogens at the water treatment facilities, production algae monitoring. Therefore, the potential societal impact and commercial potential of the proposed technology is transformative.

    The proposed project aims to develop and evaluate a portable, rapid, durable and environmentally-stable imaging flow-cytometry technology that will automatically monitor microorganisms, such as phytoplankton and pathogens present in the flowing water, and will be capable of specific classification. Existing optics-based flow-cytometry solutions are expensive and not durable for field use. Unlike lab-based flow cytometers or hand-held assays, the proposed system will not rely on reagents or labeling, and therefore will not need an expert/professional, and will keep the evaluated water unchanged. Thus, it can be installed for continual unattended operation and will be much more cost-effective per test due to elimination of an expert's time, costly reagents and fluorophores. Furthermore, the proposed system will also be integrated with a machine learning engine capable of automated identification of microorganisms as well as other micro-objects of interest. Finally, the proposed system will be evaluated on pre-collected samples of local coastal ocean water to determine the presence of three example types of phytoplankton microorganisms and to provide statistical distribution of all of the detected micro-objects. Therefore, the proposed system will be transformative and provide an innovative and unique capability to expediently survey samples of water and automatically characterize identified micro objects.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study and develop methods to provide adult professionals and young adult students with the skills and self-confidence to pursue studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields. Today, a large segment of society identifies as being underrepresented in the technology sector. Some individuals experience low technology-related self-confidence as a result. At a time when the United States has an increasing demand for technology workers, the country needs contributions from all segments of society, and not simply those segments which have been privileged in the past, to meet this demand and maintain U.S. competitive advantage in the global innovation economy. Engaging people from the full spectrum of the United States population will enable innovative companies to leverage more diverse sources of creativity, build better solutions to today's problems, and create more jobs. When people see themselves as future practitioners of a technical skill, it is possible to learn topics in a deeper, more fulfilling, and more enduring manner. Commercializing this invention will increase online learning platform retention rates, driving revenue not only within educational companies but within the companies who hire the resulting talent.


    The proposed technology is innovative because no commercially-available software tools exist which support metacognitive development in tandem with technical skill acquisition. This innovation is risky because no one has proven that having a positive influence on metacognition through automated software is even possible during single learning session. The goal of this research is to deliver techniques for enhancing the self-efficacy of STEM learners within the context of online learning platforms. The project combines best practices in digital personalization and educational psychology research to deliver customized content responsive to learner preferences and learner attitude attributes. The proposed research will demonstrate, via a random trial, increased levels of motivation and engagement in students who receive targeted interventions as compared with a control population. Using survey instruments, the researchers will measure changes in self-efficacy, challenge-seeking, and goal-setting behavior. Because the research team has unique experience in developing proven educational interventions which enhance self-efficacy across a variety of learning domains, the algorithms and methods inside the proposed technology will be difficult for competitors to replicate. This SBIR project will deliver algorithms and automated, web-based interventions to help all STEM learners experience personal engagement with STEM topics and find empowerment in the task of learning.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant. Agriculture is one of the most important industries impacting the economy, society, and the environment. By automating harvesting of fresh produce, society's ability to grow healthy and sustainable food will increase substantially. The innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding of how to deploy commercially viable multi-robot coordinated groups performing complex automated tasks, in agriculture and beyond. The long-term opportunity for agricultural robotics is $150B+. This innovation focuses on controlled-environment methods, which are more intensive in terms of capital and labor, but far less intensive in terms of water, chemical use, and fertilizer use. If robots can reduce manual labor of large-scale production, and enhance human management precision, it will enable intensive agriculture practices to compete with, and in some cases supplant, traditional chemical-, labor-, and water-intensive approaches. This will make the US a more competitive global producer of high-quality produce, increase food security, increase access to healthy food for all people, and protect natural resources and the environment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance the fields of Robotic Applications, including computer vision/machine learning and robotics controls, by solving critical problems faced when operating in highly dynamic yet precise biological environments like farms. 1) By evolving and combining approaches from the forefront of computer vision, the project will improve environment sensing of e.g. clusters of fruit, their locations, conditions, precise locations of stems and obstacles. 2) Using that information, the project will develop innovative approaches to complex planning problems where leaves, stems, and obstacles interfere with optimal harvesting but are movable. This will be done with millimeter-level precision, where current autonomous planning approaches operate on multi-centimeter precision. 3) Lastly, the project will combine environmental data with 3D reconstructions of grow operations and individual fruit tracking in order to provide better sampling data to forecast production on a 1-4-week basis, and eventually build a deep learning model. This project is critical to achieving the commercial threshold of performance for robotic harvesting services, including high percent of berries picked, acceptable speed of picking, and the provision of climate sensing and forecast information.

    This SBIR Phase I project focuses on developing an educational platform for improving motivation levels in students with respect to the STEM disciplines, especially Mathematics. The core activity consists of live academic competition, students answering questions in a game-based, online arena. The platform will borrow the features and structures found in popular athletic sports, from points and rankings to leagues and championships, and reproduce them online so that students can compete academically in the classroom just like they compete athletically on the sports field, with similar performance gains and improvements to peer dynamics expected to follow. Leveraging classic game mechanics in an exciting online format, the platform has the potential to motivate students across the skill and demographic spectra where offline academic competitions have historically failed and input or output focused efforts have produced disappointing results. This project offers the chance to approach learning improvement from a new perspective. By focusing directly on student motivation with a structure only recently made possible by the advent of the internet age, this project leverages the power of competition to advance the stated NSF missions of developing a globally competitive STEM workforce and increasing economic competitiveness in the United States.


    This project entails the development of a web and mobile platform with the ability to host and engage every student across the U.S. in robust, online competition activity. As such, the proposed activity is expansive in its breadth and scope and therefore presents an immense challenge, both from a technical and a design perspective. Three distinct roles are imagined: an administrator of the platform will have the ability to create leagues, tournaments, and championships, team-based and individual-based, for students across the school district/network; a teacher on the platform will be able to arrange matches for a team/class of students by dividing them into multiple teams that play against each other or challenging another team in the same school district/network to a match; a student on the platform will be able to arrange individual-based matches with other students in the same school district/network or play against a personal best avatar. Bringing all such activity together into a single platform, one that can be integrated with existing online education platforms and replicated from school district to school district across the U.S. will seamlessly blending together the experiences of very different users.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Virtual Reality (VR) based curriculum for first year university science courses. VR has the potential to create a step change in the way STEM education is taught and ultimately the way students learn. This project aims to build VR science curriculum to make science education more accessible, engaging and effective, and turn traditional STEM leavers into stayers which will positively impact STEM retention to meet the U.S. workforce demand. The VR science curriculum will be used alongside the existing curriculum at universities, with students participating in one 30-minute virtual lesson a week. The effect of these lessons on the students' performance will be measured to validate the ability of VR to positively impact learning outcomes. This project supports the NSF mission by progressing the science of education, by developing education tools using the scientific method, and measuring effectiveness. Moreover, the focus on improving university science education will improve the workforce pipeline, creating more and better prepared scientists. The products resulting from the proposed work will make science more accessible preparing today's students to be tomorrow's inventors, problem solvers and next great minds.

    The intellectual merit of this project is in the approach to developing VR curricula, and continually validating each curriculum by using data science to correlate student performance in the lesson to their performance in the classroom. Each lesson combines exposition, active learning, problem-based inquiry and assessment into self-contained modules which can be added to any existing curriculum. Student actions, and concept mastery are tracked within each lesson; ultimately, to correlate what the student is doing in a VR lesson to their learning outcome in real time. This enables the project team to validate which components of each lesson are working to improve student learning outcomes, and continually refine the VR pedagogy. This approach to developing each lesson and the cycle of refinement is the key innovation of the project team. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the magnitude of learning outcome improvement achieved when VR lessons are added to existing curricula, correlate the student actions in the VR lesson to their learning outcome as measured through in-class assessments, and evaluate perceived implementation hurdles for use of VR by instructors. This will be accomplished by integrating VR lessons in university curriculum and measuring the results against a control group. Instructor feedback will be gathered through a mixed methods study.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on continued development of a software platform that is used by students for peer to peer homework and studying help. After school help has historically been delivered by tutors and homework hotlines but those avenues have been proven to be inadequate in closing learning gaps for students after they exit the classroom. The proposed technology is expected to further democratize homework and studying help. Being peer to peer, the proposed technology can radically shrink the cost of personalized homework and studying help for students at their own time and pace - especially the ones from economically or socially more challenged backgrounds. The project will also explore use of an innovative business model to optimize commercial viability with impacting a broad range of students irrespective of their backgrounds. It is expected that when fully developed, the technology would emerge as a scalable low-cost option to help improve student learning outcomes both nationally and globally.

    The key intellectual merit of this project is in the development of a Smart Study Recommendations Engine. This involves harvesting the data from the class notes uploaded by students, analyze it to surface predictive insights and automatically deliver the notes or wide-ranging peer-reviewed study materials directly to the student users based on their learning styles, learning abilities, and learning gaps, without requiring them to perform a search. It will also provide them with an ability to connect them with peers who can provide additional support. Thus, this project seeks to provide personalized study playlists based on a student profile and pair them with a peer mentor who can provide deeper clarifications as required. The key outcome to be demonstrated is that 1 in 5 students engages favorably with the auto delivered math notes, helped by a peer who can provide clarity and tutoring as needed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will provide new opportunities for purifying waters that cannot be economically treated using existing commercial membranes.  Increased market growth to include recycle and re-use of contaminated water that is currently slated for disposal or long term environmentally risky storage will increase water availability for industry and agriculture and reduce environmental impact from these same users.  More available water, especially in higher demand locations, will lead to higher production and lower costs for industrial and agriculture based consumers, leading to job growth.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to validate a new method of thin film composite membrane fabrication using new materials strategies to produce game changing anti-fouling and chlorine resistant reverse osmosis membranes.  Current market dominating polyamide thin film composite (TFC) membranes are inherently susceptible to fouling and degraded by chlorine disinfectants used to mitigate bio-fouling, which is the greatest challenge to membrane operation.  The established TFC production technique provides very thin active layers on the order of 100?s of nanometers but is limited to polyamides.  The proposed technology will produce TFCs with alternative polymers.  Polymers that are chlorine resistant and inherently non-fouling are targeted for use but the unmet challenge has been the opportunity to manufacture them with membrane thicknesses down to the 100?s of nm thickness regime necessary to challenge the flux properties of current commercial membranes.  Combining this new fabrication technology and new polymers is the technological breakthrough needed to develop innovative membranes.  The project will synthesize a target polymer composition, develop the formulation and fabrication parameters within the new process and produce TFC samples for testing.  TFC samples will undergo comparative testing of fouling and chlorine resistance, water flux and salt rejection in a variety of simulated test waters.

    The proposed broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reduction of waterborne disease from drinking water in low-income populations.  2.1 billion people drink fecally-contaminated water, 50% of hospitalization in developing countries are due to waterborne diseases, and contaminated drinking water causes >500,000 diarrheal deaths each year. Low-income populations not only pay for water, but pay anywhere from 30% to 10 times more in absolute terms than the wealthy. This proposed technical innovation will provide: a consumer packaged goods water filter, i.e. a product priced as a consumable and sold through food/beverage retail grocery stores.  This is a different business model than water filters which are sold as durable good appliances through specialty stores. If successful a new consumer water filter category reaching a fraction of 2.1 B people has potential to represent a $1B+ category. This proposed project would bring the innovation closer to commercialization by creating a more robust performing antimicrobial filter paper through challenge water stress testing.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a nano-silver antimicrobial filter paper through mass-production methods, e.g. paper machines, that is formulated to be biocidal in a wide variety of water sources.  Technical hurdles include the reliability of technology scaling, developing frameworks for quality and stress testing, broader antimicrobial efficacy, and longer use life.  The project goals include engineering a paper formulation with increased silver uptake, more uniform nanoparticle synthesis, synergistic antimicrobial chemicals, and reliable filter paper pore size and flow rate.  The project plan to address these technical challenges include rigorous stress testing with specific challenge chemicals and high microbial loads, development of new formulations based on adding synergistic antimicrobial chemicals, absorbent chemicals to increase silver uptake, and process variations in the operation of the paper machine (speed, temperature, pressing, etc).  These experiments will require new formulations to be evaluated following the same quality and stress tests with each iteration at the bench scale and pilot scale.

    This SBIR Phase I project is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of an innovative crowdfunding process to effectively support and grow the fourth sector economy at the local community level. This fourth sector economy, a blend of three traditional economic sectors (public, private and nonprofit) is poised to solve many of the world's most difficult and complex social problems; however, this sector cannot work effectively without a supportive ecosystem that enables the creation, funding, and operation of organizations within it. This project proposes an innovative Fourth Sector Ecosystem incubator that brings a coordinated suite of services to local communities to engage them, educate them, and provide financial capital through a crowdfunding platform. This project will engage four communities in a pilot study designed to engage and educate key leaders, energize advocacy for fourth-sector growth, and catalyze fourth-sector social enterprises by offering capital access through crowdfunding. The validation of this grass-roots scalable educational and participatory incubator will enable communities to support local for-benefit businesses who will improve the quality of life in their communities, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, leading to expansion of this model across the nation and globally.


    The innovation inherent in this educational platform is the synergy between the components of its scalable, turnkey process to provide a catalyst for fourth-sector business growth. Innovative components include a robust, secure crowdfunding platform, educational training for community leaders and businesses in fourth-sector principles, assessment methods to evaluate/provide continuous improvement of the process, gamification that rewards fourth-sector-supporting behaviors; and network-building processes. The goals of this research are to determine the performance, design and educational training specifications that will address the needs of all stakeholders (e.g., entrepreneurs, community leaders, contributors), and demonstrate the feasibility of this platform through a pilot study in four communities. Methods will focus on continuous evaluation and feedback from stakeholders in the four communities to determine best methods to teach communities to manage their incubators, activate their communities to participate, achieve campaign success, demonstrate improved learning outcomes from the training, and increase the density and reciprocity of networks in the pilot communities. Surveys and data will be collected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each component in the process, from planning to implementation to assessment, as shown through survey results, expansion of networks, and funding raised by fourth sector enterprises using the crowdfunding tool.

    This SBIR Phase I project will provide children ages 7-11 years with an interactive learning program that cultivates core leadership skills. This project goes deeper than many traditional socio-emotional programs by fortifying children with the behavioral skills and mindset they need to evolve as effective leaders. The educational curriculum was developed by psychologists who specialize in leadership development, and is based on cutting-edge child developmental, leadership, and educational research. This project aims to research the engagement and effectiveness of the program and its ability to enhance ten core leadership behaviors in youth, at home, in the community, and in academic settings. This program has the potential to make a long-term impact on the next generation of youth, promoting resilience in the face of adverse events, such as school violence and cyberbullying, and to positively shape the next generation of leaders, helping them form lifelong commitments to personal and professional development. The project has philanthropic aspirations to make the educational curriculum available to all children and schools, regardless of socio-economic standing, supporting the mission of NSF to promote the health, prosperity and welfare of the nation through science.


    This project is focused on the development of an interactive leadership program for children, that is proven to make a positive impact on leadership behaviors and that is also fun and engaging for youth and their adult caregivers and educators. What sets this program apart from others is that the research will provide evidence that the program builds the critical skills it intends on developing in children. The program is designed to be self-led or facilitated by an adult caregiver or educator, either using an online platform or physical materials.  As children move from one leadership competency to another, they are extrinsically and intrinsically rewarded for their efforts. Adult caregivers and educators are encouraged to participate and are provided mastery building exercises that help them take the child?s leadership understanding and skill to the next level. A database has been developed to track real-time participant feedback as curriculum elements are developed. The testing of educational content will focus on three aspects, which include maximizing content appropriateness, validating learning and skill retention, and assessing variances and preferences for mode of delivery. Results will be used to make modifications to the curriculum and product design for commercialization.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I Project will productize a quantitative data processing
    technology in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). Dynamic PET's distinction
    from its static counterpart is in the fact that it collects time-dependent tracer
    concentration data. It is a highly sensitive and accurate way of functional and
    molecular imaging of protein targets such as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease,
    Parkinson's disease, or brain trauma. Unfortunately, dynamic PET is rarely used
    in clinic because of long imaging time and complex processing. The technology
    to be developed in this proposal will shorten the required imaging time and simplify
    the analysis, allowing for accurate and reliable imaging of disease biomarkers
    for aiding drug development, clinical diagnostics, and treatment monitoring. The
    proposed analytic workflow will be offered as a cloud-based service that can be
    used by the customers to analyze new or historical PET datasets. In order to overcome
    the established practice of relying on less accurate and informative static PET
    imaging, the grant recipients plan to conduct a thorough validation of the new
    technology using a dedicated physical phantom and human subject images acquired
    in the past. The largest impact of the new technology is expected in medical research
    and drug development. \n\nThe accepted practice of analyzing dynamic PET datasets
    involves reconstruction of the parameters of implied compartment model describing
    the tracer biochemistry, which involves several accuracy-degrading approximations
    and requires lengthy acquisition. The alternative approach proposed in this project
    relies on decomposing the dynamic PET image sequences using a combination of several
    processing techniques that incorporate the essential features of tracer pharmacokinetics
    without making explicit assumptions about the model parameters or about the underlying
    anatomy. The key part of the proposed methodology is factor analysis of dynamic
    structures, a non-negative matrix decomposition technique with successful past
    applications in radionuclide image analysis. The result of the workflow is a 3D
    concentration of tissues that exhibit specific-binding of the radiotracer. In
    order to validate the quantitative accuracy of the approach, the researchers will
    build and image a dedicated physical phantom capable of producing overlapping
    distributions with different tracer dynamics. In order to validate the scan-time
    reduction claims, the new workflow will be used to analyze existing dynamic PET
    human subject datasets using increasingly shorter input time windows.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Transfer (STTR) project is the advancement of improved lithium ion batteries.
    The project will evaluate new battery chemistry enabling more rapid charging rates
    then currently available in the worldwide energy storage marketplace. Such high
    power density batteries would cater to a major emerging battery segment where
    current lithium ion battery technologies fall dramatically short. Successful development
    of this innovation will provide benefits to both current and future applications.
    Clearly, large scale deployment of a markedly superior energy storage device will
    have significant societal benefits by accelerating the move away from fossil fuel
    in many applications and products. For instance, a viable regenerative braking
    energy storage technology based on the proposed technology would result in a tremendous
    reduction in electricity used by subway trains, with a concomitant reduction of
    CO2 emissions. \n\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to address the core of the
    microstructure - performance relations in energy storing materials, answering
    a series of fundamental questions regarding how a charge carrier is reversibly
    or irreversibly stored at high rates in manganese oxide - carbon nanocomposite
    anodes. In conventional LIBs, it is the graphite-based anode that limits charging
    rates, with catastrophic lithium metal plating and dendrite growth occurring at
    increased currents. It is expected that many of the existing \"Graphite - Inherited\"

    and manufacturing scalability along with fabrication and testing of near-commercial
    pouch cell form factors in order to demonstrate device-level performance and commercial
    viability of the proposed technology.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop an external stent that can improve the quality and length of life for dialysis patients. Dialysis is the primary lifeline for End-Stage Renal Disease patients. Unfortunately, our current standard of care, which provides no additional support or treatment to the artery-vein connections surgically created in the arm to initiate dialysis (i.e. access sites), results in 40-60% failure rates within the first year. Consequences of these failures are dire: significant pain, suffering, and death for dialysis patients, hospital readmission penalties, and more than $1B in direct costs to Medicare. An external stent that wraps around the vein-artery/-graft junction of dialysis patients at the time of access site creation surgery has been developed to reduce these failures in a preventative fashion. In order to maximize the impact that it can have on the lives of dialysis patients by providing favorable flow conditions (i.e. hemodynamics) through the access site, it is imperative to first optimize device design on the bench with the aid of computational modeling. Findings from this grant will further scientific understanding of external supports and the role that hemodynamics play in access site failures.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to create a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model that successfully predicts flow and deformation conditions at the access site in the presence or absence of an external stent, and to use this model to identify external stent design parameters that promote the most favorable hemodynamic environment for preventing access site failures. First, a 3D printing method of manufacture will be optimized to enable the fabrication of external stents in a highly-repeatable manner conducive to large-scale, FDA-compliant production. A CFD model will be created from empirical results in which surgically-constructed anastomoses (e.g. vein-graft junctions) are exposed to arteriovenous-mimetic pressure and flow conditions in the absence or presence of external stent designs. Empirical ex vivo data to validate the CFD model simulation results will be collected from quantitative measurements of dynamic deformation (e.g. magnitude of expansion) and flow patterns (i.e. velocity fields) in the presence or absence of various external stent designs via 4D flow MRI, which provides spatial and temporal information on 3D flow over the entire anastomosis. This work should result in the identification of a few designs that assert hemodynamic effects conducive to reducing neointimal hyperplasia, the primary culprit of access site failures.

    light required to inactivate common clinical pathogens known to cause surgical
    site infections, and test a prototype antimicrobial light emitting dressing that
    uses the bactericidal effects of blue light to inactivate surface colonizing bacteria
    and disinfect surgical sites. The potential outcomes of the proposed activity
    are the development of a thin reusable blue light-emitting bandage that provides
    effective post-operative site disinfection, ultimately reducing nosocomial related
    infections. The proposed activity would further the development of antimicrobial
    blue light therapy devices, providing novel solutions to surgical site infections,
    Central Line Bloodstream Associated Infections, and wound infections, because
    of blue light therapy's proven ability to inactivate a wide range of clinical
    pathogens regardless of their resistance to antibiotics, ability to improve wound
    healing, and ability to inactivate bacteria in the biofilm state. The outcomes
    of this project will aid in providing a cost saving solution to Healthcare Associated
    Infections by reducing their occurrence, reducing the risks of human error, and
    improving accountability, quality and workflow. \n\nOptimization of blue light
    therapy is needed for clinical application for killing bacteria on the surface
    of patient's surgical sites, because of a radiant energy threshold that must be
    passed to inactivate bacteria. Due to the variation in devices and doses used
    in previous studies, combined with the clinical need for a device which can be
    easily incorporated into standard infection prevention protocols, further experimentation
    is needed with a device designed as a wearable for clinical implementation.  Objective
    1: Determine optimal light dose (fluence) of blue light (405 nm) required to inactivate
    common gram positive and gram negative bacteria known to cause SSIs. Using in
    vitro techniques, determine the total fluence of light and treatment times required
    to achieve bacterial disinfection of at least a one log reduction in bacteria
    colony forming units.  Objective 2: Optimize device to deliver the effective irradiance
    while maintaining surface temperature below 43 Degree Celsius for safe use on
    tissue. The device is to not exceed 43 Degree Celsius on the surface of the device's
    therapeutic surface while delivering effective irradiance, from Objective 1, for
    inactivation of bacteria on surfaces.  Objective 3: Test the device's infection

    a porcine SSI model with surface-inoculated sutured incisions, made to the depth
    of the fascia, with optimized light-emitting antimicrobial bandage. Success criteria
    for bacterial disinfection is at least a 90% reduction of CFU per gram of tissue

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    project is to improve outcomes and decrease costs in the mental health space by engaging
    patients starting with their first therapy session through objective progress reporting and
    post-session motivation. Patients and clinicians alike will be able to track and assess treatment
    progress through self-reported and physiological measures. This innovation builds upon the
    strong academic, government, and industry partnerships that will advance research and
    innovation in the field of biotechnology. By demonstrating improved outcomes and decreased
    costs associated with the utilization of technology, this will pave the way for insurance
    reimbursement (using existing CPT codes) to accelerate market adoption. Additionally, as
    education of patients and the public improves regarding mental health and PTSD in particular,
    the negative stigma surrounding these conditions will decrease and more people in need will
    seek help rather than resorting to unhealthy behavior or even suicide.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to represent an innovative approach that provides easy to
    interpret results tailored to mental health providers, patients, and other non-technical users.
    Current mental health treatment and assessment has lacked qualitative, scientifically-based
    measurement. The need for a scientific measurement is evident, as about 8 percent of all
    adults - 1 of 13 people in this country will develop PTSD during their lifetime. Currently, 60%
    of adults diagnosed with a mental illness don't receive mental health treatment; using proven
    science and physiologic measurements as the foundation for improving treatment and
    monitoring progress for PTSD can help to alleviate some of the stigma surrounding mental
    illnesses. This project aims to demonstrate how implementing a web-based platform can
    improve PTSD treatment by providing physiologically relevant feedback to the patient and by
    providing a tool for the clinician to tailor the therapy to the individual patient. Patients will have
    their subjective measures and physiological data visualized throughout treatment on a software
    platform, with progress being tracked through validated assessment scales. Patients will be
    compared to others in treatment as usual. Results should yield improved quality of life and
    decrease long term healthcare costs for those that use the platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project extends from years of research into the impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), and yet there is still no direct, field assay for toxic cells. The identification of HABs is critical to determine their patterns of occurrence, to protect water and food supplies, and to alert the general public when there is a problem. Harmful Algal Blooms are a world-wide fresh water, brackish water and marine phenomena that occur in every coastal and inland country and annually cause significant economic damage and take human lives. The detection of HABs and their toxins is currently completed by complex, expensive, and time consuming microscopic analyses that do not necessarily provide the critical and timely information that water quality mangers require. Raman spectroscopy provides a strong and distinct fingerprint of HAB cells and their toxins without the need for sample preparation, and can be used on-site at beaches, drinking water reservoirs, or within distributed networks of Raman sensors all communicating through the cloud to provide managers immediate and spatially distinct information on the presence and concentration of potentially toxic cells.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop and market an in-situ 3D microscope with on-axis Raman spectroscopy to provide both morphological information and a chemical signature for identification of HAB cells to species, and in some cases specific strains, along with the presence and concentration of toxin on a per cell basis. The novel technical specifications include: 1) the use of Light Field (LF) microscopy to maximize the depth of field to allow for detection of low cell concentrations (< 1 cell/ mL). LF microscopy also provides a 3D image for more complete and accurate morphological assessment of cells and particulates, 2) Advanced software for color and texture feature extraction and classification of cells using Gabor wavelets and a novel color angle feature, which provide 100% classification accuracy in many cases, 3) the use of Resonance Micro-Raman Spectroscopy (RMRS) to collect spectral fingerprints on the inorganic and organic content of cells, particulates and dissolved compounds, and 4) the integration of these technologies into sensor packages as part of the IoT cloud computing thrust that is sure to gain traction over the next few years, and will provide regional protection of both large and small drinking water reservoirs, globally.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this STTR project stems
    from the costs to U.S. food producers of outbreaks of animal diseases.  Producers
    of poultry, pork, and other food proteins lose more than $1B each year to infectious
    diseases, including some that are transmitted through the air.  For diseases having
    an airborne transmission route, protective technologies that are available are
    few and can be costly to implement and operate.  This project furthers the development
    of a new alternative technology, non-thermal plasmas, for the simultaneous removal
    and inactivation in air of the organisms responsible for the transmission of disease
    to livestock.  This project evaluates how conditions in the environment typically
    found near livestock affect the performance of non-thermal plasmas.  This project
    also pursues a technique for accelerating the process of improving non-thermal
    plasma performance, upon the completion of which new and improved non-thermal
    plasma devices can be developed for applications such as this more rapidly than
    is possible now.  Completion of the project will enable the development of lower-cost
    protective technologies for maintaining livestock health, making such technologies
    economically accessible to a larger segment of food protein producers, ultimately
    lowering food costs and increasing domestic food security.  \n\nThis STTR Phase
    I project proposes to experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness
    of a non-thermal plasma (NTP) as a means of preventing disease-carrying particles
    in outside air from infecting livestock housed in animal confinement buildings.
    \  NTPs are stable electrical discharges that simultaneously contribute to the
    removal of airborne particles while also subjecting them to chemical attack capable
    of killing harmful viruses.  While NTPs have been demonstrated for disinfection
    of fixed surfaces, and to a lesser degree for the destruction of chemical contaminants
    or biological pathogens in air, the intellectual merit of this project stems from
    its evaluation of trace gases commonly present in the air around livestock, ammonia
    and hydrogen sulfide, and their potential to both enhance and diminish the performance
    of NTPs used in farm environments.   Additionally, this project will identify
    non-biological tracers suitable for use in NTP optimization testing which will
    accelerate the development of improved designs.  Two separate lab-scale NTP reactors
    will be used in the execution of the project.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    Broader Impacts: The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project include improving food security, while at the same time enhancing the economic viability and environmental sustainability of large-scale production agriculture. In order to improve crop varieties, agricultural production, and sustainability of farming, there is an urgent need for better technologies to acquire under-canopy plant trait and health data. Examples of high-value under-canopy data include emergence, stem width, corn ear height, plant life-cycle events like flowering and fruiting, and symptoms of pathogens, diseases, and nutrient deficiency. Because these data cannot be obtained by aerial imaging, under-canopy data collection has dramatically greater actionability and value compared to aerial data. However no cost-effective, scalable ways of collecting this data are currently available. In fact, the state of the art is manual data collection by crop scientists (and their students or interns), agronomists, crop-scouts or farmers - an extremely labor intensive, and therefore expensive way of collecting this highly valuable data. Our work will greatly enhance the availability of under-canopy data from field crops. The commercial value of the field data for crop breeding is in excess of $50 Million/year for breeding major row-crops in the US.

    Intellectual Merits: This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate the technical feasibility of autonomously collecting under-canopy data from field crops using TerraSentia, our low-cost ground robot. In preliminary work, we have built the robot hardware, demonstrated its ability to collect high-value plant data from row-crop fields, and analyze it to generate plant-trait information. In the proposed work, we will enable and demonstrate the ability of TerraSentia to collect data autonomously throughout the season. We will demonstrate the technical feasibility of fusing information from low-cost LIDAR, GPS, and vision. We will also demonstrate the feasibility using real-time control algorithms to adapt camera perspective and robot path in order to obtain the highest quality information from the complex and dynamic under- canopy field environments. These high-risk innovations will together enable long-term deployment of TerraSentia for effective data collection and phenotyping, benefiting crop scientists and agricultural product development professionals.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this project is to address the need for a small, low-cost, and high-accuracy angular rate and angular orientation sensor (also known as a gyroscope) for a wide range of applications.  Gyroscopes are desired by many emerging applications such as inertial measurement units for small satellites such as CubeSats, autonomous vehicles, drones, and high-end wearable electronics.  These applications require a gyroscope with a similar price (< $10) but ~10,000 times better accuracy than those currently used in smartphones.  The birdbath resonator gyroscope (BRG) is a novel micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscope with a strong potential to satisfy the needs of these applications due to significantly better resonance quality and mechanical symmetry than current silicon gyroscopes.  The economic impact of BRGs will be enormous since many industries can utilize high-performance gyroscopes to monitor the dynamics of their systems, provide positional awareness, and improve the performance of other parts of these systems.  Availability of low-cost and high-performance gyroscopes will enable users to further understand their applications and explore their limits and applicability across a broad range of societal needs.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a new batch-level microfabrication technology to enable the commercialization of low-cost, very high-performance MEMS gyroscope from fused-silica.  Gyroscopes available today are either accurate but large and expensive (example: hemispherical resonator gyroscope), or small and cheap but inaccurate (example: smartphone gyroscopes).  High-accuracy silicon MEMS gyroscopes in research are small and accurate but expensive.  This is because silicon has fundamentally low mechanical resonance quality factor (Q) so it is difficult to manufacture high-accuracy gyroscopes with a high yield.  The BRG is a gyroscope made from fused-silica and capable of having low cost, small size, and high performance.  Its fused silica micro mechanical resonator can achieve significantly higher Q than silicon, which allows the BRG to be manufactured with a high yield.  The BRG fabrication process uses a blowtorch to reflow-mold a fused silica substrate into three-dimensional hollow shells with dimensions of several 10s of micrometers to several millimeters with high geometrical accuracy.  The proposed research will significantly enhance our understanding of the relationships among size, design, and process on the performance of the BRG as well as the relationship among detailed process parameters, yield and reproducibility on cost.

  title: 'SBIR Phase I:  Commercialization of low-cost micro birdbath resonant gyroscope'
- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project will develop a very long-acting buprenorphine
    formulation to increase patient compliance and address the opioid crisis. Poor
    medication compliance is a significant driver of health care costs. The US would
    save an estimated 290 billion dollars yearly or 13% of the total health care budget
    if patients took their medications as directed. Patients with chronic diseases
    are the least compliant with medication. There is an evolving consensus that Opioid
    Misuse Disorder (OMD) is also a chronic disease, and its treatment is also plagued
    by poor compliance. There are an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States
    with OMD. Complete abstinence therapy fails about 80% of the time. Medication-assisted
    therapy using methadone, naltrexone or buprenorphine is far more successful. More
    opioid misuse patients are treated with buprenorphine than methadone, and retention
    in treatment is up to 78% with additional counseling. Still, 80% of all people
    who misuse opioids never obtain any therapy for their disorder, risking overdose,
    other diseases, including HIV and Hepatitis, and amyloidosis. Extended-release
    medications for opioid maintenance therapy would open up more options to get people
    into therapy. A 3-month release formulation of buprenorphine would be a part of
    that strategy.  \n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist opioid drug that is used
    for treatment of pain in human and animal patients and for opioid addiction maintenance.
    A platform technology has been developed that can be used to formulate extended-release
    preparations of drugs that are weak bases and are mildly lipophilic. Preparations
    of buprenorphine, naltrexone and doxycycline have been developed using this method.
    The initial proposed product is an injectable formulation of buprenorphine that
    releases over a period of 3 months. This project will address the occurrence of
    a brief peak of early drug release in the 3-month duration buprenorphine formulation.
    The experiments in the current proposal will examine three different methods of
    decreasing the early peak by manipulating the amount of lipid engulfed by macrophages
    at a given dose of drug or by preventing macrophage engulfment of the lipid particles
    entirely by coating the lipid particles with chemicals that make them unlikely
    to be phagocytized. Preliminary results indicate that changing the drug to lipid
    ratio as described in the current proposal will reduce the peak of early release.
    Reducing the early peak will prevent sedative effects, improve the pharmacokinetics
    of the preparation and make dose escalation studies easier and more straight forward.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review
    criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project scales the production of renewable monomers that give access to performance nylon polyamides with tailorable functional properties for applications in the automotive, food & beverage packaging, textiles, and other industries. The revolutionary technology will be a disruptive force to the $40 billion nylon polyamide industry by addressing nylon?s weaknesses such as undesired moisture adsorption, which results in loss of dimensional stability and tensile strength. These shortcomings lead industries to make compromises in selecting their materials; for instance, longer chain polyamides are used for moisture resistance but at the expense of desired viscoelastic properties. The proposed bio-advantaged monomers will 1) help ease reliance on petroleum-based chemicals resulting in greener production processes and a cleaner environment, 2) present new opportunities for innovation and use of performance plastics due to the platform that bio-advantaged monomers offer. This is expected to generate new jobs at multiple points in the value chain. Demand for agricultural goods by fermentation facilities will increase. Sumatra Biorenewables and its partners will create jobs to meet demand for monomer production and purification. Finally, polymer producers and the manufacturing industry will produce superior products, increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. chemical industry.

    The intellectual merit of this project is to combine fermentation and chemical conversion for the production of bio-advantaged monomers and their corresponding performance-enhanced polyamides. The inexpensive, robust, and efficient monomer production process in conjunction with the customizable nature of bio-advantaged monomers to yield nylon derivatives that are hydrophobic, flame retardant, anti-static, or otherwise tailorable, afford opportunities to meet a number of needs in the manufacturing sector. The innovation?s success hinges on a monomer production process that utilizes an inexpensive electrochemical conversion that operates near 100% efficiency and that only uses water as a reactant and electricity as an energy source. In addition, the monomer production process is insensitive to the feedstock source and the impurities present in fermentation broths. Therefore, separation and purification is only required after monomer production, resulting in huge cost savings. Laboratory-tested samples of hydrophobic nylon perform equally well as dry nylon, but without the disadvantage of moisture sensitivity. This project will enable Sumatra Biorenewables to transition to a continuous flow, kilogram-scale, production process and supply potential customers with samples for performance testing.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    the commercial viability of using new non-precious metal catalysts to produce
    hydrogen by splitting water.  Electrolyzers made with these new catalysts have
    the potential to deliver higher efficiencies and lower capital costs than currently
    available systems. The market for hydrogen today is $115 billion per year.  Currently,
    hydrogen is primarily produced via steam reformation of methane. Hydrogen production
    via steam reformation emits millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually.
    There is broad agreement that water electrolysis can play a significant role in
    future hydrogen production if cost reductions can be realized.  In addition, hydrogen
    has the potential to store energy produced by renewable energy systems like solar
    and wind and make it available on demand. The initial market entry point for these
    new electrolyzers is to supply hydrogen for fuel cell powered forklifts used in
    material handling. A life cycle cost analysis by the National Renewable Energy
    Laboratory (NREL) has shown that the total life cycle costs of hydrogen fuel cell
    forklifts are 10% cheaper than those using lead acid batteries. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is focused on the ability of new earth-abundant non-precious
    metal catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution
    reaction (OER) to dramatically lower costs while improving efficiency in water
    splitting. The HER electrocatalyst is composed of hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    the OER electrocatalyst is nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide. The preferred operating
    pH for the catalysts are different (pH 7 for the hyper-thin FeS2 nano-discs and
    pH 14 for the nanoamorphous Ni0.8:Fe0.2 oxide). Preliminary data shows that these
    two catalysts with the dual-pH membrane can effectively split water with a total
    overpotential of only 300 mV (1.53 V in a two electrode configuration). This is
    more than 50 mV lower than the best-known precious metal catalysts, Pt and IrOx,
    used in current commercial electrolyzers. The project will continue the optimization
    of these catalysts in the dual-pH electrolyzer stack and also determine if stability
    and lifetime meet commercial requirements\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is a system that provides improved reservoir productivity through a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly method. This method will use an electric impulse to increase reservoir permeability, and decrease industry reliance on alternative methods like hydraulic fracturing, which requires hazardous chemicals to be pumped into the subsurface. Residents in regions where fracking techniques are utilized have commonly been impacted by induced seismicity and landslides as a consequence of pumped in chemicals lubricating faults, making earth ruptures more likely to occur. Additionally, the material and operation time for reservoir stimulation techniques makes the current process expensive. The ability to increase permeability with an electric impulse will avoid the environmental concerns associated with current methods, and will proved a cost competitive reservoir stimulation solution due to a short operational time.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel low-frequency impulse method (LFIM) that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping of material into the subsurface. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within sediment pores.  This program will 1) simulate the processes taking place in the reservoir using computer simulation model, 2) perform experimental analysis of the effects of the electric treatment on different core samples, and 3) determine applicability of the method to different types of the reservoirs located in the United States.  Therefore, this project will identify the optimum sites, where LFIM can boost geothermal performance and oil & gas production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the reuse of rubber compounds from spent tires in high performance products including new tires without significant loss in product performance. Only a very small portion of those tires are currently being ground up for this purpose because of the detrimental impact  on product properties. However, larger quantities could potentially be used if the ground rubber is treated by the process of our invention. This would have several benefits.  Manufacturers could reduce material cost, the rubber recycling industry would enjoy significant growth and unsightly tire dumps with associated pollution problems would disappear. Additionally, the tire industry will become more sustainable and other unacceptable uses of old tires currently practiced, such as their use as fuels in low cost operations, would be financially challenged as novel, more profitable uses that retain the integrity of the polymer matrix emerge.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to build upon studies conducted by our company during the last few years. While it was widely known that recycled ground rubber will significantly reduce physical properties, limited information and understanding existed on the basic causes. Much hope was pinned by many companies and academic institutions on the potential merit of the ground up rubber but no significant commercial process previously emerged. This work aims to develop a recycling process which does not require a devulcanization step. This was first demonstrated with model sample geometries that simulate the environment which ground rubber particles experience when added to and being co-vulcanized with fresh rubber compounds.

    on developing a  plasma jet printing technology to serve the printed electronics
    industry. Printed electronic devices including flexible electronics and flexible
    hybrid electronics (FHE) are next generation smart devices that have applications
    in both consumer and industrial segments. These devices combine the flexibility
    and low cost of printed substrates made of plastic with the performance of semiconductor
    devices to create a new category of electronics. The main challenge in FHE is
    integration of semiconductor die to the flexible substrate and interconnects.
    Plasma jet printing has high potential to address the problems associated with
    printed electronics manufacturing, in particular the interconnects. The plasma
    process control allows printing metallic materials with required electronic properties
    by in-situ treatment, thereby eliminating the need for post processing. The global
    market for printed electronics equipment is $1.5 billion in 2017 and is estimated
    to reach $4 billion globally in 2020 and growing at a compound annual growth rate
    of 38%. Immediate industrial application of our technology is in replacing wire
    bonding with direct write printing of metallic interconnects for flexible hybrid
    electronics. \n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in developing a plasma
    jet print head hardware for direct write printing of conducting metallic interconnects
    with reduced process steps.  The project focus will be on technological de-risking
    of the print head hardware and process de-risking for reliable and re-producible
    printing. Developing the plasma process that can be used for pre-treatment of
    substrate, in-situ treatment of nanoparticles, printing and post processing all
    in one tool and simultaneously can reduce the process steps, number of equipments
    needed and time taken for manufacturing. Oxidation of metal nanoparticle ink and
    its limited shelf life is currently being addressed by polymer capping of the
    nanoparticles and thermal/laser processing. Developing a plasma process that can
    be used to print high quality conducting patterns using in-situ treatment can
    take the technology closer to adoption by printed electronics industry. The anticipated
    outcome of this project is a robust plasma jet print head and a process that can
    reliably and reproducibly print conducting metal films with tailored oxidation

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to enable accurate electronic health record (EHR)-based studies to support precision medicine. The country is embarking on a journey of using real world evidence (RWE) to adjust the existing standard of care. EHR-based subgroup analytics and comparative effectiveness studies will increasingly be used to augment regulatory and reimbursement approval. These efforts require accurately recognizing clinical outcomes in real world scenarios. Studies attempting to identify real world outcomes, such as pain and disease free survival, have shown low accuracy rates in claims and EHR discrete data. This proposal aims to accurately detect challenging outcomes from EHR data using advanced semantic technologies. The goal is to enable accurate RWE studies to achieve safer and more effective use of RWE in clinical practice.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an application to extract clinical outcomes from real world data to enable EHR-based pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs). The approach uses natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the health record for exposure, intervention, and outcome data that do not exist or are inaccurate in claims and EHR discrete data. Project objectives include extracting features from clinical data using NLP and ontologic mapping, developing a knowledge database that reflects common outcomes in observational and clinical trials, and inferring outcome from extracted features using clinical data. The project will validate the outcome detection engine using de-identified longitudinal clinical data to assess accuracy of feature extraction and inferred outcome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the improvement of public transportation services for people with disabilities, specifically people with visual impairments. Individuals with visual impairments are heavily dependent on public transit as an essential service for engaging in daily life and social activities. However, they often face challenges with (1) determining which bus to board, especially at busy bus stops when multiple buses approach, and (2) boarding the correct bus in a timely fashion before they leave the stop. By developing an advanced notification service for alerting bus drivers, SeeingBus will address the societal and market needs to mitigate these challenges and thereby promote independent use of public transportation among people with visual impairments. Improving accessibility of public transportation to people with disabilities along with enhancing perception of their service will boost ridership resulting in increased revenue for agencies. The project will contribute to the scientific community as well as society in general by advancing understanding of Smart City services needed for independent travel of people with disabilities.

    The proposed project will develop and commercialize a Smart City service to improve public transportation for people with visual impairments. The service, SeeingBus, provides an advanced notification to bus drivers about users waiting at their next stop. People with visual impairments often miss buses due to challenges they face with boarding the correct bus. SeeingBus aims to improve accessibility of public transportation by engaging bus drivers even before the bus arrives at the stop where riders with visual impairments are waiting. As part of the smart city vision, SeeingBus will enhance connectivity of public transportation systems through greater communication between riders, bus stops, and bus drivers by means of smart sensors. Using big data, SeeingBus alerts bus drivers about users with disabilities, so the drivers can assist individuals in boarding the bus safely. The research objective of this project is to develop and test the feasibility of the SeeingBus system. Advancing public transportation, essential to promoting the travel and independence of individuals, aligns with the NSF mission to advance prosperity and welfare through scientific advancements.

    This SBIR Phase I project takes a deeper look at the concept of 'purpose' and its relationship to the marketplace, unemployment, and start-up incubators. It intends to develop a multi-question self-assessment tool to help individuals find meaningful purpose through free, online, live and self-paced hybrid course instruction. The coursework will use augmented reality and 3-D video to motivate individuals to re-think purpose as a central motivation to employment and entrepreneurship. This project aligns with the NSF?s mission to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare with science and technology. These outcomes could potentially generate a new generation of business owners that are dedicated to meaning and money through a double bottom-line approach to entrepreneurship.

    This project combines the educational work of finding purpose through self- help and the technology of 3-D video and augmented reality for the first time. This unique project provides free online live synchronous education combined with hybrid self-paced online course work to help individuals find meaningful self-employment solutions. This project utilizes a proprietary training method designed to quickly help individuals find their purpose in life and invent a useful business or nonprofit to solve problems in the world. This research can help students re-center their motivations to chart a meaningful life course through a business or nonprofit start-up. The curriculum starts with this activity and extends to provide students an opportunity to enter the marketplace through micro-enterprise or nonprofit creation. The courses will utilize predictive analytics to synthesize student data (such as the answers each student inputs for the four questions in the purpose activity). The data will be reorganized and automated into a clear and targeted purpose proposition statement for the student.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the commercialization of a fermentation bioprocess that can bring significant benefits for the dairy industry - called the WheyAway system. By initially addressing the problem of handling acid whey, a waste stream generated by all Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers - the WheyAway can convert the cost of waste handling into a revenue by producing valuable bio-oil platform chemicals. The WheyAway can economically convert the acid whey waste stream to bio-oil on-site, allowing our customers to effectively install biorefineries at each of their plants. In comparison to anaerobic digestion, the WheyAway system can provide several multiples greater economic value. These bio-oils can be used as biofuel feedstocks, animal feed additives, and specialty chemicals. Converting acid whey yields a significant market opportunity with projected impact that could simultaneously offset ~435,000 gallons of diesel used to truck this waste off-site and eliminate ~18,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being emitted to the atmosphere. In the future, this bioprocess can be tuned to address other dairy processing streams, allowing the WheyAway to provide value to stakeholders across the entire dairy production value chain.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to scale-up and optimize a novel fermentation bioprocess called the WheyAway system, and can economically convert acid whey waste into valuable platform chemicals, to provide value to Greek yogurt and cottage cheese producers. Plan is to scale to maximize bio-oil production and conversion efficiency through system optimization. A key focus will be to lower the capital cost for the extraction process. Through the tasks proposed for this SBIR, objectives to scale to a 5x larger reactor, lower operating expense by 20%, and lower the capital cost of the currently expensive bio-oil extraction process by 10x. Additionally, potential to convert other dairy process streams, such as sweet whey, will be evaluated, which could unlock larger opportunities in the dairy production value chain.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop customizable cell/tissue culture platforms using a new class of 3D printable bisphenol A-free polycarbonate (BFP) materials and a rapid 3D printing system. The 3D cell culture market was valued at $683 million in 2017 with an exponential projected growth in revenue valued at $1.7 billion by 2022. The rapid growth in this sector is primarily driven by the demand for custom-made 3D cell/tissue models that more accurately recapitulate the human in vivo biology in comparison to conventional animal models and planar cell culture systems. 3D cell/tissue models have the potential to provide more physiologically relevant responses for the drug discovery industry which is estimated to reach $86 billion in 2022. The proposed strategy of using BFP and a fully integrated benchtop 3D printing system will facilitate the production of different cell/tissue culture platforms on demand and enable rapid iteration of different designs to drive forward the development of more clinically relevant cell/tissue models for a broad market in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biological studies.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in: (1) the development of novel 3D printable BFP materials with tunable material properties using green chemistry, and (2) the rapid 3D printing of customizable cell/tissue culture prototypes to support various 3D cell/tissue models. The material development will include the establishment of a reagent library and optimization of the green chemistry process. The relevant material properties such as stiffness, elasticity, optical transparency, and small molecule adsorption will be characterized and optimized. These materials will then be printed using a rapid light-based 3D printer to prototype cell/tissue culture platforms followed by evaluation of their performance. In particular, 3D printing precision and resolution will be characterized and optimized by varying a range of fabrication parameters such as light exposure time and intensity. Next, the efficacy of the prototypes under cell culture conditions will be assessed based on device integrity, material degradation, as well as changes in mechanical and optical properties. Various cells/tissues will also be cultured on these prototype devices to evaluate biocompatibility.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop text, speech and image analysis technologies to transform a set of educational lecture videos into an interactive learning companion. A lecture video will be presented as a series of topically cohesive sections, each represented by a textual summary, a visual summary, and a video segment. Students will be able to query a series of lecture videos with the answers presented as a combination of text, images, speech with transcript, and video, along with links to additional relevant resources. These technological enhancements will drive the development of the lecture video management system with capabilities well beyond commercial state of the art. The students will gain the ability to instantly access any information in a semester long course, with little overhead for the instructor. The business plan focuses on a freemium model designed for wide adoption with no cost to instructors and a very low cost to students. The ultimate potential societal benefit is a significantly better learning experience and learning outcomes for higher education students.


    The key innovations in this project are summarization of video segments and a Questions & Answers (QA) system customized for a series of lecture videos. These are formidable challenges despite existing substantial related research in text mining and image analysis. The information content of a lecture video spans multiple modalities, specifically, screen text, images, and speech. Further, each modality has unique characteristics. Screen text is typically unstructured and includes Optical Character Recognition errors. Transcripts from classroom lecture videos contain informal classroom interactions and suffer from speech recognition errors. The images in a lecture video can represent a variety of concepts including illustrative examples, graphs and charts, and camera images. Innovative approaches to topic modeling will be developed to handle the unique nature of the input compared to most documents. The project will employ representation learning approaches to map from each modality to a common semantic space that will drive the matching between student questions and the content of lecture videos. Since the best answer to a student question may not be fully contained in a lecture video, external resources including textbooks, message boards, and actual quizzes and exams will also be analyzed to drive the QA module.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is that it holds the promise of significantly reducing the over fertilization of crop fields with poultry litter and at the same time provide poultry farmers with greater profits.  Currently poultry litter (excrement, feathers, bedding and other waste) is used as fertilizer on crop fields. The litter is excessively high in phosphorous which is not well adsorbed by crops and ends up in waterways causing excessive algae growth resulting in dead zones with no aquatic life.  This project expects to prove the practicality of a high efficiency burn system that is low enough in cost to be affordable by individual farmers. The system will burn poultry litter and convert the resulting heat energy to electricity and hot water for heating the farmer's chicken houses. The energy savings will increase farmer's net profits (including the amortized cost of the system) by, on average, 25%.  Thus poultry farmers will be incentivized to eliminate environmentally dangerous poultry litter by converting their farm waste to energy.


    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design, produce and test a scaled prototype version of the lab test system.  The lab test system is expected to provide burn efficiencies as high as ~97% with particulate emissions well within EPA standards. The scaled system will be designed to process ten times the litter as the lab system.  The primary question this SBIR project will answer is: can the lab results be replicated in a full scale system capable of handling the requirements of an average poultry farm.  The patent pending technology upon which the lab system was designed uses computer controlled fuel (poultry litter) feed rates coupled with a multilevel air injection system to produce optimal efficiency. There are several variables that will be tested to ensure upscaling the size will be successful. These include combustion chamber size and design, air injection locations, pressures and CFM, and fuel feed rates.  Successful commercialization will require optimization of these variables in a full scale system.

    this vast resource could produce enough food for all of mankind. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase I project proposes to expand previous studies that suggested a novel single
    cell protein (SCP) is a significant candidate to serve as a fishmeal alternative.
    In addition, SCP also may contain functional properties that improve growth performance
    and survival. The SCP tested previously supported improved feed conversion ratios
    (FCR) as compared to conventional diets, while at the same time, statistically
    relevant improvements in survival of carnivorous fish and shrimp.  It also was
    observed that SCP relieved secondary disease complications associated with diets,

    salmon. Targeted components of the SCP will be enhanced (or deleted) to determine
    the effect of leading immuno-nutritional candidates on the animals' ability to
    digest more completely inputs like soy bean meal (SBM). The effectiveness of SCPs
    in emerging commercial fish diets has yet to be fully elucidated, and the results

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to further the development of a patent pending technology aimed at producing flexible, lightweight, and low-cost semiconductor substrates. These flexible semiconductor films represent the next evolution of the silicon wafer, the foundation of over 90% of today's electronic devices, including computer chips, solar panels, microelectronics, and a wide range of sensors and similar 'internet of things' devices. The silicon wafer, in its current form, is essentially unchanged since its inception over 60 years ago. These wafers, although larger today, remain thick, rigid, fragile, and are limited to circular forms no larger than 450 millimeters (18 inches) in diameter. The ability to produce large-area, high-throughput quantities of this material, in a flexible, more durable format would be truly disruptive, and help to usher in the next generation of affordable, flexible, and pervasive electronic devices. Accelerating the commercialization of this 'wafer 2.0' will help to shape America's high-tech semiconductor manufacturing industry for the 21st century.

    The proposed project will focus on the development of this innovative technology at a simulated roll-to-roll prototyping scale, to enhance film crystal quality, repeatability, and electronic properties, while preparing the process for integration into large scale manufacturing. To date, no techniques exist that can produce large-area, highly crystalline silicon or other semiconductor films, that are suitable for high-throughput manufacturing. The technique in this proposed work is a novel, patent pending process, suitable for high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing and has several technical advantages that favor high-uniformity crystallization. Low-cost, flexible, wafer-like substrates will open the door for a wide range of electronic devices and fully integrated system-on-chip designs, including sensors, displays, lighting, processors, memory, microelectronics, and photovoltaics. Specific research activities will include optimization of the crystallization process via exploration of operating parameters; improvements and refinements to the prototype chamber equipment; evaluation of intermediate thin-film layers to provide ideal electronic properties and to promote more favorable recrystallization; and, finally, characterization of the resulting semiconductor films using state of the art semiconductor tools at the world's largest nanotechnology focused institute.

    This Phase I SBIR project will investigate cure-in-place materials for filling and stabilizing open wounds to promote healing. Chronic wounds represent a significant and debilitating burden to patients, affecting more than 6.5 million people in the US alone. The incidence of chronic wounds is expected to rise with increasing rates of obesity and diabetes, but current treatment options show limited clinical efficacy. To address this unmet need, new materials that stimulate the body's healing mechanisms must be developed. This project will evaluate a promising new material that can be applied to a wound as a liquid and cured to a solid in contact with the wound. This cure-in-place process is expected to promote healing by ensuring intimate contact between the pro-healing material and the wound bed, mechanically stabilizing the wound area, and stimulating the body's healing responses. There are few cure-in-place materials in clinical use, so this project will also generate new fundamental engineering knowledge about these materials and their potential applications in human health. The advanced wound care market is currently valued at more than $8 billion, and it is growing. Therefore, innovative technologies in this space represent significant business opportunities that create economic growth.

    This project will investigate a novel cure-in-place process for generating a polysaccharide biomaterial that mimics the mechanical and structural properties of native extracellular matrix to stimulate wound healing. The material is generated by curing two aqueous precursor solutions to form a biodegradable, solid, and hydrated polymer matrix. This project will investigate a cure-in-place process by which the precursor solutions will be applied to the wound as liquids and cured in contact with the wound bed. If the extracellular matrix replacement biomaterial can be cured inside of a wound bed, then its pro-healing effects may be amplified due to its ability to fill an irregularly-shaped wound with complete contact with tissue and its capacity to mechanically stabilize the wound bed and stimulate pro-healing biochemistry. The scope of this effort will include developing an optimized formulation for the cure-in-place precursor solution, determining curing conditions for the biomaterial in contact with tissue, evaluating the material properties of the cure-in-place product, and evaluating cure-in-place application and wound healing efficacy in a porcine excisional wound model.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a 25% cost reduction in solar panel manufacturing
    and the elimination of up to 2.1 Gigatons of annual CO2 generation. As silicon
    wafers are the most expensive component in the $50BN solar panel industry, our
    low-cost wafer manufacturing technology presents the strongest opportunity to
    reduce global solar panel production costs. This cost reduction drives the compelling
    economics needed for increasing solar market penetration. As context, the solar
    market has historically doubled for every 20% cost reduction created by the industry.
    Our single crystal wafers are further significantly higher quality, and therefore
    can enable up to 10% higher effective efficiency using existing commercial solar
    panel manufacturing lines. Further, as the incumbent silicon wafer production
    process is extremely energy- and material-intensive and thus constitutes 80% of
    the solar industry?s carbon footprint, our direct and high efficiency technology
    has the potential to reduce the solar industry's 2026 carbon footprint by over
    50%. \n\nThe proposed project develops the systems needed for our process to produce
    silicon wafers with commercial dimensions and demonstrates to solar manufacturers
    (our customers) that our wafers can be processed by commercial solar cell lines.
    As our process produces a continuous ribbon of silicon, this work will develop
    a cutting system that laser cuts discrete wafers with the edges and dimensions
    needed for commercial solar cell processing. This involves developing the laser
    cutting recipes, the wafer handling systems, and verifying with a third party
    that the edge quality does not interfere with cell processing. Our project then
    investigates and optimizes our wafers' performance during each critical step of
    commercial solar cell processing, including chemical etching and screen printing.
    A successful demonstration that our low-cost wafer can 'drop-in' to an existing
    cell line to deliver equivalent (or better) performance compared to the incumbent
    technology would gate our working with industry partners to commercialize this
    process.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the establishment of the analytical framework and software for a global bathymetry mapping system based upon freely available satellite imagery, three independent extraction methods, and ongoing data collection to create geospatial products for a wide range of applications.? Shallow water zones are crucial to the world?s ecology, economy, and culture.  An estimated 70% of the world?s littoral zone is not mapped to modern standards, and traditional methods of mapping these areas are prohibitively expensive and dangerous. Through remote sensing techniques, this innovation will produce detailed bathymetric data for shallow water areas around the globe at far lower costs than traditional methods. This is particularly significant for impoverished remote, low-lying islands which have scarce resources for mapping the natural environment on which their economies heavily rely. ?Additionally, shallow water bathymetry data is vital to geospatial intelligence and to accurately assessing the feasibility and environmental impact of projects relating to global trade/port development, aquaculture, tourism, and resource development.? The results of this innovation will provide a modern baseline of seabed topography for future scientific analysis, change detection, and greater understanding of the marine environment.

    The proposed project addresses the budgetary and health and safety challenges of nearshore bathymetry mapping by advancing three distinct methods of calculating satellite derived bathymetry. These methods rely on different parameters of measurement for water depth retrieval, enabling the advantages of one method to overcome the shortcomings of another. This will create a self-validating method for leveraging advanced remote sensing algorithms in an integrated software platform with ongoing data collection to produce 10-30m resolution bathymetry elevation models.? Extraction methods utilize underwater stereophotogrammetry from multiple overlapping images, wave kinematic detection from multispectral imagery, and measurement of variable attenuation of multispectral signals through the water column.? Research will be conducted on computer vision applications for assessing and allocating images based upon metocean and atmospheric parameters; seafloor spectral segmentation techniques and effects on subsequent multispectral depth retrieval; automation of stereophotogrammetric seafloor target identification and correlation, and integration and automation of wave kinematic derived depth values with multispectral depth retrieval values.? Statistical analysis of resulting data from this combined processing method, evaluated against in situ data for trial locations, will provide direct comparisons for accuracy reporting, algorithm refinements, computational optimization, and determine overall technical and commercial feasibility of future global implementation.?

However, a more immediate work product from this effort is a powerful fully-digital mmWave software defined radio (SDR) platform that will be made available to academic researchers at very affordable rates; this will spur further research and make mmWave testbed experimentation within the reach of lightly-funded academic research groups. The ambitious goal of making this transformative technology the reference design of future mmWave radios represents a massive commercial opportunity which is not limited to the cellular ecosystem (base station, tablets and smartphones), but rather extends to new connected players such as cars, drones, virtual reality (VR) headsets and beyond.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on the development of millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio technologies for next generation wireless systems. The mmWave frequencies of above 28 GHz are necessary to alleviate the spectrum crunch in the traditional cellular bands, and to make ultra-fast 5th Generation (5G) cellular a reality. However, the uniquely challenging propagation characteristics at these frequencies necessitates the use of transceivers that not only operate over low power budgets, but also deliver the robustness that the cellular ecosystem demands. While existing transceivers allow the radio to look (i.e., transmit or receive) in only one direction or a small number of directions at a time, the proposed transceiver design allows the radio to look in all directions simultaneously. While seemingly simple, this unique ability - combined with a top-down implementation ? will provide enormous benefits to cellular systems at reasonable power budgets. The proposed technology forms the key technological bridge between the theoretical promise of mmWave and actually achieving it in the real world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the practical deployment of a low-cost and low-power real-time perception system in self-driving consumer cars. This edge computing functionality in sensors enables higher reliability and lower cost of overall sensing and computing needed for truly autonomous self-driving. Such innovation will contribute significantly to the early and widespread availability of safety and convenience benefits to consumers. Furthermore, the advanced perception system will have a potential long-term impact on robotics in general, which can lead to creation of new markets and new lifestyles.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop efficient algorithms and software implementation of a real-time perception system to enable the use of low-cost computing systems for self-driving cars. The algorithms provide a novel way of using image features to perform simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with 100 times less computational costs than the existing algorithms. They also include a truly novel neural network to fuse the image feature and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) features and perform object detection, which has 100 times less complexity compared to the state-of-the-art method. These reduced-complexity algorithms can be implemented on low-power and low-cost SoC processors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased range, increased efficiency, and decreased size of wireless charging systems, which will provide value to consumer devices (e.g., mobile phones and tablets), transportation, and medical industries. In consumer devices, improved and widely adopted wireless power transfer can lead to more rugged designs of the devices by eliminating charging ports, which are a common mode of device failure. Widely adopted wireless charging can improve convenience for consumers, and, with a unified charging solution across a number of devices, eliminate the need for dedicated, device-specific chargers. Increased charging range will increase the number of use cases in all three industries, leading to greater commercial opportunities for this this technology and wireless power transfer in general. In transportation, high-efficiency wireless charging allows for fast charging that is adaptable to varying vehicle heights, which makes electric vehicles more convenient, increases their rate of adoption, and allows charging that is integrated into infrastructure. Increased efficiency reduces the energy costs associated with charging across all three industries.  Furthermore, this project will enhance the scientific understanding of the power handling capabilities of the multilayer self-resonant structure, and the resonant frequencies achievable with various manufacturing techniques.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the technical challenges keeping a new wireless power transfer coil technology, called the multilayer self-resonant structure (MSRS), from the market.  In order to commercialize the MSRS, the technology must advance beyond a proof-of-concept, and interface with commercial wireless power transfer systems, specifically those that adhere to existing device standards.  The technical hurdles that need to be addressed include 1) reducing the resonant frequency to meet current standards, 2) understanding the power handling limits, and 3) developing electronic interfaces.  These challenges will be overcome by, respectively,  1) building on existing manufacturing techniques used to handle thin layers of material in other industries and adapting them to  develop a scalable manufacturing approach to construct MSRSs with resonant frequencies in the range needed. 2) Analyzing, measuring, and modeling the power handling capabilities of the MSRS.  Finally, 3) Developing impedance matching circuitry required to interface the MSRS with commercial systems. Successful completion of these task will results in a low cost, high-Q wireless power transfer coil, which can be integrated into commercial systems to increase the capable range, efficiency, and power handling of wireless charging.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the creation of flexible passenger identification displays for ride-hailing and automotive applications. This is a distinct pain point as many drivers choose the same model cars. Our first application is to solve ride-hailing passenger identification, but this becomes more critical with autonomous vehicles -- the only method of visual communication between an autonomous car and its target passenger will be via display. By helping to enable autonomous fleets of service vehicles, our displays will impart significant societal benefits, including reduced emissions, improved mobility for the elderly and disabled, and fewer traffic accidents. Beyond automotive, researchers estimate that in 2017 there are 20 billion devices connected to the Internet that are not computers, growing to 125 billion by 2025. These will influence many areas, including health and wellness, factory production, public safety, retail, agriculture, homes, and offices. They will enable better resource allocation, predictive maintenance, operations management, worker training, task automation, energy management, and safety. Not all of these ?Internet of Things? devices need displays, but those that do use them for input and information relay ? the exact uses for which our displays are designed.

    The proposed project will develop roll-to-roll printed passive matrix OLED (PMOLED) display technology. PMOLED displays are built upon a patterned transparent conductive anode that defines the pixels. To date, the only method used in industry to create this anode is photolithography. This is a slow and expensive batch process, but it is the only method that can produce the required results. Our high-resolution printable anode replaces both the incumbent material and the lithographic process to create a continuous roll of plastic covered in OLED anodes that can be loaded into a printing press. This lays the foundation for fully printed displays, fabricated using flexography, the same technique used to print newspapers. Through this work, we will produce fully printed PMOLED display prototypes. These thin, flexible displays will have extremely high contrast while using only 20% of the power required by a backlit LCD, with wide viewing angles for easy readability and flexibility to conform to any surface. If successful, we will be able to print displays 1000 times faster than the industry standard throughput while reducing materials waste by 80%. Such cost savings will make our displays the obvious choice for information display use, especially in design-driven applications.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is the development of an effective and sustainable alternative
    to antibiotics and biocides used in animal feed, which will help mitigate the
    global health threat of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The beef cattle industry
    is under increasing regulatory and public pressure to reduce or eliminate the
    use of antibiotic feed additives as they are considered a major factor driving
    the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, in-feed antibiotics
    provide significant economic and animal welfare benefits to the cattle industry
    by reducing the incidence and severity of liver abscesses. This project provides
    an alternative for these conflicting concerns by providing a cost-effective alternative
    to in-feed antibiotics. Further, with sufficient understanding of how the rumen
    microbiome impacts animal physiology and performance, this technology could be
    easily adapted to selectively target microbial species that reduce animal growth
    or feed efficiency, or that produce methane, increasing the economic and environmental
    sustainability of livestock agriculture. \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes
    to develop a low-dose, bacteriophage-based feed additive that can be prophylactically
    administered to control the growth of pathogenic Fusobacterium necrophorum in
    cattle rumen. F. necrophorum is a causative agent of liver abscesses in grain-fed
    cattle, and antibiotics are currently added to feed to prevent its growth and
    limit abscess occurrence. However, in-feed antibiotics promote the proliferation
    of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and can cause undesirable off-target effects
    to the rumen microbiome. This research seeks to develop broad host-range (polyvalent)
    bacteriophages as an economical means of controlling cattle pathogens. Polyvalent
    bacteriophages will be isolated using specialized methods that select for those
    with a predetermined host-range based on rumen microbial composition. Each bacteriophage
    will then be characterized and tested for efficacy within a bioreactor operated
    to simulate the cattle rumen. Bacteriophage cocktails will be formulated and tested
    for their ability to minimize the development of bacteriophage resistance. The
    expected outcome of the proposed research is a library of polyvalent bacteriophages
    that can effectively control F. necrophorum under rumen-like conditions, and which
    will be further tested in animal studies.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop single cell analysis technology to provide insight into cellular mechanisms, which has the potential to transform drug development and manufacturing. Single-cell analysis, or the ability to decipher cell-to-cell heterogeneity, is a limiting factor in biotechnology and clinical applications. This project aims to further develop a transformative platform technology for integrated single-cell analysis capable of addressing existing challenges with the current state-of-the-art. The platform will potentially shift the paradigm of drug development and manufacturing, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of new therapeutic compounds. This approach could significantly reduce the time and cost to bring new drugs to market and reduce the overall cost of treating patients, which is a substantial benefit to society. Beyond this initial application, this single-cell analysis platform could become a readily implemented research tool, enhancing our basic understanding of biology, facilitate engineering of cell function, as well as evaluating safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a robust and cost effective commercial prototype technology platform for integrated single-cell analysis. A key feature of the platform technology is the unprecedented sensitivity in measuring quantitatively secreted molecules from single cells. This is achieved by incubating single cells in extremely small volumes, and enabling analytics on an unprecedented scale in these microscopic bioreactors. The proposed work will lead to the development of a consumable prototype microfluidic chip, enabling quick and resource efficient adaptation of the platform to the marketplace. The proposed prototype will be validated through relevant studies, addressing a confirmed market need in cell line development. Commercial adaptation of this prototype will potentially provide deep insight into biological and physiological processes on a single-cell level, and transform drug development and manufacturing, therapeutic treatment, as well as clinical diagnostics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to increase the returns of grain storage for farmers and reduce overall postharvest loss due to toxin and insect damage.  Ten billion bushels, over half of US grains, are stored on-farm each year for 3-12 months.  During this period, grain is susceptible to spoilage, infestation, and moisture loss?all of which impacts the price a farmer receives at the time of market delivery.  There is no easy way to monitor grain quality changes throughout the storage season to optimize for best times to run aeration controls to preserve, condition or maintain the grain.  This leaves farmers with a ?gut check? system of driving to each grain bin site and climbing up and inside units.  Since grain is priced based on moisture baselines, farmers are essentially selling water and weight, their final price outcome can vary significantly based on how well they managed grain conditions throughout the storage period.  In the US, an annual $3 to $ 5 billion dollars (3 ? 5%) of crop value is lost due to toxin, insect and moisture mismanagement that could be prevented through the introduction of affordable and accessible monitoring technology.

    The proposed project would advance internet of things automation and wireless sensor applications as applied to production agriculture and the postharvest supply chain.  There are certain, manual processes of farm production that are strenuous due to time burdens and the lack of obtainable information to make decisions.  Monitoring grain assets, the product of farmers? toil and the safety net of global food supply, in farm bins, commercial storage, and barges is one such process. Sensing for when loss and spoilage risks occur, but more importantly connecting and turning the data into automation opportunities before they exist is the aim of this proposal.  Cable-based monitoring solutions exist, but adoption is restricted due to physical installation limitations, electricity/power constraints, and investment costs.  This project will validate the feasibility of a low-power, wireless sensor that can detect grain conditions and last a full postharvest cycle (18 months).  Such a device will create opportunities to track grain qualities across the agriculture value chain, beginning with its use to monitor and automate farm grain storage.  By characterizing, and testing against cable systems and within grain science 3D models, this project will prove the wireless sensor?s direct functionality within this first farm application.

    This SBIR Phase I project will develop Natural Language Voice-Controlled Lab Assistant technology that enables students to control and interact with hands-on science lab equipment using natural language dialog. The lab assistant technology will connect with science equipment hardware, a mobile or computer app, and cloud-based software for speech recognition and data analysis. A student can perform hands-on experiments, ask questions like "How high did my rocket go?" or "What was the force of the cart collision?", and receive audible responses based on their own experimental measurements. The lab assistant is designed for students that encompass (1) students who are blind or low vision, (2) students with disabilities affecting physical skills, (3) students that would benefit from multi-sensory learning methods as required in Individualized Education Plans (IEPs), and (4) generally students that would benefit from increased engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The broader impacts of the lab assistant technology will be to promote teaching and learning through professional development of K-12 educators in STEM, and enable broad participation of under-represented groups of people in authentic science inquiry.


    The proposed Lab Assistant will be the first application of state-of-the-art voice recognition technology for educational science experiments. The Lab Assistant will integrate with sensor hardware and mobile apps to enable hands-on experiments in physics, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. The intellectual merits of the Lab Assistant are (1) the development of software that can respond to a wide spectrum of natural language questions and (2) the systems integration of many cutting-edge technologies (wireless sensors, mobile apps, voice recognition software, cloud-based data analysis algorithms) into a simple user interface for science education. The voice interactions will help students overcome disabilities with traditional touch and visual technology, work more independently due to the presence of auditory help, work more effectively in groups, and gain confidence in their STEM abilities. For teachers, the Lab Assistant will provide an "expert in the room" to help guide the hands-on activities that they already do, and provide technical support. The Lab Assistant will be especially useful to teachers without formal science training, that nevertheless need to lead hands-on STEM activities.

    Research (SBIR) project is to develop technology to prevent seafood fraud through
    enabling wholesalers, restaurants, and consumers to rapidly identify mislabeled
    fish product outside of controlled laboratory settings. U.S. consumers are subjected
    to mislabeling errors one out of every three times they consume seafood. Species
    that are cheaper and easier to source are commonly swapped for higher value fish
    such as tuna, snapper, and grouper. This substitution occurs at multiple points
    in the supply chain, from producers/processors to wholesalers to restaurants.
    U.S. consumers pay approximately $32 billion for mislabeled seafood on an annual
    basis. Additionally, this seafood may pose a serious health concern or counteract
    regulatory efforts focused on managing vulnerable fish populations and illegal
    fishing. Current seafood identification efforts are insufficient to eradicate
    mislabeling because they require controlled laboratory settings and highly trained
    personnel.  A few portable tests are becoming available but they lack the ability
    to screen large numbers of samples cost-effectively. The platform proposed here
    will enable more widespread seafood identification testing by delivering identification
    within 45 minutes, on-site, and for a lower per sample cost than existing technologies.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to address seafood mislabeling by developing
    a fast and portable DNA-based screening platform to allow for accurate seafood
    identification to address concerns from consumers, retailers, and regulators regarding
    seafood mislabeling.  The key component of the platform to be developed is a nanopore-based
    sensor technology, which is an amplification-free method for direct counting of
    target nucleic acids. It has been demonstrated in preliminary results that the
    technology is able to distinguish grouper DNA from catfish with single-nucleotide
    specificity. This technology also has achieved multiplexed detection, distinguishing
    36 sequences with one sensor. This project will advance this detection assay towards
    a commercial-ready product by expanding the multiplexing strategy to cover 200+
    sequences, designing probes to distinguish 20+ fish species, and then completing
    a full commercial proof-of-principle by identifying seafood species in blinded
    samples in work done on-site.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the ability to sustainably produce more food with fewer water and energy resources. To feed nine billion people on this planet by 2050 we need to develop new systems of agriculture. Indoor agriculture has the potential to transform the way we grow and source our food, enabling locally-sourced crops at higher yields. Food crops can be grown sustainably year-round near all major urban centers if the energy and water consumption of greenhouses could be reduced. This research will lead to the creation of a suite of water management products and services for indoor farming applications thereby making indoor agriculture environmentally sustainable and economically viable.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will commercialize a novel metal organic framework (MOF) material that enables a new class of compact, energy-efficient cooling and dehumidification systems for greenhouses. Recent discoveries at MIT have revealed a novel MOF material with unprecedented water adsorption capacity. Moreover, the MOF material may be readily synthesized from low-cost, bulk commodity chemicals. A dehumidifier operating with this material can harvest waste heat to provide optimal temperature and humidity conditions for controlled environment agriculture. To translate the MOF material from research lab into large scale production, the material must demonstrate sufficient durability under cycling conditions, be designed to afford low cost processing and be integrated into a cost-efficient climate control system that takes advantage of its unique properties. The goal of the proposed R&D is to accelerate durability testing, design a process chemistry to enable low-cost manufacturing and develop system-level models to
    analyze lifecycle performance and cost sensitivity in an indoor farming application.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a preclinical drug characterization platform capable of profiling the effect of a drug candidate on whole protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. PPIs play a pivotal role in most diseases, and are considered high-impact therapeutic targets for cancers, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and more. Over 40 clinically relevant PPIs have been disrupted successfully with small molecules, and several have entered clinical trials. One recently approved cancer drug, Venetoclax, is expected to reach $2.2B in sales by 2020. Despite the enormous clinical and commercial potential of PPI disrupting drugs, preclinical characterization remains a major challenge. Pharmaceutical companies are limited by slow and laborious techniques to measure protein interactions that require each protein to be purified, and each PPI to be measured separately. As a result, only a small subset of relevant interactions are tested during preclinical drug development, which leads to a high incidence of failure during clinical trials. The proposed platform for PPI network characterization is expected to have a major commercial and societal impact by enabling more thorough preclinical screening of PPI inhibiting drugs, reducing the overall cost and time associated with drug development.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a novel platform for screening PPI disrupting drugs that provides quantitative accuracy, enables simultaneous characterization of whole PPI networks, and eliminates the need for protein purification. This platform combines the throughput of a cell-based assay with the accuracy of a bioanalytical technique by linking yeast haploid mating efficiency to the affinity of proteins displayed on the cells' surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that next generation sequencing of diploid cells may be used to accurately measure many PPI strengths simultaneously. The goal of this project is to demonstrate that the proposed platform can correctly recapitulate whole disease-relevant PPI networks and accurately characterize well-studied inhibitors in a format that is compatible with existing high-throughput screening workflows. To demonstrate feasibility, the well-studied BCL2 PPI network, which contains unstable proteins and considerable complexity, will be analyzed to identify each pairwise PPI and compared to known interactions from the literature. The yeast strains and assay parameters will then be optimized for screening water insoluble small molecule drugs and 96-well plate compatibility. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a new platform technology for the preclinical characterization of PPI inhibiting drug candidates.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in improving the quality of general and task lighting and reducing the amount of wasted light, thus reducing energy consumption. Solid state lighting has caused a paradigm shift in the lighting industry. However, the rapid growth of the LED has surpassed our understanding of its effects on human health and productivity, as well as the environment. Developing systems that put light only where it is needed can reduce energy consumption and improve well-being by eliminating glare and wasted light. Full control over where artificial lights shine may also reduce the disruption of natural ecosystems and agriculture caused by light pollution.? Unfortunately, a compact and low-cost solution to spatially controllable illumination is not available. Should one be brought to market, the industry could be tailored to meet the needs of each street lamp, each office worker and the entertainment industry among others. The ubiquitous nature of artificial illumination provides a unique commercial opportunity with multiple market segments for growth potential.

    The proposed project will focus on a microsystems solution to steerable lighting using a low-power, low-cost, silicon-based mirror less than 1 mm in diameter. The mirror is capable of real-time adjustments that will steer incident light with significant angular range. It is controlled using digital electronics and easily combined with traditional smart home electronics. The objective of the research is to measure the optical output of varying system setups and optical components to determine what optics are necessary for proper light output shape, uniformity, and color temperature. The project will rely heavily on a combination of test measurements and simulations to cycle through experiments rapidly and efficiently in order to converge on a manufacturing plan.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide the capability to affordably and reliably connect underserved or unserved Americans to high speed internet using surface-mounted optical fiber, whether they live in a suburban neighborhood or in a remote rural area. The lack of high speed internet access is largely due to an inability to economically distribute broadband communications over the 'last mile' to businesses, homes, schools, and medical or government entities. An understanding of the installed durability of fiber using this technique will usher in new developments to deploy surface-mounted fiber nationwide. More accessible high-speed internet provides more information, opportunity, and economic productivity regardless of the locale. The digital divide between urban and rural Americans could be reduced or eliminated. Lower cost fiber deployments will make it easier to deploy new technologies, like 5G antennas and connected vehicles, and will shrink the cost to make cities smarter with ubiquitous sensors and cameras.

    The proposed project will demonstrate that optical fibers under protective coatings bonded to paved surfaces can provide reliable high speed communications while subjected to weather and traffic. It will allow estimation of the predicted life time of surface mounted fiber on pavement. The testing will place asphalt samples in an environmental test chamber to evaluate competing fiberoptic installations and to identify the best performers for a series of follow-on field and lab tests. This will allow the future targeting of financial resources on the most promising material and profile combinations. Test samples will undergo wide ranging temperature and humidity cycles and repetitive tire impacts under controlled conditions. This testing will identify statistical life predictions in years after only a few months of actual test time. The longer the predicted life, the larger the customer pool, and the wider the potential market penetration. Understanding the predicted lifetime of a fiber installation will open the door to more early adopters, to more pilot program users, and eventually to fiberoptic installers and long term customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project views an IoT firearms detection system in the lens of the military due to their immediate need of such a device and associated data. In addition, a foothold in the military will allow for and influence the adoption in downstream markets such as private security and law enforcement who have already expressed interest in piloting and adopting this technology once fully developed. However, the broader goal and impact of this system more importantly grants the potential to save lives. Whether this system will be used in the military, law enforcement, or private citizens in cases of home and self defense, successful implementation and commercialization of the first firearms detection system will grant the capabilities to objectively monitor and leverage firearm usage data.

    The proposed project aims to research, develop, and commercialize an integrated IoT system dedicated to detecting and processing small arms firearm discharges. The challenge in achieving the goals of this project is two-fold: one to create an IoT system that satisfies the stringent and high standards of the customer and two, to create value within the data collected by these IoT sensors. The proposed research and development covers the creation of a prototype device as well as generating a roadmap based on product and user feedback towards effective use of the data to ensure commercial success.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is the development of yeast fermentation technologies that enable conversion of sugars abundant in pectin-rich agricultural waste into useful specialty chemicals. The U.S. is a leading producer of pectin-rich agricultural wastes including citrus peels (>5 million tons annually), sugar beets (>37 million tons annually), and grape pomace (>1 million tons annually). These peel and pulp byproducts lack value, however, the proposed technologies developed in this project will allow for significantly higher valued products to be produced from these waste streams. The initial target chemical product is used as a chelator in cleaning products and a precursor to plastics. Other chemical products potentially may be produced using this platform. Implementation of this fermentation process offers a lower carbon footprint and emissions compared to petroleum or even other sugar-derived products, and has impact in reducing waste and combating climate change. When implemented at scale, these fermentation processing plants will be co-located with rural agricultural processing plants, adding high-tech jobs in these areas, and offering a means to de-risk historically volatile crop harvests by accessing alternative markets.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to engineer yeast strains capable of converting sugars in pectin-rich agricultural wastes into valuable specialty chemicals. Currently, the fermentation rates for utilizing the primary sugar in pectin, D-galacturonic acid, limits production of these chemicals, including the proposed first product, which is a biodegradable metal chelator. Previous characterization has identified that uptake of the pectin sugars by a transporter as the limiting step. Accordingly, the first objective of this proposal is to characterize this class of transporter to identify new transporters with improved rates. The second objective is to improve the best transporter through protein engineering. Using this improved transporter, the final objective will assess the cellular energy requirements for the fermentation process using bioreactors to control fermenter conditions, as product synthesis and transport is energy-demanding. If successful, this project will enable production of specialty chemicals from pectin-rich agricultural waste.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a drug discovery platform for preclinical cancer drug testing using a 3D tumor model technology. The technology is designed to reduce time and costs associated with the high failure rate (~95%) of cancer drugs by increasing the likelihood that candidate drugs advancing to animal studies will be effective. The robotic technology will provide a biologically relevant tumor model to test libraries of cancer drugs in the preclinical stage, and replace currently used 2D cancer cell models. This project aims to scale up the 3D tumor model technology to accommodate large drug libraries tested in the pharmaceutical industry, and verify that it meets industry standards and customer needs. The technology will expedite the introduction of effective cancer drugs into the market for patient use, and help reduce the more than half a million of lives that cancer claims annually. The proposed work will significantly facilitate the introduction of the technology into the market as a preclinical cancer drug screening tool by demonstrating its competitive advantages and capabilities to improve cancer drug discovery efforts.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and validate a 3D tumor model technology for high-throughput cancer drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry. Despite widespread interest in 3D cancer cell cultures, existing methods are not currently used in the industry due to their many disadvantages. The proposed technology provides a robust, high-throughput, and cost-effective approach to generate 3D cancer cell cultures for rapid drug screening, beyond what is currently available. This work will evaluate quantitatively the reliability and robustness of 3D cancer cell cultures and costs of cancer drug testing while considering competitive techniques. A major goal is to adapt the technology to a 1536-microwell plate format for highly efficient drug screening, which is not currently available on the market, and validate the capabilities of the technology to predict cancer drug responses in animal studies. This work will involve robotic protocol optimization, imaging analysis of 3D cultures for consistency, proof-of-concept cancer drug screening, and statistical evaluation of robustness. It is anticipated that the work will demonstrate the advantageous capacity and speed of the technology for drug testing, industry-level robustness, compatibility with different cancer cell types, ability to predict animal study drug responses, and low cost.

    This SBIR Phase I project aims to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a first-of-its-kind injectable gel for treating osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, a disease of the body's joints, affects greater than 27 million Americans, and the proposed activity will de-risk the proprietary gel technology to warrant continued development of a medical device for treating osteoarthritis. The product is a bioinspired polymer gel solution, to be administered by injection into the joint, which will lubricate, cushion, and protect the joint's cartilage from wear, and thereby slow the progression of osteoarthritis. Upon successful completion of this project, the company aims to complete the preclinical and clinical studies required to gain regulatory approval for the product emanating from the proposed activity. From this project, a deeper fundamental understanding of body-biomaterial interactions will be gained, benefiting engineers, clinicians, and ultimately patients. The anticipated commercial success of this product will result in job creation both before and after completion of product development. As joint pain is one of the leading causes of missed work, disability, and general depreciation of quality of life, successful completion of the proposed high-technical-risk project will lay the foundation for development of an impactful medical device which will treat the highly prevalent disease osteoarthritis.

    The innovation of this project's technology lies in the patented synthetic techniques and composition of a tissue-protective gel solution that remains in the joint capsule at therapeutic concentrations for significantly longer than current injectable gels remain. All injectable viscoelastics approved in the United States for treating osteoarthritis are comprised of hyaluronic acid, a biopolymer which degrades rapidly upon injection; in contrast, the product in this project uses a synthetic, bioinspired polymer which resists degradation and maintains effective viscoelastic properties for four months, whereas current products' viscoelasticity is degraded after one week. The project's first objective will, through a radiolabeled biodistribution study, ascertain the gel's distribution throughout the body following injection into rodent knees, to demonstrate 100% clearance out of the animal and no accumulation within any tissues or organs. The project's second objective will develop the material processing techniques and syringe filling protocol for formulating the gel into its final product form and ensuring product performance and safety specifications are met. Completion of these objectives will allow product to be made under FDA-compliant Design Control for a pivotal large animal study to be conducted following this project, along with completion of formal biocompatibility testing for submission to FDA to seek approval for a First-in-Human clinical trial.

    Research (SBIR) project is the development of a microalgae-based commercial hydrogen
    production process that will surpass current or developing technologies. By 2022,
    the global hydrogen generation market by value is projected to reach $154.7 billion.
    A technology for low-cost, high purity, renewable, scalable hydrogen production
    will accelerate transition to a hydrogen economy, thus facilitating domestic energy
    independence and creating new economic opportunities. Many industries, such as
    the petro-chemical, chemical, and electronics industries, would benefit from low
    cost industrial hydrogen. Transportation and electric power generation industries
    also would benefit from increased fuel efficiency. Environmental benefits include
    replacement of fossil fuels, switching hydrogen production from natural gas to
    sunlight and water, and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. The goal of
    this project is to incorporate proprietary, metabolically engineered, photosynthetic
    algae in combination with recent advances in bioprocessing and hardware engineering
    to manufacture clean, renewable hydrogen. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research
    Phase I project proposes to develop microalgae strains that generate high hydrogen
    yields using a novel metabolic engineering strategy. To pursue this strategy,
    a suitable parental strain must be developed, combining intact hydrogen production
    genes with improved stability of introduced genes (transgenes). Despite the availability
    of genetic transformation methods, transgene stability in wild type strains remains
    poor. This seriously limits development of commercial strains. Two algal UV mutants
    with greatly improved transgene stability are available, but both have impaired
    hydrogen production genes. The proposed investigation will assess the feasibility
    of creating a suitable parental strain. The objectives are: 1) determine differences
    between genes of the best wild type hydrogen producing strain and the UV mutants;
    2) introduce candidate genes into the UV mutants to restore hydrogen production
    metabolism; 3) knock out candidate genes involved in transgene inactivation in
    the wild type strain; and 4) test the ability of the engineered strains to generate
    hydrogen and retain transgenes. This project will produce the desired parental
    strain and enable implementation of the innovative strategy for developing production
    strains with greatly increased hydrogen rates in the target commercial process.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase I project is intended to develop a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive molecular
    detection system for Tuberculosis (TB). Although the prevalence of TB has diminished, it still
    remains the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease. The latest global TB report
    from the World Health Organization with data compiled from 205 countries put the figures at 1.5
    million fatalities and 9.6 million infections annually. The proposed technology uses the nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) properties to enhance the detection signal of the TB biomarker by
    more than 100X. This results in detecting concentrations in femto-gram/milliliter range resulting
    in early detection and treatment. The specificity, faster results, low cost/test and ease of use,
    makes this system a substantive innovation in the TB diagnostic market. The TB testing market
    accounts for $1.5 billion annually of which North America is the second largest in terms of
    generated revenue due to the higher pricing for TB detection. The proposed technology will
    benefit the patients with early diagnosis and provide the health care professionals with early
    treatment options. With all the advantages this technology has to offer, it is expected to gain a
    significant share in the market place and generate a revenue stream.

    The main limitation of the immunoassays is their inability to detect extremely small fluorescence
    signals that are associated with ultra-low concentrations of biomarkers. The proposed nano-
    Plasmonic Grating (P-GRAT) technology can overcome this limitation due to its exceptionally
    efficient light coupling, reduced scattering, high signal-to-noise ratio and directional
    excitation/emission. As a result, a fluorescence enhancement of P-GRAT is 100X or higher
    compared to a glass substrates or polyurethane well plates. Such enhancements translate to ultrasensitive
    detection and early diagnosis. Commercial immunoassays require hours to days to
    achieve pg/ml sensitivity. In comparison, P-GRAT can detect pg/mL range concentrations in less
    than three hours. P-GRAT utilizes a simplified design to exclude expensive optics like laser
    sources, high-magnification objective lenses and filter cubes. The use of 3-D printed parts to
    fabricate the system and use a smartphone as the detector further reduces the cost. We intend to
    develop and commercialize a noninvasive, ultra-sensitive (fg/ml) molecular detection system for
    Tuberculosis (TB). TB specific biomarkers Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and Interferon gamma
    (IFN-g) will be detected in urine and saliva. P-GRAT is a platform technology and can easily be
    adapted for the ultra-sensitive detection and diagnosis of other diseases, such as Zika, Ebola,
    HIV and Cancer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop protein purification technology that will provide access to inexpensive, purified proteins for biological and life science applications by removing the purification bottleneck in biopharmaceutical production, and leveraging the innovative breakthroughs in protein engineering and gene editing.  Scale-up of this technology will transform the large-scale purification of biopharmaceuticals and lower prescription drug costs - the most important factor contributing to rising healthcare costs.  The major factor influencing the rising cost of healthcare is the skyrocketing costs of pharmaceuticals - up to 40% of the medical plan cost will be drugs by 2025.  Prescription drug costs are the fastest rising component of healthcare and are contributing to the dramatic increase in healthcare costs.  The worldwide focus of pharmacy and biotechnology is now on biopharmaceutical development and production to address this issue.  Direct benefits of this project include low-cost, use of green reagents, and the absence of heavy metal impurities in the purified protein.  In addition, the development of immobilized enzymes using this technology will open new frontiers in biocatalysis, biosensors, diagnostics and protein delivery.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop protein purification kits for small-scale and research-scale research. Bringing these kits to market will enable researchers to further validate the technology on a broader range of proteins in preparation for scale-up for biopharmaceutical production.  Synthetic biology has quickly begun to revolutionize drug discovery and design by providing a better overall molecular understanding of disease.  However, this potential has yet to be fully realized due to the challenges associated with purifying the target recombinant protein from the thousands of naturally-occurring proteins produced by the expression system.  The three specific aims of the project are: 1) validation of protein tag performance for multiple protein classes and expression systems, 2) development of low-cost methods for protein tag removal from purified proteins, and 3) development of solutions for the purification of low-expressing proteins and the parallel purification of small amounts of proteins.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to enable electrification of remote oil & gas processes to reduce methane emissions, improve on-site safety, and provide leak-detection and monitoring capabilities. This will be achieved by developing a robust, efficient, small-scale power generator capable of converting on-site fuel to electricity. Beyond the entry opportunity in the oil & gas sector, this technology has other applications in large markets such as residential and commercial power generation and heating, transportation, and military. For example, our proposed generators would allow consumers in moderate/cold climates to efficiently match their time-dependent heating and electrical demands using natural gas (accessible to 70 million households). For a typical household in those regions, we estimate a 45% reduction in primary energy use and CO2 emissions by deploying our generators. The energy reduction translates to an annual savings of about $650 per household. Widespread deployment of our technology would grow the domestic natural gas economy, strengthen the US technological lead in semiconductor manufacturing, and facilitate renewables by providing a dispatchable supply.?

    The proposed project will investigate the fundamental heat-to-electric conversion process and address key issues around the stability and robustness of the technology, through a synergistic effort to develop generators capable of high performance and a manufacturing process to reduce cost. The project will focus on device optimization and durability, and process repeatability. This involves the fabrication and integration of multiple frequency-selective components including a thermal emitter, optical filter, photovoltaic cell, and back surface reflector. Each component, as well as the integrated system, will undergo rigorous thermal testing to prove both resistance to elevated temperatures and temperature swings. Additionally, novel manufacturing techniques will be developed to enable cost-competitive devices relative to conventional generators. If the technical objectives are met, this project will demonstrate record-breaking performance for thermophotovoltaics and accelerate the commercialization of thermophotovoltaic devices in many different markets.?

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer(STTR) project is to develop a bio-based manufacturing process for glucaric acid and its intermediate, glucuronic acid. Microbial fermentation represents an attractive option for production of fuels and valuable chemicals from renewable resources, and glucaric acid can be produced from glucose, a renewable biomass-derived resource.  The glucaric acid market was estimated at $550M in 2016, and has a plethora of uses ranging from detergents to food ingredients, corrosion inhibitors, and de-icing applications.  The proposed project will engineer improved productivity of the microbe using C5/C6 sugars, thus accelerating the production of low-cost, high-purity glucaric acid. Achieving these bioprocess improvements will facilitate widespread adoption of bio-based glucaric acid in a variety of markets, broadening opportunity for US products. These applications include coatings, foams and foaming aids, electrolytes, gels, polymers, and polymer additives.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to perform multi-omics studies to characterize the physiology of E. coli strains producing glucaric acid via fermentation, and develop strain engineering strategies to enable high yield and productivity. Most fermentation products are highly reduced compared to the starting sugar, and care must be taken to maintain cells in a reduced state, meaning high NADH/NAD ratio, to drive the NADH-consuming biosynthetic reactions. Products that are derived from sugar oxidation, in contrast, pose a much different challenge, and have been explored to a much lesser extent. Here, additional oxygen is needed to accept the excess electrons generated during glucose oxidation. It is well known that both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, two of the most common organisms for industrial application, are limited in their electron transport chain capacity, resulting in overflow products from high glucose uptake rates. Regardless of the oxygen transfer ability of the fermentation equipment, there is an inherent maximum production rate of these organisms. In this project, the plan is to develop E. coli strains with increased respiration capacity, thus increasing the maximum glucose oxidation rate. Glucaric acid, which can be produced from glucose via 3 enzymatic reaction steps, is an exemplary product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel materials processing technology that progresses the state-of-the-art of carbon fiber composites while leveraging mature and cost-efficient manufacturing methods. The processing technology of interest produces a material that approaches the isotropic properties of high-performance metal alloys while retaining the light-weight and stiffness of carbon fiber composites. Components that are fabricated from this new composite will have higher impact strength and reduced susceptibility to delamination, compared to commercially-available carbon fiber composites. The broader impact of this project includes providing engineers with a new tool to implement previously unfeasible designs that drastically improve performance while reducing energy consumption and material waste. The rapid adoption of carbon fiber composites in the wind energy, aerospace, and defense industries provides an opportunity for the novel material developed in this project to disrupt the $25-billion global carbon fiber composite market. Effective scale-up to industrial production of the novel carbon fiber composite can revitalize the Massachusetts textiles manufacturing ecosystem and increase the competitiveness of the U.S. advanced materials manufacturing base.

    The intellectual merit of this project is the continuous production of a three-dimensionally (3-D) reinforced carbon fiber prepreg that features a carbon fiber fabric reinforced with vertically aligned short carbon fibers. This novel material provides a laminated composite part with dense through-thickness and interlaminar reinforcement. Conventional carbon fiber laminates lack through-thickness reinforcement and rely on an unfilled polymer matrix to bind the layers of the laminate together, resulting in poor impact performance and frequent delamination. This project involves the roll-to-roll fabrication of 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs and characterization of the produced composite material. The anticipated result of the project is the repeatable fabrication of a 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepreg with enhanced performance compared to commercially-available prepregs. Successful completion of this project will enable further scale-up of the associated manufacturing technology and the commercial-launch of novel 3-D reinforced carbon fiber prepregs to produce stronger, lighter, and more durable composite structures.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    a cost-effective and scalable direct recycling method for producing battery-grade
    cathode materials from end-of-life (EOL) lithium-ion batteries. The commercialization
    of the proposed direct lithium-ion battery recycling technology will lower the
    energy consumption and emissions associated with battery production, reduce demand
    for raw battery materials and decrease lithium-ion battery manufacturing cost.
    Using directly recycled materials instead of raw battery materials will diminish
    or even avoid the negative environmental impacts from mining and processing ores
    and from disposal of hazardous waste. Reducing battery cost will facilitate the
    implementation of more efficient electrified vehicles, thus reducing petroleum
    demand and vehicle emissions. Finally, research on the end-of-life lithium-ion
    battery cathode, on the direct recycling process and on the recycled materials
    will advance the understanding of intercalation chemistry in nonaqueous and aqueous
    media and of electrode degradation during electrochemical cycling. \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is to advance the direct recycling technology through the
    design and demonstration of a scalable electrochemical flow system capable of
    non-destructive relithiation and the optimization of post treatment operation
    for the recovered materials. The electrochemical flow system is capable of restoring
    the lost lithium in the EOL cathode material at any state of charge (SOC) and
    can be scaled to a commercially viable size. The cathode materials recovered in
    the proposed direct recycling process retain the same structure and morphology
    and exhibit equivalent electrochemical performance compared to the commercial
    virgin cathode materials. The recovery of high-value cathode materials substantially
    improves the profitability of lithium-ion battery recycling and is a key element
    of the business plan.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    finding a practical and cost-effective protective cap for baseball pitchers susceptible
    to serious head injuries from impacts of batted baseballs. The new cap design
    satisfactorily addresses the shortcomings of previous commercialization efforts
    that were unable to meet the prescribed protective requirements; failed to pass
    both the players' fashion expectations and comfort evaluation; and carried a hefty
    purchase price. The acceptance and use of the new cap by professional baseball
    players will create widespread demand from collegiate, high school and Little
    League players, a market that is estimated to generate annual revenues of more
    than $18M. These market projections exclude consideration of the technology's
    Broader Impact potential in other sports or vocational and military applications,
    where there is a growing recognition of the need for improved head protection
    for athletes, soldiers, law enforcement officials and construction workers. Sports
    injuries are now highly scrutinized, especially those causing long-term medical
    issues from brain injury, blunt force trauma and repetitive concussive injury.
    The societal value of this innovation will be found in safer sports and work environments.
    Such equipment represents a rapidly growing segment of the apparel market and
    a unique commercial opportunity for the company. \n\nThe intellectual merit of
    this project is based on the company's patented design that provides head protection
    from the impact of a baseball. The novelty of the protective cap headliner is
    its flexible outer hard shell made with highly rigid interconnecting truncated
    icosahedron panels. This allows the headliner to conform to the shape of the head
    while maintaining the stiffness needed to diffuse impact loads.  Since the impact
    of a baseball represents a short duration point load, the energy-absorbing capacity
    of the layer beneath the outer shell can be minimized. The objective is to identify
    the material characteristics required to dissipate the impact load associated
    with a Severity Index of 1200 or greater when a head-form is struck by a baseball
    traveling at speeds up to 125 mph; and to identify the material combination(s)
    best suited to achieve this goal. Traditional foam materials as well as state-of-the-art
    material compositions will be used in unique configurations to produce solutions
    that are not too heavy, not too bulky nor too hot to wear. The outcomes of this
    study will determine the availability of materials that can be used within the
    ergonomic and mechanical constraints of the patented design to protect the head.\n\nThis

    fast focusing and zoom in microscopy with an optomechanical system consisting
    of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) mirrors. The microscope add-on will
    enable fast 3D imaging in wide-field microscopes and increase focusing and zoom
    speeds by 100x when compared with conventional methods in confocal and multiphoton
    microscopy. The technology allows the sample stage and objective lens turret to
    remain stationary during experiments. It will increase throughput, preserve sensitive
    samples, enable observation of dynamic events, and reduce training time. The innovation
    will spur significant discovery in understanding dynamic reactions that occur
    in in vivo and in vitro microscopy. The initial target market has an estimated
    gross revenue of $75M. The technology also promises to benefit 3D imaging systems
    for manufacturing or machine vision, optical coherence tomography, and endoscopic
    imaging systems by providing high speed and agile focus control. While MEMS are
    ubiquitous in mobile platforms and the automotive industry for motion sensing,
    they have not yet permeated other markets or imaging systems to the same extent.
    With recent advances in fabrication and performance of optical MEMS devices, bringing
    this type of technology to other platforms can spark greater commercialization
    of the technology in non-traditional areas. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this
    project is foremost the demonstration of a novel optomechanical system with MEMS
    mirrors for independent control of focusing and zoom in microscopy. MEMS mirrors
    are a type of varifocus element. They remain stationary while their voltage-controlled,
    configurable surface shapes allow for fast focusing and attendant correction of
    spherical aberration. Fast MEMS mirrors, with sufficient diameters for 2x zoom
    and significant focusing capability, have not previously been demonstrated in
    literature or commercially. By producing and characterizing fast, large-diameter
    MEMS mirrors for this project, knowledge of varifocus elements will be advanced.
    This project will also continue to define standard optical design practices to
    best utilize varifocus elements, since traditional optical analyses assume fixed
    focal length lenses or mirrors. The project objectives are three-fold: 1) fabricate
    large-diameter MEMS mirrors with greater than 40% yield, 2) characterize their
    focusing range and dynamic behavior, and 3) demonstrate them in a focus and zoom
    system suitable as a microscopy add-on component.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to significantly increase the efficiency and reduce operating costs for water produced by membrane-based desalination.  Water scarcity is an increasingly important global-scale issue that has significant negative impacts on health, security and economies.  Recent forecasts show a dramatic increase in the number of countries that will soon be affected by water scarcity given that global water consumption is expected to significantly increase due to population growth.  Membrane-based water desalination, which at large scale requires a huge capital investment, is recognized as a primary technology that can significantly improve supply to meaningfully offset scarcity and its impacts.  A critical factor in desalination plant operations is energy consumption, which increases due to membrane fouling, thus making fouling one of the most significant factors controlling the efficiency of these plants.  The proposed in-situ, real-time sensing system can be the enabling technology to allow implementation of advanced plant control algorithms based upon accurate detection of fouling at its earliest stages.  Such active detection capability will enable the most effective implementation of fouling mitigation strategies that can be optimized to save energy and reduce cost.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel time-reversal waveguide sensor for detection of early-stage (ES) fouling in reverse osmosis (RO) membrane desalination, which is the dominant technology for desalinating brackish water and seawater.  Fouling in RO systems has inorganic (scaling) and organic (biofouling) components and can be a highly variable process that depends on operational parameters as well as environmental conditions.  Efficient implementation of real-time control of RO desalination for fouling mitigation requires real-time sensing.  The overall objective of the proposed work is to develop sophisticated ultrasonic sensor technology that can reliably detect scaling and biofouling in the challenging multi-layer, spiral-wound (SW) geometry of commercial-scale RO systems.  The proposed work will make use of time-reversal mirrors to produce a simple signal from a multi-mode waveguide independent of the geometry of the waveguide configuration, thus overcoming the exceedingly complex and difficult to interpret signals associated with the use of a standalone waveguide.  The goals of the project are to demonstrate the capability to detect both early-stage inorganic and organic fouling under realistic operating conditions, the reliability and the robustness of the technology, and the ability to adapt the technology to the larger size modules that are increasingly important for commercial operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop smart software to plan and control Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure in commercial facilities, such as workplaces, hotels, car rental centers, parking garages, etc. The EV planning software finds the optimal design balancing design tradeoffs such as EV customer satisfaction, grid stability limits and financial constraints. This software will help facility operators to optimize their EV charging infrastructure by minimizing their operating costs and maximizing their revenue by utilizing intelligent scheduling and pricing strategies. The software leverages the latest developments in stochastic optimization for designing an optimal configuration of EV infrastructure that is robust to variations in mobility behavior of the users. This will enable public utilities to save billions of dollars by deferring expensive upgrades to their existing infrastructure. It will also empower small consulting businesses, facility managers and electrical contractors to design and build EV infrastructure without any specialized knowledge of optimization or modeling.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the problem of planning and controlling EV charging infrastructure to meet the rapidly growing energy demands of EV owners. EVs are expected to comprise 30% of all cars globally by 2030. This forecasted increase over the next 10 years is of major concern for utilities, and commercial real estate owners. Given the long commute distances, driving habits, time taken to charge using home-based chargers and range anxiety, there is a need for charging locations at workplaces, hotels, and car rental centers. Chargers at these locations will generally be medium power Level 2 chargers, which are 5 to 10 times the size of typical home chargers. Simultaneous uncontrolled charging of several EVs at these locations will easily overload the local electrical infrastructure. The software mitigates this problem by designing an optimal EV infrastructure together with optimally sized onsite generation and storage. The controlling solution ensures that the grid impacts are minimized by scheduling the installed EV chargers together with onsite generation and storage with optimal set points in real time.

    Art, and Mathematics (STEAM). Global expanding markets for DJ gear, a $1.587B
    dollar growth industry, over the past 3 years grew in sales by 21%. As technology
    and entertainment converge, DJs represent the new \"Superstar\" for today's youth.
    Thus, this research represents an incentivizing gateway for students to learn
    how math, engineering and science intellectual assets can contribute to musical
    and artistic innovation. Additionally, middle and/or junior high school students'
    analysis of the data derived from a performance and entertainment-related technology
    can be an incentivizing and engaging entrance into STEM academic subjects such
    as systems design, acoustics, and computer coding.  Given the DJ tool's relation
    to these topics as well as music's inherent link with physics and math, its integration
    into the curriculum of after-school programming options are expected to foster
    more interdisciplinary STEM learning. Afterschool turntable academies as thematic
    contexts for STEM learning function as supportive and assistive educational venues.
    Collectively, the broader impact of this project should produce economic competitiveness
    in the music/technology industry for the U.S. overall and, specifically for youth,
    enhanced engagement in STEM fields.\n \nThe intellectual merit of this project
    stems from the necessity for individuals to seamlessly interface with the digital
    world without losing creativity, artistry or individuality. The technical innovation
    emerges from determining the coordinate location of an analog audio occurrence,
    tracking the change in occurrences, and matching it to a digital counterpart to
    follow the changes created. The sensor data points are utilized to metamorphose
    the turntable, the musical instrument of the DJ, into a complete analog/digital
    educational tool. This technology can offer critical insights to STEM learning
    and educational opportunities to students who may feel that STEM concepts or careers
    are separate from their personal interests and cultural context. Anticipated outcomes
    include advancements in the arts, sciences and education by contributing to entertainment's
    most recent and broadly recognized musical instrument and making it more available
    in middle and high school STEM educational curricula and after school activities.
    The proposed research intends to investigate, identify and resolve current liabilities
    connected with the transient acoustic degradation, deleterious latency introduction,
    and physical performance loss by systems intended to mimic the analog turntable.
    The research objective will be to create novel interface models to analyze the
    elements captured from the DJ musician and translate these into a commercially
    and educationally viable platform."

    at the vanguard of scientific discovery, in building a technology tool that will
    serve society?s goals. In the post-secondary education and training domains, market
    inefficiencies require excess spending on both sides of the transaction, adversely

    and data scientists, game designers, and software engineers, are creating video
    games that provide insights into a college applicant's career potential. Their
    platform captures massive amounts of micro-behavioral data -- how long players
    hesitate before making a move, persistence in the face of challenge or frustration,
    ability to parallel process -- to create a psychographic profile of the player's
    career-critical characteristics, including traits like competitiveness, extroversion,
    risk tolerance, and other enduring, personal traits difficult to discern through
    resumes and traditional, college application materials. Once a student's career
    objectives become clear, the company's proprietary recommendation engine suggests
    educational institutions and curricula best suited to attain the player?s career
    goals. In addition to expanding the game platform and collecting player data to
    develop and fine tune predictive algorithms, this project also will examine factors

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project include enabling the minimally invasive treatment of a large variety of conditions. This is expected to be achieved through the development of a steerable needle that can reach arbitrary positions in the human body that are not reachable by a straight needle from a simple needle hole. The long term impact of the proposed technology is in targeted delivery of medicine, or the removal of tissue such as biopsies, or treatment mechanisms such as ablation devices. An overarching goal of the proposed project is the availability of minimally invasive procedures that can replace more drastic surgery options. The development of this device has the potential to also save lives, treating what otherwise would be inoperable conditions due to the location of tumors blocked by sensitive organs or bones.


    The proposed project, if successful, will lead to demonstrating the application of a device that utilizes the buckling behavior of semi-curved beams to controllably alter the stiffness in a needle for cancer treatment and measure its efficacy in terms of the advantages over straight needles. The objectives of this research include: developing a prototype and match to surgeon use cases (interventional radiologist) and testing and characterizing the steerability performance while delivering the medical payload. Specifically, it is expected that the first therapeutic application of this technology will be microwave ablation of cancer tumors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in enabling additional energy savings in buildings by harvesting natural daylight and using it for illuminating the interior space with high efficiency and without glare, thus offsetting the need for electrical lighting. This will make building operations more sustainable and help improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, when commercially available, this new technology will bring all of the well-known benefits of enhanced natural lighting for occupants of millions of residential and commercial buildings across the U.S., such as connection to outdoors and improved comfort, productivity and well-being, thus benefiting many groups of consumers.

    The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel, non-prismatic optical film material and its use for enhanced daylighting harvesting in buildings. This material employs thousands of microscopic reflective surfaces embedded into the bulk of the material and operates by capturing the incident sunlight and projecting it deep into the building interior. Commercial buildings alone consume about 20 percent of all energy used in the United States at an estimated cost of nearly $180 billion. Building interior lighting accounts for around 30% of that cost. By applying the daylight-harvesting optical material to windows of building facades, a significant fraction of that energy consumption can be offset using the natural light captured throughout the day. The project will provide the critical design, testing, and experimental validation needed to transition the technology into the commercial sector. The primary objective of the project is to develop the core light-redirecting material and associated micro-optical fabrication technology that can be subsequently scaled for low-cost mass production. A second objective is to develop, test and demonstrate a prototype daylight-harvesting window film product based on this material.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the first time commercial development of a copper cable which can transmit and store energy. Currently, copper cables are used for transmitting electricity. Adding energy storage capability to these cables is transformative and has the potential to be employed in a myriad of electrical and electronic applications. Making these cables into spools of wires and custom sliced into a certain length to achieve a required capacitance will be very attractive to commercial applications. The proposed study enables to understand how energy transmission and storage can be simultaneously performed without mutual interference. These cables can find niche applications in the automotive, energy, defense, and IT industries. Moreover, when made into thin wires, it can be weaved into a matrix which can be used to charge wearable devices. For example, currently, a soldier carries about 30-40 pounds of battery for a three-day mission. However, if energy storage devices like the one proposed here can be made into an advanced textile form and can be worn as a uniform, the weight currently carried by the soldiers can be considerably reduced. A cable energy storage device developed can also be beneficial for storing energy for clean-energy technologies such as wind and solar.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project fills the gap of a cable-type capacitor which saves space and fits well with electrical and electronic devices. The objective of this proposal is to use nanotechnology-based fabrication techniques to grow nanowhiskers with a high surface area on a copper cable to make cable-type capacitors. These nanostructures considerably enhance the surface area necessary for the storage of electrical charges. Since nanostructures are developed only on the outside of the electrical cable to store energy, the inner part of the cable can still be used for electrical transmission. The focus of the proposed research is to develop the processes which can be used to make these nanostructured electrodes into a cable capacitor. The fabrication techniques for growing nanostructures will be so designed that making long lengths of the cables are feasible. The performance of the cable-based capacitors will be tested in terms of capacitance, cycle life, voltage output, etc. In addition, the flexibility of the cable will be tested at different bend-angles to evaluate its applications in flexible energy storage applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will enable the automated harvesting of fragile produce such as strawberries to help offset a shrinking workforce and increased labor costs. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 billion to 11.2 billion by 2100, this population growth and a rising middle class will place more demand on the agricultural industry. Presently, the agricultural industry relies solely on manual labor to harvest its fragile produce. There is no mechanized option that can reliably and cost effectively harvest these crops. Consequently, the industry is struggling to harvest its crop, maintain quality and control its costs. High quality and lower costs can only be maintained if robotic harvesters are utilized that can pick fragile produce without damage. One of the key elements on the automated harvester is a gripper that can grab and pick the produce without damage. There is a market for a reliable and low cost robotic gripper that can gently pick and handle strawberries and other fragile produce.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the development of a robotic end effector that can be used to harvest and handle fragile produce. Advances in machine vision and robotics has made it possible to commercially harvest fragile produce such as strawberries, however, the key component that still needs to be developed is an end effector that can pick the fruit without damage and be reliable and cost effective. Design and development of this end effector will use a new and novel method for grabbing the strawberry with advances in design, materials and actuation. The proposed R&D plan will involve repeated testing of the interaction between the fruit and the end effector. Analytical studies using a series of thin film load sensors mounted on the end effector will provide real time load profiles that can be used to optimize the design and performance of the end effector. Shelf life testing of the fruit will be used to assess the success of the end effector in properly picking and handling the fruit without damage.

    This SBIR Phase I project will study the development of a digitally configurable shape around which a shoe can be created. The results of this project will enable the mass-customization of shoes so they can precisely fit the feet of the individuals who wear them. Properly fitting shoes are intended to improve the quality of life of customers through reduced pain and improved musculoskeletal health. This development in shoe-making technology is of broad interest to the population of the United States, but particularly important to women, who often suffer from physical deformities and injuries caused by ill-fitting shoes. The proposed innovation relies on mass-customization methods and flexible robotics technology. Its anticipated success will provide additional jobs in the shoe industry and related fields, and improve productivity nationwide through reduced healthcare costs.


    The strong technical innovation in this project will be the adaptation of granular jamming technology for use in programmable shape technology. The driving goal of the proposed project is to develop a last for use in the mass-customization of shoes that is capable of changing shape in response to a digital representation of the customer's foot shape. After changing shape, it will lock into a rigid but smooth form appropriate for use in traditional shoe manufacturing methods. The scope of the research will cover the development of the last in a manner appropriate for use in manufacturing conditions (in terms of both physical and temperature durability) and the creation and implementation of algorithms for transforming foot shape data into an appropriately fitting shoe shape and for transforming a standard shoe pattern onto an arbitrary foot shape. Iterative design practices and just-in-time manufacturing techniques will facilitate the development of this new technology and manufacturing methodology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by developing computing solutions for precision medicine.  Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) now produces a large amount of genome data at an affordable cost. Analyzing large volumes of genome data from diverse populations will lead to a better understanding of the causes of various diseases ranging from cancer to rare genetic disorders, and develop better cures. By sequencing a patient's genome, it is possible to more specifically determine his/her condition and devise an individualized treatment plan. And, if every newborn's genome was sequenced, it would allow for proactive identification of disease risks, and early intervention. Understanding viruses and bacteria will help us gain a better understanding of infectious diseases, and thereby enable us to develop better immunization and disease control methods. In addition to health-care, genomics also may help engineer better food crops and attain food security.  This project will develop novel computing hardware solutions that are customized for genomics sequencing software. These computing solutions can help realize an exponential growth in the digital genomics market and bring affordable personalized medicine to all.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to accelerate Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) by building a customized processor for genomics automata.  Over the last decade, the production cost of sequencing has plummeted from ten million dollars to a thousand dollars, and is soon expected to go below a hundred dollars per genome. Advancements in processor performance, however, have not kept pace. It can take several days on a computing cluster to sequence a genome. For genome sequencing to become as affordable as a routine medical test, computing solutions are required that can sequence a genome in minutes, and cost only a few dollars per genome. This project is developing a novel ASIC hardware accelerator for computing finite state automata, which supports approximate string matching, a computational kernel widely used in genomics applications such as sequencing. The design is based on a novel in-memory hardware technology for efficiently implementing state transitions. The goal is the improve efficiency of genomics automata by two orders of magnitude compared to modern processors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes a new, low-cost approach to 3D millimeter wave image sensors enabling non-destructive evaluation in construction, as well as other fields such as robotics, security, and quality control. Millimeter wave imaging uses human-safe, radio frequency signals to make high resolution images of objects that cannot be seen with conventional optical sensors. Because of their long wavelength, millimeter waves pass through many materials that are opaque to visible light, including common construction materials such as drywall, brick, tile, cement, and wood. For example, in the construction market, dramatic cost savings and faster, safer, and more accurate construction work could be achieved using millimeter wave imaging for structural evaluation as well as observing hidden utilities such as wiring and plumbing that should be avoided while drilling, and detecting hazards such as water leaks behind wall surfaces. This project will also provide entrepreneurial opportunity to a new generation of scholars/innovators as the technology matures toward commercial practice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to advance the state of the art in millimeter wave imaging and enable low-cost, standalone 3D millimeter wave imagers. Prior work in a laboratory environment has demonstrated the promise of millimeter wave imaging for applications such as structural analysis in construction, however commercialization requires an image sensor that is fast, portable, low power, and low cost. This project will enable low cost hardware/software platforms for millimeter wave imaging using commercial chipsets with novel general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU)-accelerated image reconstruction algorithms.

    This SBIR Phase I project develops chemical tools and platforms to produce valuable chemical building blocks that can be used to produce synthetically challenging compounds on large scales. These compounds belong to the class of polypropionates which is known for its diverse and powerful biological activities across multiple indications within the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and veterinary industries. The high impact of the polypropionate class is hampered by the inefficiencies of current chemical processes to fully tackle their complex structures. Importantly, the lack of scalability adds another severe complication to the development process. To fully unlock the potential of this class, improved chemistries with greater efficiencies are required to successfully identify high impact candidates for further development. Moreover, the new tools are excellent substrates for polyketide?{enhanced drug discovery. This project is a prelude to the development of a novel class of compounds against rare and unmet needs in cancer in collaboration with the NCI/NIH. Such cancers pose a huge burden on the healthcare system and the economy in general. Inspired by the NSF mission, this project describes an innovative chemical process that can deliver highly valuable compounds. Such an approach will enable accelerated discoveries across multiple medicinal and agrochemical needs.

    This project aims to provide all sixteen possible stereotetrad building blocks (in the form of chiral lactones) for construction of polypropionates on practical scales. Those chiral building blocks can serve as common precursors for synthesis of polypropionates, as tools for rational design and structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, or as entries for more diverse and complex library of analogs. The chemistry platform used to produce those building blocks is referred to as the Chiral Carbon Catalog (CCC). The CCC platform is a synthetic tool box that allows stereoselective large scale economic synthesis of various complex polypropionate building blocks from simple starting materials. The unified process has been carefully designed to employ highly diastereoselective substrate directed transformations while avoiding expensive and impractical chiral auxiliary overheads or expensive catalysts. The high efficiencies of transformations allow the elimination of tedious and expensive purifications such as column chromatography. The crystalline natures of key intermediates enable facile production on scale and allow the synthetic routes used by the platform to be easily adopted by the industry for large scale production. This ensures adequate supply of those building blocks for development of complex chiral products within several industries (e.g. pharmaceutical and agrochemical fields).

    and replace problematic sunscreen ingredients in current use. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    I project proposes to develop a sustainable means of producing a natural, marine-based
    sunscreen ingredient for skincare applications. This project focuses on increasing
    yields and recovery of gadusol, a fish-derived UV-B-absorbing sunscreen, by using
    the tools of microbial fermentation and synthetic biology. The gadusol biosynthetic
    pathway was recently introduced into yeast.  The key technical objectives of his
    project are to improve gadusol yields, evaluate yeast-produced gadusol use in
    skin care products, and develop methods for purification that will be applicable
    to large-scale production.  The anticipated outcome of this project is a new and
    underutilized sunscreen compound derived from natural sources that has the potential
    to provide UV protection without the health and environmental risks associated
    with current commercial ingredients."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to develop a new class of cancer therapeutics that involves the re-directing of the body's pre-existing immune response obtained through previous childhood vaccination to target tumor cells for cancer eradication. Globally, cancer continues to be a top 5 leading cause of death resulting in a high unmet need for novel therapies and treatments. Immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs have emerged as a potent solution with demonstrated clinical benefits. However, such treatments are expensive and toxic, and up to 70% of cancer patients do not respond to such drugs due to the absence of an anti-tumor response. In contrast, the proposed strategy tailors the patient's tumor to become susceptible towards their own pre-existing childhood vaccine immunity. This approach will change treatment outcomes for many cancer patients previously un-targetable by current immuno-therapeutic drugs. This also circumvents the risky and costly R&D challenges in identifying and/or producing potent immune responses against cancer.

    This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a platform technology to mobilize immunity generated from childhood vaccines and re-direct this activity towards tumors to eradicate cancer. This will be done via two development aims.  The first aim will demonstrate the ability of the proposed technology to mobilize existing childhood vaccine responses from mice (with relevant human genetics) vaccinated with childhood vaccines (MMR, HepB, Chickpox vaccines). The second aim will be to test whether cancers with known metastasis challenges, such as ovarian and breast cancer, may be eradicated. Specifically, mice will be vaccinated with an appropriate childhood vaccine, then injected with relevant syngeneic tumors. Once the tumor is established, the proposed therapeutic will be injected to see if it can induce pre-existing immunity developed from the childhood vaccine and redirected towards the tumor. Therapeutic effect will be assessed based on the number of metastases and tumor weight/volume. If successful, this platform will provide both tumor specificity and broad applicability to a wide variety of cancers.

    This STTR Phase I project will undertake the development of iron coordination complexes as alternatives for gadolinium contrast agents which are currently used in clinical MRI diagnostic exams.  New MRI contrast agents are needed to serve the segment of the population who cannot tolerate Gd(III) agents.  This includes patients with kidney disease and those who have frequent MRI scans and may accumulate Gd(III).  The proposed research involves the study of new trivalent iron coordination complexes based on those initially studied in the co-PI?s university laboratory. New iron complexes will be prepared and studied as contrast agents in live mice to improve characteristics of the agents such as clearance from the body.  Fundamental studies of the iron complexes will add to the body of knowledge on the paramagnetic properties of iron.
    For the most promising Fe(III) contrast agents, the synthetic procedures will be adapted for large scale preparation and purity determination.  Iron MRI contrast agents may also be beneficial to society by reducing gadolinium in water supply.  Furthermore, iron as an abundant element is less expensive and more readily available in the USA than is gadolinium. The commercialization of iron MRI contrast agents will create jobs in chemical manufacturing, sales, and in health-related occupations.

    The lead Fe(III) coordination complex on which this project is based produces longitudinal (T1) relaxivity of water protons that rival clinically used Gd(III) complexes at 4.7 Tesla, both under in vitro conditions and also in live mice. Importantly, these complexes contain macrocyclic ligands that stabilize iron in the trivalent state (negative redox potentials versus NHE) and do not produce reactive oxygen species even in the presence of ascorbate as a reductant and peroxide.  The importance of outersphere water and innersphere water interactions will be studied by varying the coordinating pendent groups on the macrocyclic ligand which is bound to Fe(III).   The ancillary group will be varied to increase binding to serum proteins and to modify the clearance route of the contrast agents either through kidneys or through hepatobiliary routes.  The complexes will be optimized for kinetic inertness towards release of iron under biologically relevant conditions.  Toxicity studies in cell culture will be carried out on each of the new complexes. This research will focus on both pilot scale preparation for the study of the Fe(III) complexes in vitro and also on larger scale preparations and HPLC analysis of the most promising new derivatives.  In vivo MRI scans in mice on a 4.7 T scanner will be used to track the distribution and clearance of the iron contrast agents as a function of time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it will serve as a one-stop power conversion solution across the power conversion industries. The proposed Power Converter can convert power directly from AC-DC, DC-DC, DC-AC and AC-AC in a single stage without an interim AC or DC link. The said power converter can take fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage as input and can deliver another fixed frequency, variable frequency or DC voltage at the output. The voltage can be stepped up or down and the power can flow back and forth in the said power converter. Having all the power conversion features in one hardware can serve almost all power conversion applications such as aircraft/spacecraft/ship, hybrid/electrical vehicle, renewable energy, automation industry and almost all other power conversion needs by a mere change of software. Such technology has a potential to become a mass-produced commodity and in effect the cost of the power converter can be dramatically reduced across all industries, Market research organization has estimated that by 2020, the power converter market will be valued at $65 billion. Therefore, the commercial impact of this one stop power converter solution will be significant.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will introduce a multifunctional power converter with single stage power conversion. By employing bi-directional 4-quadrant wide band gap switch, intelligent filters at input and output, advanced pulse width modulation and commutation scheme a more efficient, robust, smaller foot print, low-weight power converter will be realized which will convert power from input to output much faster with reduced loss and at the same time it will not need any bulky DC or AC link in between. By operating less number of semiconductor switches at a given time the loss and size of the power converter will be reduced. By having intelligent filter, high power quality at the input and output will be achieved. The multifunctional use of this power converter will cut down the number of on board power converters in aircraft/spacecraft/ship in a system level which will provide multi-fold benefit in terms of fuel economy. By having less loss, the power consumption will be reduced and by having smaller size and weight the payload will be less, which will improve the fuel economy. By reducing number of on board power converters the on-board weight will be reduced further. Therefore, overall fuel economy will be significantly improved.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to drive the next generation of advanced computing power and performance, by manufacturing integrated circuits, the fundamental units of electronic systems, at length scales of 7 nm and smaller. Today?s central processing units (CPUs) each contain 7.2 Bn chips and over 1.2 sextillion chips are manufactured per year to meet computing demands. Next generation technology is expected to enable artificial intelligence and machine learning through both conventional computing and potentially neuromorphic paradigms, bringing to reality transformative applications such as self-driving cars and smart buildings. As Moore?s law continues to set the pace of technological advancement, chipmakers will deploy new EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography tools, using light of 13.5 nm to pattern integrated circuits or chip architecture into silicon wafers, for the next three generations of technology. Chipmakers strive to bring about the readiness of EUV technology in 2019. The global demand for next generation electronics is forever increasing as the population grows above 7 Bn. However, the global supply of electronics constantly faces challenges to reduce costs and deliver technology beyond Moore?s Law.

    The proposed project addresses the challenges related to high volume manufacturing at the 7 nm node for lithography tools and its components. For example, an EUV photomask, a high commodity component, patterns and replicates integrated circuit design into silicon wafers. Current EUV photomasks have a sub-optimal manufacturing yield of ~60% and suffer from defectivity which arises during fabrication of its architecture. During operational use the photomask sustains damage from the debris generated by the EUV plasma light source that implants in the mask and inevitably replicates in the wafer, destroying the integrated chip pattern. In high volume manufacturing, these issues manifest in the wafer yield, the reusability of a mask, and drive the need for high cost real-time inspection and metrology. A new EUV photomask which promises greater robustness to defects, a higher manufacturing yield, more reusability of masks in operations and a longer lifetime is presented. The goals of the project are to evaluate new integrated architecture for the EUV mask design, develop a higher yield fabrication process and characterize the EUV performance. More robust photomasks reduce the capital outlay required for in-situ metrology and inspection and ultimately bring down the cost of next generation electronics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is a substantial reduction of leakage in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. HDPE is a type of plastic commonly used for water, oil, and gas distribution pipe systems. Billions of gallons of treated water are lost daily across the US due to leaking pipes, resulting in massive revenue loss, environmental and property damage, and energy waste. Furthermore, millions of metric tons of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, escape every year into the atmosphere through leaking pipes. Most leaks occur at pipe joints and by wirelessly monitoring each joint for leaks, as a part of a smart infrastructure network, major leak reduction can be achieved. The commercial impact of the project is extensive, as smart infrastructure networks are increasingly being implemented and expanded, sensor and wireless communication technology has advanced significantly in recent years, and the rate of piping infrastructure installations, replacements, and repairs are accelerating across the US and globally.

    The proposed project aims to demonstrate a prototype capable of detecting a leak in electrofusion joints and wirelessly communicate the leak to an external network. Such joint monitoring system is highly desirable as pipe leaks can go undetected for an extended period of time. Moreover, once detected, leaks can be difficult and expensive to locate, especially as pipes are commonly buried underground or situated at hard-to-reach or remote locations. The challenge that comes with this  is to provide a reliable local power source for the sensing unit that can be on standby for up to 50 years. A second challenge is to generate a signal, powered by the local power source, that can be transmitted to the surface and notify a leak to an external signal receiver. A water-activated battery combined with a radio-frequency identification (RFID) transmitter will be developed for this purpose. RFID technology is extensively used in a broad range of industries due to its low-cost and good reliability . This technology is, therefore, an excellent candidate for providing an affordable joint leak detection system.

    This SBIR Phase I project seeks to transform treatment regimens for individuals suffering from malaria infections. Malaria, particularly caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) and Plasmodium ovale (P. ovale) remain a potential cause of morbidity and mortality amongst the 2.85 billion people living at risk of infection. The only drug currently available for treatment therapy for P. vivax and P. ovale is primaquine, which can cause life-threatening anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Clinicians often do not prescribe primaquine due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals who are born with G6PD deficiency. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) are urgently searching for a reliable assay for the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency to effectively treat patients and aid in the eradication of P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. This novel assay proposed will quantify G6PD and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration simultaneously from a finger stick sample. This system comprises a single test strip coupled with a reflectance-based meter and cell phone application with Blue Tooth connectivity to incorporate a patient?s I.D., test results, global tracking, and history of treatment. It is projected that this point-of-care assay will be used to screen >23 million people for G6PD within 5 years of launch and generate over $27.5 million in compounded revenue. In the long term, the novel assay will create a universal point-of-care platform that can be utilized for other diseases or conditions that affect patients in the Unites States for which point-of-care assays are not currently available.

    The proposed novel platform will quantify both Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) and hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations simultaneously from a single finger stick sample using a point-of-care (POC) reflectance-based meter. There is currently no such device on the market, which is urgently needed to screen patients being treated for P. vivax and P. ovale malaria. A significant portion (8%) of the world population is G6PD deficient, which places these individuals at risk for life-threatening anemia after treatment with current therapeutics such as primaquine against malaria. The POC assay utilizes a novel lysis and reagent layer membrane platform to enable a reflectance-based meter to measure non-over lapping wavelengths to quantify G6PD and Hgb concentrations. In this proposal, a functional prototype reflectance-based meter and data collection software will be constructed and compared to readings obtained using the current ?gold standard? Konica Minolta spectrophotometer. Secondly, the POC assay will be validated through performance testing using a G6PD-deficient whole blood specimen bank provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH). Concordance of the data obtained from 20 samples for the proposed assay will be compared to the World Health Organization?s (WHO) approved spectrophotometric method for measuring G6PD and an FDA approved method for measuring Hgb. Success will be indicated by an R2 > 0.95, which demonstrates linear equivalency, as well as a demonstration that 90% of the data points fall within 2 sigma of each value. A POC assay that can simultaneously screen patients for both G6PD deficiency and Hgb levels will allow clinicians to treat patients with P. vivax and P. ovale malaria infections effectively and aid in the eradication of malaria.

    in strong magnetic fields will be developed, tested and refined.  A vapor-cell
    probe suitable for sensing strong magnetic fields will be designed, fabricated,
    and tested.  Laboratory experiments will be performed to measure the atomic response
    to magnetic fields in the range of 1 Tesla at ppm sensitivity levels.  The method
    will also be tested in time-varying and switching magnetic fields, on timescales

- abstractText: "This NSF SBIR Phase I project takes a unique holistic approach to
    both tumor imaging and cancer drug delivery.  This approach harnesses cancer cell
    proteins already in the body to allow selective delivery of tumor imaging agents
    or cancer-killing drugs to, and into, cancer cells.  By choosing cancer-specific
    targeting proteins, the drugs will be transported primarily into cancer cells
    and undesirable off-target enrichment will be diminished.  The goal is to mitigate
    drug uptake in non-cancerous fast-growing cells like; heart cells, bone marrow,
    skin or hair follicles.  Treated patients will benefit from improved effectiveness
    of their cancer therapies.  Such selective delivery should permit lower dosages
    of drug to be administered while also lowering the risks of unwanted, problematic
    side-effects. This cost-effective approach is well supported by the NSF?s core
    mission for the technical development of innovative drug delivery systems. \n\nIt
    remains challenging to provide sensitive tumor diagnosis and near-simultaneous
    assessments of response to cancer treatments in treated individuals.  Of all the
    standard monitoring modalities, radiographic examination has been the most widely
    used to measure treatment response.  However, some studies suggest up to 10-40%
    of cancers may not be measurable by currently available technologies.  Various
    delivery approaches have been used to take advantage of endogenous molecules to
    transport imaging agents or drugs with increased specificity into cancer cells.
    \ Most of these approaches utilize macromolecular ligands or cell surface receptor
    binding approaches.  This proposal takes a mechanistically innovative small-molecule
    approach.  By harnessing the activities of endogenous inflammatory proteins produced
    in abundance by cancer cells and by cells within the tumor micro-environment,
    small molecule cancer drugs can be transported with efficiency to the site of
    their intended effect.  Selective and accurate placement of a chemically-related
    diagnostic agent into cancer cells should allow a cost-effective, more personalized
    and exceedingly sensitive view of treatment response."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to address the massive unmet need of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which affects over 12 million Americans and results in over 65,000 amputations each year. This project will provide the proof of concept for a novel drug delivery technique that will improve the durability of procedures to restore blood flow in PAD patients. The result technology will help reduce the burden of disease while reducing the significant societal and health system costs caused by amputations.

    The proposed project will address the challenge of providing controlled drug dose to arteries of varying diameter and length. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients have atherosclerotic lesions that are long and diffuse, requiring treatment to multiple sites with different vessel diameters and lengths. Existing drug delivery platforms require the use of multiple, expensive devices to treat these patients. This project will demonstrate that a single ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery catheter can provide drug delivery to different artery diameters and lengths, providing significant potential cost and time savings during endovascular procedures. In order apply the desired drug dose to arteries of varying size, real time imaging feedback will be used to adjust the treatment settings to compensate for changes in size. To achieve this goal, ex vivo swine arteries of different sizes will be treated under physiological flow conditions while varying the treatment parameters in order to determine the effect of vessel size on delivered drug dose. From this project, algorithms that can control drug dose to match varying artery diameter will be developed for future in vivo animal model studies.

    improve the standard of care within corrective surgery for spinal deformity. Approximately
    55,000 patients with spinal deformity seek improvement in their reduced quality
    of life through surgery each year in the US. The goal of these surgeries is to
    mechanically adjust and fix the spine into a biomechanically balanced position.
    \ It is common for surgeons to plan these intensive surgeries before the operation.
    \ However, the operating room environment introduces many challenges that make
    it difficult for the surgeon to measure the contour of the patient's spine as
    it changes during surgery.  Current commercial offerings rely on radiation-based
    imaging which involves significant operative delays, ionizing radiation exposure,
    and narrow 2-dimensional fields of view.  These suboptimal solutions contribute
    to the high rates of continued postoperative deformity along with the need for
    repeated surgeries. This project focuses on the development of imaging technology
    that will enable real-time, 3D, whole-spine assessments of a patient's spinal
    alignment with significant reduction in both time per alignment assessment and
    radiation exposure compared to current standards. By providing real-time, quantitative
    feedback to surgeons during these cases, the technology stands to greatly improve
    surgical outcomes and reduce the need for repeat operations. \n\nThis project
    repurposes the functionality of an off-the-shelf optical tracking system by coupling
    it with novel hardware and software registration algorithms.  When coupled with
    these enhancements, the camera system will enable rapidly-generated, quantitative
    measurements of a patient's spine while in the operating room.  By leveraging
    technology that is already present in the majority of surgical centers, the path
    to commercialization for this innovation is greatly accelerated. This removes
    the need for most centers to purchase additional capital equipment, while also
    integrating seamlessly into a system that is familiar to many surgeons. The expansion
    of this high-precision technology will also enable more data-driven and patient-specific
    decisions to be made for a variety of surgeries The project is led by a multidisciplinary
    team of scientists, engineers, and world-class neurosurgeons with experience in
    translating medical devices into impactful commercial products. The aims within
    this project include the development of novel tracking-system augmentation hardware,
    image-analysis algorithms, optimization of accuracy via benchtop testing, and
    validation via testing with cadaveric specimens.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase 1 project will study how communications feedback loops effect online learning, especially in group settings. The explosion of online learning experiences in recent years, in which many courses fail to engage learners or help them achieve their academic and professional goals, has put focus on the problem of engagement. Interest in online learning remains high, as it presents an opportunity to broaden the reach of institutions and companies, but success rates in broadly available learning experiences are low. Built upon foundational research in computational social science, the project will use specialized video and text chat tools to collect data from groups engaged in synchronous online learning, analyze and categorize patterns of communication, and give feedback to students to help them have better, more successful experiences online. In keeping with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, the project applies emerging innovations in artificial intelligence to the problem of delivering high-quality learning at scale. While most applications focus on individual learners and creating new personalized educational pathways, this project highlights the importance of collective learning and the power of peer engagement to help all members of a learning community reach their goals together.


    This project introduces several innovations in data capture and analytics, as well as feedback to learners while they are collaborating online. While many students use online collaboration tools such as discussion boards, chat, and video, this project focuses on providing interventions to change behavior in real-time. During conversations, such as those happening when people brainstorm to solve a problem or work on shared assignments, certain vocal patterns indicate engagement, reveal unstated agreements and discords, and expose individual biases. Using deep learning and data modeling, real-time feedback about conversational dominance is generated and shown to learners while they are speaking. The project further explores the effect of machine-generated insights about what happened during the collaboration, and makes recommendations about behavior modifications, based on predictive models. For more nuanced insights, these data are paired with facial-gestural data, such as nodding or raising one?s eyebrows. Together, these innovations combine data that has never been collected at scale before with social science data models uniquely applied to online learning. The goal of the research project is to prove that insights like these have a net positive effect on learning outcomes and raise the level of satisfaction with online learning experiences that incorporate these tools.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to improve the commercial viability of technology that enables the real time measurement and control of landfill gas extraction systems. It has the potential to improve the economics of the Landfill Gas to Energy (LFG-E) market and reduce the environmental impact of landfills. With industry-wide implementation, annual revenues from existing LFG-E projects could be increased by over $450 million. The additional energy produced would power over 350,000 homes. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas (GHG), and the EPA estimates that in 2011, emissions from landfills accounted for nearly 17.5% of generation from all manmade sources in the US. The associated reduction in GHG emissions from improved landfill gas collection would be equivalent to the emissions of over 3.6 billion gallons of gasoline or 76 million barrels of oil. Furthermore, because of the improved economics, this Phase II project could encourage the development of new LFG-E projects, further expanding the size and value of this market. According to EPA estimates, currently undeveloped sites could account for an additional 850 MW of power generation, enough to power over 508,000 homes.

    The technical objectives of the project are 1) to reduce the cost of various system components, and 2) to address new product requirements related to third party safety and other certifications that are demanded by the market. The approach to cost reduction is to replace several commercially available off-the-shelf components (specifically, NDIR gas sensors and an electrically-actuated control valve) with custom designed alternatives that can meet product functional requirements at a 30% reduction in cost. In order to achieve the certifications that are demanded by the market it will be necessary to define the specific standards and protection concepts that are applicable, and then re-engineer hardware in accordance with these standards. This will involve a combination of component substitution and system re-design, depending on the specific protection concept(s) and hazardous location classification that are identified. The research will build upon the reliability and product functionality improvements that were a key outcome of the Phase I project, and successful completion of the research goals will enable more widespread adoption of real time control technology in the landfill gas industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be the discovery of new ionization technology for use with mass spectrometry.  This technology will enable lower cost, lower energy use, and reduced user expertise, which may potentially drive mass spectrometry into large and underserved markets such as medical diagnostics and field portable instruments designed specifically for use in homeland security, bedside diagnostics, or bio-threat detection. The new technology changes the current understanding of ionization processes used in mass spectrometry and provides opportunities for new innovations to advance science through improved measurements, impacting fields such as health, safety, and security. The aims of this Phase II project are to develop interfaces to incorporate the platform developed in Phase I on most major mass spectrometer manufacturer's instruments and to develop technologies for rapid automate analyses even of surfaces.  The research of Phase II is aimed to better understand the fundamentals of this new technology in order to drive commercial success in high sensitivity rapid analyses at a competitive price. Mass spectrometers are widely used representing a $4 billion industry of which ionization technology represents a significant commercial opportunity.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to revolutionize ionization in mass spectrometry by providing commercial products that utilize a simple and powerful ionization technology. The newly discovered process spontaneously converts large and small, volatile and nonvolatile compounds to the gas-phase ions necessary for analysis using mass spectrometry without employing currently used high cost lasers or high voltage. The method is broadly applicable for analysis of compounds such as drugs, lipids, carbohydrate conjugates, peptides, and proteins directly from bodily fluids or tissue, as well as synthetic polymers and inorganic catalytic surfaces.  This technology is anticipated to augment or even replace older ionization methods in applications such as clinical analyses, pharmaceuticals, forensics, environmental, and food safety. The aims of the Phase II project are to implement the multifunctional platform developed during Phase I on a variety of manufacturer's instruments, automate the process to allow lower cost and faster analyses, and provide an automated surface analysis platform.  Besides determining the best sample preparation methodologies and choice of solvents/matrices, the research objectives include innovative automated sample introduction technologies that eliminate the need for a conventional "ion source" while reducing the pumping requirements, which currently hinder development of small, low-cost portable mass spectrometers.

    Research Phase II project is to commercialize Pyrochem Catalyst Company's (PCC)
    catalyst materials.   These catalyst materials are unique in that the catalytically
    active metal is atomically dispersed in a rigid crystalline matrix.  This imparts
    unparalleled thermal stability, even at temperatures in excess of 1000°C.  Conventional
    catalysts typically require much higher precious metal loadings (as much as 20
    times) to achieve the same activity as the materials developed in this project
    and at high temperatures those active metals can agglomerate into large clusters
    reducing their performance and the lifetime of the catalyst.  The series of catalysts
    developed in this project are designed in a way that all precious metal is optimally
    utilized and protected.  This includes resistance from sulfur poisoning and the
    accumulation of carbon when operating under severe conditions.  This makes these
    materials ideal for high temperature processes such as steam methane reforming
    for hydrogen generation, autothermal reforming for syngas production, syngas generation
    in oxygen transport membranes (OTM), and exhaust oxidation in automotive catalytic
    convertors.     \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II STTR program are to build
    on the success of the Phase I objectives that developed a low cost and continuous
    catalyst manufacturing method for producing the pyrochlore powders that are the
    basis for the proposed catalyst product.  The method may be equally effective
    for producing other types of mixed metal oxides like perovskites and fluorites.
    In Phase II, PCC will construct and test a scaled-up production platform, following
    the design elements of the proof of concept demonstrated in Phase I.  The new
    unit will be designed to manufacture proprietary pyrochlore powders at a rate
    with a hundred-fold increase over production rates of the Phase I unit.  The Phase
    II technical efforts also examine a range of catalyst synthesis parameters like
    oxidant gas concentration/composition, temperature distribution in the production
    unit, precursor residence times, synthesis solution chemistry, and optimizing
    heat and mass transport.  Through a subaward, powders produced from the process
    will be characterized and tested for activity by the National Energy Technology
    Labs, Morgantown, WV.  The overall goal of this project is the development of
    a high throughput / high yield manufacturing process that produces high performance
    catalysts for commercial sale."

    to develop a handheld, one-step paper-based device for rapid self-testing of sexually
    transmitted infections. The company aims to replace lab-based assays for Chlamydia
    trachomatis (CT) and expand testing access to previously unreachable settings.
    The technology combines the ease-of-use and very low cost of rapid point-of-care
    (POC) diagnostics with the high accuracy of lab-based tests, enabling unprecedented
    reliability at the POC and at home. CT infection is one of the most prevalent
    STIs in the US. An estimated three million new cases occur each year with direct
    annual medical costs of greater than $3.5 billion. Untreated CT, symptomatic or
    not, may cause long term pregnancy complications, even infertility. Traditional
    lab-based CT assays prevent the ability to test-and-treat within one patient visit.
    This delay results in a high number of cases that do not get treatment due to
    loss-to-follow up (especially for young STI patients) and increased infection
    transmission. Phase Diagnostics? novel device will be: (1) Fast: Results to the

    (3) Accurate: Sensitivity and specificity on par with lab-based assays; (4) Convenient:
    Handheld with no required equipment or training. \n\nThe key innovation of the
    company's novel device is to use aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) to selectively
    pre-concentrate the pathogenic bacteria prior to detection, thereby dramatically
    enhancing the accuracy of conventional rapid LFA POC technology and enabling the

    optimization work initiated in Phase I and perform additional device robustness
    studies. As these experiments near completion, the company will work with a contract
    prototyper to design and develop prototypes based on the final optimized device
    components. At the same time, the company will establish small scale manufacturing
    processes to ensure that it can generate a reproducible pilot batch. The company

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project evaluates the feasibility of constructing vivid, full-color, reflective display modules for large-area outdoor digital signage driven by dielectric elastomers suitable for pilot testing.  Completion of Phase II objectives is expected to have the following impact:  Commercially, the availability of new signage products will create significant economic impact through partial capture of the $14.2B domestic billboard and sign manufacturing market.  Up to 10% of US zoning codes are estimated to prohibit LED-based (light emitting diode) signage while potentially permitting a reflective digital signage technology, expanding the domestic market up to $5.6B, with a 10x impact worldwide.  Environmentally, greenhouse gas reduction is expected as an alternative to LED-based technology; up to 40x reduction in energy consumption is anticipated relative to LEDs. Additionally, billboard wrap waste will be reduced by replacing printed signage. Scientifically, the use of dielectric elastomers as a class of materials in products would be promoted through addressing technological and manufacturing hurdles currently limiting market translation. Societally, increased impact from timely public service announcements on digital billboards displayed during natural disasters, when catching fugitives from the FBI?s Most Wanted lists, and with Amber/Silver alerts are expected through large-area digital sign proliferation.

    In phase II, electroactive polymer-based proof-of-concept display modules will be constructed and tested, ready for pilot testing with initial customers.  The low-cost display design uses unique electro-hydraulic driving principles to enable exceptional refractive index matching within the optical stack for highly vivid and reflective full-color generation.  In phase I, a functional proof-of-concept pixel array module was fabricated using scalable processes.  To achieve pilot readiness, improvements in performance, resolution, and calibration to meet advertiser standards are needed, as well as environmental qualification for outdoor operation, development of industry-conscious software control, and qualification of supply chain inputs to enable further production at scale.  Phase II research will address these technical challenges by introducing process refinements and quality control standards, conduct color calibration using existing techniques, perform industry-relevant environmental testing, work with vendors to source soft-tooled components, and develop module and multi-module control software.  The result of phase II efforts will be a calibrated and rugged one square foot, full-color, 16mm pitch, reflective display module ready for scaling to pilot production following phase II.

    develop a technology to transform swine manure into sustainable alternatives for
    petroleum-based adhesives, with a first opportunity in the asphalt market.  This
    project builds on a successful Phase I effort as well as a prior Innovation Corps
    award. The major socio-economic impact of the technology will be in rural areas,
    as it will allow pig farmers to alleviate the burden of manure management and
    create a new revenue stream.  This project also offers a novel approach to develop
    low-cost, durable, and eco-friendly construction adhesives, reduce the cost associated
    with manure management and lagoon maintenance, create new manufacturing and engineering
    jobs, and reduce our dependence on petroleum resources. Current practices for
    handling manure release carbon to the atmosphere, either from manure storage or
    anaerobic digestion of manure. In contrast, the proposed technology sequesters
    carbon in bio-adhesives, while passing nutrients to the effluents, bio-char, and
    grey water, which can then be used as fertilizer.  The Phase I research results
    have shown that bio-adhesive is more durable, lower in cost ($0.50/gallon, as
    compared with $2.00/gallon) and more eco-friendly (lower volatile organic compound
    levels) than many petroleum-based adhesives.\n \nThe core technology to be developed
    further in this effort uses thermochemical liquefaction to convert swine manure
    to bio-oil, followed by the polymerization of bio-oil to produce bio-adhesives.
    This technology will eventually enable use of the six billion gallons of swine
    manure that are generated annually in the U.S. to supply about 88 million barrels
    of bio-adhesive.  As a result of the Phase I effort, a study of the effects of
    heating rate on the yield and quality of bio-adhesive was completed; this in turn,
    helped ensure that the conversion process takes place successfully, thereby addressing
    one of the main scale-up challenges. The resulting data were used as an input
    for the design of a pilot bio-reactor, including central heaters and a heat exchanger.
    \ After the design phase, the team began the fabrication and assembly of this
    bio-reactor, and followed up with multiple trials.  In the Phase II project, building
    on these successful trials, we will complete the troubleshooting of the bio-reactor
    while finalizing the design and construction of the oil separation and polymerization
    column, and sampling valves.  These items will permit a fully-realized pilot plant
    by the end of this project."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project presents novel technology to fabricate dry, removable, reusable adhesives based on aligned polymeric nanofibers using scalable electrospinning methodologies.  This new approach offers the potential advantages of significantly lower costs and easier scale-up using nozzle-free nanofiber spinning processes. Dry reusable adhesives as a replacement for messy liquid glues will improve product safety and reduce environmental impact. Removable and reusable adhesive tapes and labels will also eliminate waste and facilitate product recycling. The resulting products will have strong shear adhesion and easy peel, leading to broad application with a wide range of substrates like glass, metal, wall board, and plastics. Proof-of-concept samples have confirmed market-driven value propositions. The Phase II project will develop commercial products and applications for consumer and industrial applications, for automotive assembly systems, for decorative wall murals, and for medical device and health care uses. Fiber spinning and collection techniques will be engineered to improve product performance, reduce costs and improve scalability of the manufacturing process.

    The Phase I project has confirmed proof-of-concept dry adhesive samples with shear adhesion strengths exceeding 20 N/cm2 in dynamic mode and 45 N/cm2 in dead weight mode.  The resulting samples have low peel strength and are reusable. In Phase II, the electrospinning process will be optimized using novel polymer blend systems to achieve performance targets for specific customer product development. The nozzleless electrospinning process will be scaled to the pilot level for product testing and to provide the engineering design basis for commercial manufacture. A continuous roll-to-roll process to produce aligned nanofibers will break new ground in the electrospinning industry.  New applications in medical devices have been proposed by strategic partners to capitalize on the self-adhesion properties of these materials.  Dry adhesive applicator systems will be developed to allow the aligned adhesive nanofibers to conform to surface asperities. With the Phase I success of proof-of-concept prototypes, the Phase II effort will move the development of aligned nanofiber dry adhesives into the market introduction phase in preparation for commercial manufacture and sales.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on establishing full-scale production parameters, quality control procedures, operational testing and commercialization of cutting-edge compartmentalized vacuum composites. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in cold chain shipping, storage, building insulation, automobiles, aerospace and other advanced markets. The first application is in the cold chain shipping industry, for packaging and storage of temperature sensitive materials. A new generation of thin (less than 1"), light weight, highly insulated (R value 25-30), durable, and long service life boxes will meet a critical need in this area. Temperature-sensitive products such as vaccines, blood, organs, and diagnostic specimens are shipped using insulated containers, and the new materials to be developed will permit longer shipping duration, higher impact resistance, and re-usability. The cold chain shipping market includes the Red Cross, blood banks, pharmacies, clinical trial shippers, diagnostic centers, life science material providers and whole sale distributors. The annual United States market potential in life sciences packaging is estimated at $291 million.  The resulting materials also have significant potential for uses in permanent and temporary structures, and in a variety of transportation applications.

    Successful completion of the Phase I work has resulted in cost-effective (an order of magnitude lower expected cost), stronger (ten times the impact resistance of Styrofoam), lightweight, thin (less than 1"), highly-insulating (R 16-22), compartmentalized vacuum composite materials.  An exclusive machining capability was also demonstrated, whereby vacuum composites can be cut and sized on-site without degradation in thermal performance, an issue which affects current vacuum insulation panels (VIPs).  Optimization of the developed composites to achieve targeted insulation rating, cost, and service life characteristics will be conducted during Phase II. Thermal performance, mechanical characteristics and operational performance will be evaluated for their application in cold chain shipping and in building/structural insulation. The team will also validate boxes fabricated using these materials in cold chain shipping to verify safe transportation of blood products, organs, and/or pharmaceuticals.  Based on the Phase II work, it is anticipated that these materials will be poised to replace petroleum-based foam materials and vacuum insulation panels as a high-performance and economical solution in these markets.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this SBIR Phase II project is to deliver a bio-based and functionally improved optical polymer that can be made into a lens. The lens product has commercial applications in rapidly growing mass-markets like Prescription eyewear that is growing significantly due to onslaught of myopia. Using scientific data, this proposal demonstrates an improved commercial product for myopia when compared to Polycarbonate, the most popular eyewear material in US. Work proposed in Phase II focuses on development of the polymer at large scale and its conversion to lenses using a lower-cost, one-step molding process that can also reduce current industry wastages by as much as an estimated 90%. For establishing suitability of the product towards commercial applications, the Phase II goals include product testing in lab as well as with real subjects to generate marketable data.  Finished prescription lenses are a ~$30 billion plus market, with ~70% of lens sales serving myopic patients, who will see a tremendous benefit from using our ultra-clear lens. Broader impact of this technology proposal is to make eyeglasses exponentially more affordable in contrast to today's high costs. Price controls exerted by market monopolies like Luxottica and Essilor on finished lenses pose a huge barrier to base of pyramid markets. Our easy-to-make lens technology simplifies the eyewear supply chain for benefit of these unconventional markets and can lower costs dramatically for billions of people around the world, who are separated by a pair of glasses from otherwise blindness.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to leverage properties of sugars to build an optically clear, transparent polymer of good refractive index, low dispersion and low density. In commercial applications of this polymer as a prescription lens, it thus represents a state-of-the-art product that combines the best properties of various incumbent eyewear materials into one.  A key intellectual merit of this SBIR project is to achieve a plastic with optical properties similar to glass, a gold standard in optical materials. Our chemistry platform is 90% bio-based, a unique value proposition in prescription lens industry, where use of extremely toxic and hazardous chemicals is common. Phase I work has also led to the development of a novel route of manufacturing lenses which can lower cost barriers for setting up optical labs, expedite the process for making prescription lenses and cut wastages in current prescription industry. In Phase II, our goal is to methodically develop the process for making lenses using Novol's polymers and obtain data to translate the proposed technology to a commercially preferred lens product with special benefits to myopic patients.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project extends to industry stakeholders holding financial
    interests that are impacted by climate change. Climate change has a scientifically
    evident impact on the intensity, duration, and frequency of extreme weather events.
    It has become imperative for organizations in all sectors to gain a clear understanding
    of the impacts of climate change on their business so as to inform strategic planning
    and risk management strategies. Those in the risk transfer industry, in particular
    reinsurance companies, are the most likely early adopters given their technical
    sophistication and their increasing and acute awareness of the financial impacts
    climate change now has on their bottom line. Thus, the company's goal is to penetrate
    the reinsurance industry as an entry point to the more broadly defined risk transfer
    industry. Subsequently, the company will utilize the platform to address problems
    in agricultural investment, real estate investment, and energy planning - all
    sectors that will be adversely impacted by climate change in specific, well-defined
    ways. The adaptation in each of these sectors is vital to the well-being and prosperity
    of the ultimate stakeholder: the American taxpayer. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project aims to harness industry knowledge and expand on the
    technical work conducted during the company's Phase I project, with the objective
    of building a modular software platform generalizable to multiple key climate
    change hazards and extensible to other strategically identified sectors. The knowledge
    gathered via customer discovery interviews in Phase I will serve as a guide for
    product development. The technical work completed in Phase I, in particular extreme
    precipitation modeling under climate change and its application to the risk transfer
    sector, will serve as a foundation for expansion into the modeling of additional
    hazards. There are currently no tools available that integrate climate change
    informatics into risk management at scale. The company aims to address this problem
    through the translation of physics-guided statistical modeling to a commercial
    software platform. Upon conclusion of the Phase II project, the company expects
    to have a completed product that will house data on additional hazards exacerbated
    by climate change, with applications in the agriculture, commercial real estate,
    and the energy sectors. The company will show product value through sector-tailored
    software demonstrations and case studies that demonstrate return on investment
    to be realized by using this platform.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance a novel probe-based direct transfer (PBDT) printing technology for manufacturing flexible hybrid electronic (FHE) devices. PBDT promises to deliver unprecedented selective, high-fidelity component transfer of a broad range of low-dimensional, high-performance electronic components with diverse architectures and sizes to flexible substrates. The technology will accelerate manufacturing capability to meet a critical need in the flexible and printed electronics market. The development of a stand-alone, automatic PBDT tool will provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers an unparalleled solution for integrating high-performance thin and ultra-thin electronic materials into next-generation flexible devices. The impact on the market and on daily life has the potential to be transformative, with everything from consumer devices (e.g., flexible phones and tablets), to imaging and sensing, to health care and homeland security being improved by advancements in flexible device manufacturing. Furthermore, PBDT will enable new directions in flexible device research and product development. 

     The overall objective of the Phase II project is to produce a prototype of a commercial version of a PBDT tool. In addition, detailed performance specs of the process and tool will be established, and functional FHE devices will be assembled using automated PBDT printing. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that the PBDT approach of handling a flexible substrate as both a stamp and as the destination substrate allows for defect-free transfer of semiconductor components that are an order of magnitude thinner and more complex laterally than what conventional tools can handle. Based on the Phase I accomplishments, Phase II funding will be used to develop and demonstrate a prototype tool that will serve as the template for a fully automated commercial product. Successful commercialization of PBDT will require advances in PBDT processes and hardware; therefore, the specific objectives of the Phase II project are focused on (i) characterizing the full process space of PBDT technology, (ii) demonstrating a complete process flow for assembling and metalizing functional FHE devices, and (iii) validating the prototype in terms of printing rate and fidelity. The collaborating university partner will contribute to the design and fabrication of thin and ultra-thin silicon components to assess the performance of the tool and demonstrate viable FHE sensors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the advancement of a novel water treatment process that reduces membrane fouling and significantly lowers water treatment costs. Membrane filtration is one of the primary water treatment technologies to address the global challenge of water scarcity. However, the membrane industry suffers from low productivity and high operational cost caused by fouling. Over 95% of the water treatment plants in US that employ membrane filtration currently operate at only 30-50% of their design capacity. Our revolutionary pretreatment technology not only mitigates fouling, but also increases system productivity by up to 400% and decreases the required membrane cleaning frequency by a factor of 50, thereby saving water, money and energy. The process can reduce both the capital expense and annual operational cost of water treatment plants by roughly 25%. Our innovation is also applicable to saline water, so it can be used as a pretreatment for desalination, and it can address another major environmental challenge by removing phosphorus from wastewater and thereby reducing the prevalence of blooms of toxic algae.

    This SBIR Phase II project will continue our scale-up and commercialization activities for our pretreatment technology to improve the performance of membranes in water treatment processes with respect to contaminant removal, process productivity, and energy efficiency, compared to existing technologies. The process relies on application of a proprietary particle in a novel reactor and has been demonstrated in our Phase I work. The objectives of the Phase II work are (1) scale-up and construction of larger treatment modules using commercially suitable materials and fabrication processes; (2) testing under more aggressive operational conditions; (3) improving particle production, delivery, and disposal processes; and (4) evaluating the particles' suitability as an economic approach to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater. The economic analysis will also be updated using data collected in Phase II study. The effort will advance the technical readiness level (TRL) of our process to TRL6, while providing essential data for further development and credibility for marketing. On completion of Phase II, we expect to be prepared for deployment in small-scale commercial systems treating one million gallons per day, and for testing in larger systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project comes from addressing the thermal challenges brought about by the significant increase in transistor density that semiconductors have experienced over the past few decades. This trend has enabled many advancements ranging from high performance servers to Internet of Things devices. Still, with every advance in chip technology, the difficulty of chip cooling continues to increase. Three major thermal interface material (TIM) market segments exist: polymer composites, metallic materials and phase-change materials. Commercial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) will create a fourth market segment that will supplant existing TIMs, initially in the chip testing market and eventually extending into servers, high performance computing and Internet of Things devices. CNT researchers and small businesses have made little progress towards a commercial TIM product. Among other factors, this failure is driven by poor positioning in the crowded low-cost TIM space, which is currently dominated by thermal greases and pads. Progress towards a viable solution lies in the strategic alignment of product features with industry pain points. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a means to scale the ability to produce CNT based TIMs as well as to further improve their performance.

    The technical objectives of this SBIR Phase II project are to: 1) scale up of the CNT TIM manufacturing process to achieve a production capacity of 200,000 sq. in of product annually and to 2) enhance the conductivity of the CNT array by a factor of 3x or more to facilitate entry into the TIM1 and TIM2 market. This project will ultimately develop processes that will translate into achieving production scale CNT based thermal interface materials for the first time in the world. Scale up will be achieved through a combination of physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition processes developed on tools designed specifically for CNT production. In Phase I of this research effort, two commercial products aimed at the semiconductor chip testing market were developed and validated through collaboration with leading chip manufacturers. In addition to the chip testing market segment, in Phase II products will be developed for entry into the TIM1 and Internet of Things markets.

- abstractText: "Diesel engines remain critical to global economies, but are under
    threat from increasingly-stringent emissions regulations. Many alternatives, like
    spark-ignition and electric vehicles, sacrifice some of the performance or range
    benefits of Diesel-style operation. This creates a market need for technologies
    that can maintain Diesel engine performance while remaining decoupled from the
    dirty emissions of Diesel fuel. This proposal centers on the development of the
    ?ClearFlame Combustion System? (CFCS): a novel combustion process that enables
    Diesel-style engines to combust low-carbon alternative fuels like ethanol and
    methanol without sacrificing the power possible with traditional Diesel combustion.
    Further, the sootless nature of alternative fuels such as methanol and ethanol
    obviates the need for a Diesel particulate filter, and enables stoichiometric
    air-fuel ratios to eliminate the need for selective catalytic reduction of NOx
    (smog). The engine technology has the potential to alter the dynamics of any market
    dominated by Diesel engines (including heavy-duty transportation, agriculture,
    rail, and power generation) and can be licensed to, or jointly developed with,
    OEMs for simple integration into their existing product lines. Phase I results
    have shown a 30% increase in engine torque at increased efficiency, while engine-out
    soot emissions are more than 100x lower than that of Diesel engines, falling under
    the 2010 EPA regulation limit without aftertreatment. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of the CFCS. The
    Phase I results showed that three critical CFCS subsystems?engine insulation,
    alcohol direct injection, and a combustion chamber optimized for stoichiometric
    combustion with exhaust gas load control?could be developed and integrated to
    achieve a previously unattainable combination of strong performance and low emissions.
    This Phase II effort will further advance these key components and demonstrate
    the benefits of the CFCS on a commercial engine platform, using CFD modeling and
    engine experiments to show the advantages of the CFCS compared to the Diesel baseline.
    The goal is to show how the CFCS enables a multi-cylinder heavy-duty engine to
    simultaneously improve power density by 30% at no loss of efficiency, while also
    achieving sootless stoichiometric exhaust conditions that are compatible with
    low-cost and highly-effective three-way catalysis (the same system that enables
    gasoline and natural gas engines to be much cleaner than Diesel). A Phase II prototype
    demonstration would realize a longtime industry goal of integrating three-way
    catalysis with a Diesel-style engine, allowing Diesel-style engines to achieve
    the emissions profile of the cleanest alternatives (like natural gas).\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently,
    70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more

    and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology
    is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond
    to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic
    clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to

    Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because
    of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents

    The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and
    subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression
    signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene
    expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be
    used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple
    types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real
    patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more
    and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project includes reducing emission of Diesel engines' toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) in challengingly low temperature exhaust operations, while eliminating damaging urea deposits saving warranty costs for vehicle manufacturers, saving fuel, reducing greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O as well as particulate matter, while potentially enabling downsizing the complex and costly diesel emission control systems. The novel technology developed in this SBIR project may be configured for retrofitting existing diesel platforms.  Nitrogen oxides pose risks to human respiratory and pulmonary systems, are associated with forming ground level ozone, photochemical oxidants, acid rain and fine particles, amongst a variety of their detriments, and their emission is therefore regulated. Our concept, when successful, will therefore make available a broad value proposition to the society, the environment and to the mobility industry. Finally, the insights developed into its gas phase reactions may have applications in other branches of science and technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to resolve a currently unmet need in mitigating emission of toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) from diesel engines, especially in low exhaust temperatures such as when the vehicle operates in stop-and-go, in local delivery or when idles its engine. The goal of this project is to develop a low cost, easy-to-fit and simple-to-integrate novel technology enabling low temperature Diesel NOx reduction. Continuing our successful Phase I research results, in this Phase II project more advanced prototypes will be developed and tested in low-temperature exhaust conditions, demonstrating rapid reduction of NOx on a commercially-available Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst, while evaluating the impact on lowering greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O.  High fidelity computer simulations will be heavily utilized to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms such as the gas-phase reactions as well as to accelerate the development path. The project outcome is expected to alleviate a remaining challenge in Diesel emission control and to be rapidly welcome by the Diesel engine and vehicle industry.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    enable video-rate three-dimensional (3D) imaging within two-photon microscopes
    (2PMs) by developing novel deformable membrane mirror (DMM) technology for fast,
    precise focus control. As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), 2PMs
    achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam
    to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low-energy infrared
    photons to stimulate emission in the visible spectrum. Because of the increased
    resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with
    other LSM methods, 2PMs have become widely accepted for use in the life sciences,
    specifically for neuroscience. The DMM technology developed for this project will
    address the $165 million 2PM market by delivering an electrically tunable optic
    capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an
    order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities
    enabled by this technology will propel new research in the field of neuroscience
    aimed at solving widespread, chronic medical problems like stroke and Alzheimer's
    disease. Once the 2PM entry market is addressed, this technology will be refined
    to address the much larger $5.8 billion 3D laser printing market. \n\nDuring the
    Phase I project, new mirror coatings were developed to handle the high-power lasers
    used in 2PMs. With the core DMM technology in place, this Phase II project is
    aimed primarily at control of mirror actuation and shape for reliable use in 2PMs.
    The first objective of this Phase II project will develop electronics for robust
    control of mirror actuation and shape. Objective two will center on refining the
    core DMM technology and fabrication methods to enable position sensing of the
    membrane and improve mirror stroke to satisfy customers in 2PM markets. The final
    objective will involve the creation of optical and mechanical assemblies and modules
    for incorporating the DMM technology into key microscopes. The result of this
    Phase II will be a market-ready DMM product with active focus control to address
    the growing 2PM market.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    address the design, prototype and testing of a modular tension control device
    for individual tension regulation in the composite manufacturing sector. Composites
    are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and
    the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity,
    increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling
    tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality
    product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural
    integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have
    a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from
    composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance
    on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy.
    Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites.
    This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share
    of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing
    equally fast, if not faster. \n\nThis project will solve a problem that has plagued
    the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult
    (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with
    different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger
    products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited
    the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype
    and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The
    Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central
    base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the
    use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully
    tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype
    unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field
    trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production.
    In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements
    was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed
    and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    Research (SBIR) project will be to develop a platform technology for detecting

    requires the development of more powerful bioanalytic technologies to diagnose
    disease and direct targeted therapies. This platform uses a ligation-based DNA

    Additionally, as a solution-phase assay, it is able to detect numerous clinically-relevant

    Phase II project aims to develop the first solution-phase, ultrasensitive and
    multiplex antibody assay platform for the early detection, monitoring and treatment
    of human diseases. The Antibody Detection by Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) platform
    represents a major advancement in multiplex immunoassay testing. Many current
    multiplex technologies, such as microarrays and bead-based arrays, scale poorly
    due to cross-analyte interference, and lack the analytical sensitivity to detect
    crippling diseases at the most favorable time.  The Phase I results showed the
    expanded and validated ADAP technology for the ultrasensitive and multiplex detection

    This SBIR Phase II project will fully develop and market a digital language tool previously found effective in helping non-native English speakers acquire language skills. It was found in SBIR Phase I that students using the tool improved their test scores both absolutely and relative to their peers. Spanish-speaking students learned more effectively when given native-language educational tools in multiple subjects. Competing educational tools are not designed to help those who are natively fluent in Spanish transfer their skills to a new language. Consequently, more than 40% of non-native speakers drop out. If successful, this project will bring to a wider market an existing educational product (created by a small, minority-owned business and already in use nationwide), and improve the educational opportunities for hundreds of thousands of non-native English-speaking students in both language arts and the scientific disciplines core to the National Science Foundation?s mission. Moreover, because schools face significant financial pressure to improve student achievement and because the product is competitively priced, it will be shown to be commercially viable, and a plan will be developed to expand the market for the tool outside of the state of California where it was initially studied.


    An expanding body of research has shown that language learners perform better on standardized tests when they can transfer their ability in another language (Spanish) to the acquisition of English. However, existing tools have not yet met this market need and focus instead on English-only instruction optimized for students who already speak natively. This project proposes to fully develop and market an existing language-acquisition platform found to be effective during pilot research in a large California school. SBIR Phase II research will address outstanding hypotheses suggested by Phase I results, and determine whether the tool can be easily adopted by stakeholders. Specifically, the impact of assignments chosen by teachers will be disambiguated from the use of the tool more generally, and the impact of English-only versus bilingual scaffolding will be studied in more detail to tailor the product to individual use cases. During Phase II, the product will also be integrated with existing academic systems and analytical software, and competitive per-seat pricing will be developed such that it can be marketed first within California and then nationwide by a network of resellers. A successful product will be measured by its effectiveness in closing the gap between native and non-native English speakers, at scale.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to facilitate understanding of cellular diversity in tumors, a phenomenon that contributes to acquired drug resistance. Quantifying and understanding this diversity may help predict a patient?s response to certain drugs which would allow the selection of ideal drug combinations for an individual patient?s tumor, thus enabling personalized medicine. This Phase II project will provide drug developers and researchers with a tool that can quantify diversity by correlating genetic and spatial information from tumors, providing crucial information about tumor composition that is currently missing today. This project will translate the technology into an efficient, high-throughput workflow that will enable commercialization with drug developers, researchers, and reference laboratories, generating both income and multiple job opportunities. The commercialization of this innovation will significantly impact scientific, corporate, and patient communities. Researchers will have a new tool improving drug development for cancer and other diseases, including Alzheimer?s and diabetes. Payers, such as insurance companies and the government, will save costs by eliminating unnecessary spending on treatments for patients who will not respond. Most importantly, patients will have broader access to personalized medicine through new treatments and screening methods that can help determine the optimum drug combinations for them.

    A single tumor contains multiple populations of cells that each have unique mutations, and it is necessary to understand the location and genetic differences of these cells in order to provide effective combination therapies that will not result in overall treatment failure or relapse. This Phase II project aims to provide drug developers, researchers, and physicians with a tool to correlate genetic and spatial information about individual tumors. Using a proprietary microfluidic device adhered to a standard microscope slide and tissue biopsy, incorporated with a laser-coupled microscope, this tool is capable of providing information that it is not possible to obtain from any other method today. Building upon the feasibility established during the Phase I project, Phase II will involve performing NGS to demonstrate the instrument?s usefulness in providing data for clinical research and biomarker discovery. It will also involve building a fully integrated prototype instrument with features that increase automation and throughput to make the technology economically feasible for commercialization. These developments will showcase the instrument?s value to customers as well as enable the commercial launch of a service.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in promoting clean energy technologies. More than half of the United States? greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity production. Lithium-ion batteries are a promising technology to facilitate the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries threatens the commercial viability of clean technologies. This Phase II project will develop manufacturing process technologies that reduce the capital and operating costs of the most expensive step in lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Low-cost batteries will push electric vehicles towards widespread commercial adoption. Electrification of mass-transit buses will improve urban air quality, especially for the low-income population located near bus depots. Large-scale battery systems enabled by low-cost batteries will turn renewable power generation such as solar and wind from periodic energy sources into on-demand energy sources to alleviate our dependence on fossil-fuels. This Phase II project will help lithium-ion batteries become a key technology in the successful departure from oil dependence, combat of climate change, and the United States? energy security.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for deeper understanding of the fundamental science behind the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. SEI layer quality is a key determinant of long-term battery reliability, performance, and safety, but the underlying electrochemistry that governs SEI composition and evolution remains poorly understood. This Phase II project will develop novel, in-situ diagnostics to directly measure the evolution, performance, and characteristics of the SEI layer as it is formed during lithium-ion battery manufacturing. Deeper insight into the complex morphology of the SEI layer will advance much-needed industry knowledge of battery performance, quality, and longevity. Additionally, there is a sizeable body of work in modeling the degradation of batteries throughout their lifecycle. With improved cell-level traceability, the manufacturing insights enabled by this Phase II project will expand the current understanding of the ?ideal battery? at the beginning of life and complement ongoing work on how batteries degrade over time. This insight opens the door for quality control in battery manufacturing based on more direct quality metrics such as longevity and reliability rather than indirect metrics such as beginning of life capacity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be the development and demonstration of a new manufacturing technology for lightweight bio-based plastics.  Plastic produced from plant materials can have lower environmental impact than petroleum-based plastics, but price and performance issues have limited their adoption. In Phase I, Grow Plastics demonstrated the ability to produce lightweight, low cost, thermally stable 100% bio-based packaging products.  In Phase II, Grow Plastics will continue the development of its products while also working to develop a full-scale manufacturing line. The goal of the technology is to replace billions of pounds of petroleum-based plastic with a lower density plastic requiring half as much material, which is made from plants.

    This SBIR Phase II research project proposes to continue the development of a new manufacturing process for layered structures in biomaterials.  Grow Plastics has demonstrated the ability to generate novel, high-performance layered cellular structures in biopolymers in a new manufacturing process using new machinery.  The challenge in Phase II will be to continue the development in materials from Phase I while also scaling the technology to industrial scale.  Materials science and manufacturing techniques will include polymer blending, solid state foaming, and thermal crystallization of polymer blends. Analysis techniques will include tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, thermo mechanical analysis, and evaluation of final product properties.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a sustainable, low-cost, and replicable
    method for large-scale production of micro-algal biomass. Microalgae production
    is a form of aquaculture capable of producing valuable products including:  Nutraceuticals,
    specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, feed for finfish, shellfish, and livestock,
    as well as food for human consumption.  Moreover, microalgae can be used as a
    feedstock for biofuels while simultaneously removing CO2 from the environment.
    \  However, for the nascent algae cultivation industry to achieve its full commercial
    potential, the technology must be improved.  While typical algal cultivation relies
    on high-density cell growth, this project will focus on the science of low-density
    algal cultivation to achieve high productivity, while minimizing process requirements
    for supplemental energy and concentrated CO2.  In addition, the development of
    a closed-system photo-bioreactor with emphasis on low cost and modular design
    will allow the process to be easily replicated on a variety of lands with otherwise
    marginal value. As such, the system can become the basis for a robust aquaculture
    and biofuels industry, leading to greater economic development in marginal communities
    and a source of sustainable products for the growing world population. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to further optimize the design of the large-scale
    algal production system developed during the Phase I project to address key challenges
    in algae cultivation including frequent contamination, low productivity, and increased
    operating costs due to inefficient use of water and energy. Research activities
    will focus on four main objectives: 1) Finalize key design specifications for
    reactor geometry, materials of construction, and system components in order to
    maximize productivity and minimize capital costs; 2) optimize harvest apparatus
    design and biomass concentration procedure to further reduce water consumption;
    3) develop a new media formulation to allow for stable pH control without the
    need for concentrated CO2; and 4) refine manufacturing of the reactor bladder
    to ensure sterility, durability, and product consistency.  In addition to the
    basic algae cultivation techniques employed in Phase I, Phase II will make greater
    use of engineering /computational analyses to arrive at optimal designs.  The
    target outcome of the project is a 120,000-L closed photo-bioreactor capable of
    sustaining H. pluvialis algae production rates of greater than 9 g/m2/d for a
    minimum of 4 months without detrimental contamination.  In addition, the system
    will provide significant reductions in consumption of energy, water, and concentrated
    CO2."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to de-risk the volume manufacturability and reliability of thin crystalline power MOSFETs fabricated with a novel exfoliation technology demonstrated in Phase 1.  The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable lower cost and better performance for power devices in switching or transferring electricity under varying power requirements across the voltage spectrum in a variety of applications ranging from consumer, to communications, automotive and industrial applications.  In all of these applications, the ON resistance of the power MOSFET and IGBTs can be reduced and the switching speed and performance further improved by reducing the device thickness.  Additionally, in consumer and mobile applications, reducing the form factor of the power MOSFET devices can enable slimmer and lighter products.  A significant broader impact of this technology will be the reduction of expensive and environmentally hazardous waste treatment processes associated with wafer grinding technology used in the power MOSFET industry.  While the power MOSFETs developed using this technology can have broad commercial and societal impact, the use of this thin crystalline technology can have even broader impact across all modern semiconductor devices such as LED, PV, flexible CMOS and passive devices.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses challenges to further scaling of Power MOSFETs which are one of the key building blocks of the electronic revolution over the last few decades. While the feature size of transistors has been constantly shrinking, the substrate thickness has been increasing. These substrates are currently mechanically thinned to minimize the negative impact of this increased thickness on performance and form-factor. There are significant challenges to continue this trend and the thin crystalline technology and device architecture proposed here can enable continued scaling of device metrics over the next decade with favorable cost structures.  During phase I, functional power MOSFETs were demonstrated with this thin crystalline technology to establish the feasibility of this technology for power devices. This phase II effort will focus on the following specific technical challenges to bring it to market. (1) Develop power MOSFETs with improved switching characteristics using the thin crystalline technology (2) High voltage high current characterization of the thin crystalline power MOSFETs (3) Process yield and reliability characterization of package thin crystalline power MOSFET parts and (4) Convert existing process line to use thin crystalline exfoliation technology in high volume manufacturing flow.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project aims to develop a sensor with the ability to provide an accurate, small, cost-effective, and low-power device for the detection and quantification of natural gas. The current U.S. industrial natural gas leak detector market is estimated to be $325 million, while the residential natural gas detector market exceeds $2 billion, both of which indicate the strong market potential of this technology. Phage-based colorimetric sensing is a new sensing mechanism, and has the potential to replace and improve detection across many applications. This project, if successful, will have a number of broader impacts.  Firstly, 670 billion cubic feet (cf) of methane is leaked annually in the U.S. natural gas industry. Better monitoring and recapturing of the lost gas will result in less reliance on imported gas (3 trillion cf in 2015), thus stimulating economic growth and reducing waste.  Additionally, a new type of sensor that provides accurate, compact, inexpensive, and power-efficient natural gas monitoring with wireless communication capabilities will enable large scale natural gas emission monitoring studies, providing a tool for scientists and regulators.  Finally, a reduction of methane emissions will help combat climate change, as methane is a powerful greenhouse gas.

    During the Phase I project, we have successfully fabricated colorimetric thin-film sensors, developed a data analysis algorithm, and shown our sensors are both consistent and selective against individual components of natural gas at industrially-suitable sensitivity. In Phase II, we will further improve the production and performance of the phage sensors. There are six objectives in this Phase II project. The first is to do sensor calibration using precise gas calibration instrumentation to improve sensor accuracy. Secondly, the sensors will undergo environmental stress testing to evaluate longevity. Third, a scale-up feasibility study will be undertaken to determine and optimize sensor cost. The fourth task involves the development of improved and more inexpensive sensor designs, while the fifth task will optimize the production process of the new sensor. The sixth objective involves a more comprehensive characterization of the sensor.  It is anticipated that by the end of Phase II, we will have a precisely- calibrated gas sensor with data recognition algorithms, and an established and scalable manufacturing model, resulting in an improved colorimetric sensor development kit for natural gas that better meets customer needs in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project includes tremendous commercial potential, societal benefits, and scientific advances. Conventional superabsorbent polymers (SAP) are based on polyacrylates or polyacrylamides derived from petroleum feedstock. They are widely used in the absorbent cores of hygiene products, with disposable diapers representing approximately 85% of the global SAP market of $6B. Increasing consumer and supply chain demand for more natural, sustainable materials and products has driven the development of eco-friendly / natural labeled absorbent hygiene products (AHP). Eco-friendly diaper products currently make up about 3% of the global market and are experiencing strong growth at 10-15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This project will lead to the commercialization of a low-cost high-performance biobased SAP, offering significant environmental benefits as a more sustainable, eco-friendly alternative to petrobased SAP. This project could also generate positive economic impacts on domestic agriculture by creating new demand for bio-feedstocks such as waste glycerol. Finally, this project advances the scientific and technological state-of-the-art by developing a new bioprocess based on microbial co-cultures that could be extended to render more efficient, cost-effective routes for producing other biobased fuels and chemicals.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a new biological route, based on microbial co-cultures, for cost-effective production of gamma-polyglutamic acid (PGA) and to commercialize cross-linked PGA SAP for AHP applications. In Phase I of this project, a microbial co-culture process was developed for efficient production of PGA via in-situ precursor production (ISPP) from low-cost bio-feedstocks. materials. Building on promising results in Phase I, further R&D will aim to reach pilot-scale production by the end of Phase II. Three specific technical objectives will be pursued: Objective 1: Strain engineering and bioprocess optimization to develop an ISPP fermentation process with commercially viable performance metrics. Objective 2: Optimization of downstream purification, SAP cross-linking, and finishing to produce a high performance finished PGA SAP product. Objective 3: Pilot-scale process demonstration to produce commercial quantities of PGA SAP for large scale customer/partner trials. This R&D plan will lead to transformative technological outcomes. The proposed process based on microbial co-cultures represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm of utilizing single-species monocultures for bioprocessing and offers substantial cost-savings. The engineering and process development strategies developed during this project will be transferrable for a broad range of other co-culture bioprocessing applications.

    This Phase II project aims to help address the achievement gap for English Learners, who consistently average 21% below native English speakers on reading scale scores starting in 4th grade and are twice as likely to drop out of school. Eighty percent of teachers believe that materials for English Learners are sub-standard, which contributes to this gap. The project provides an online crowd-authoring and sharing platform that gives K-6 language teachers the tools to meet their unique instructional needs on demand. It is the first and only platform to enable practicing teachers to rapidly build digital language lessons and interactive games that align to their specific requirements, without any technical know-how. The platform provides built-in rich media resources that adhere to best practices based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. Any teacher may access these open educational resources at no cost, provided they make their own creations available for public reuse, revision and remixing. The project seeks to understand the dynamics of collaboration and quality assurance for interactive content at a massive scale. Crowd-authoring can invest educators with the power to transform language learning into a field that is highly responsive to the evolving needs of educators and learners.

    This Phase II project will pioneer mass customization of interactive games and media in the field of second language acquisition. The project aims for teachers to create 175,000 custom digital lessons and interactive games using media resources provided by the project. Phase II will develop four new types of games that improve language acquisition using audiovisual experimentation, realtime chat with artificial intelligences, and a new technology that transforms visuals and narratives composed by students into grammatically accurate text and audio. Phase II will integrate these innovations into a crowd-authoring and quality assurance system capable of scaling to 100,000 new teacher-made learning objects per month. By giving language educators tools to rapidly create, share and customize content to meet their precise needs, the project seeks to significantly improve learning outcomes. Phase II will implement real-time formative assessment reports for teachers to evaluate student experiences and issues with the custom teacher-made interactive content. A controlled full-year, multi-site educational impact study will measure whether the project affects vocabulary acquisition, comprehension, grammar and sentence formation, and whether any skill gains transfer to other contexts. It will also reveal deep data insights about the process by which K-6 students acquire a second language.

    This Phase II project proposes to develop a computer science (CS) educational software that has the potential to inspire millions of U.S. K-12 students to learn computer programming.  This software will leverage the motivational power of a popular video game, to teach CS to students by teaching them to reprogram the video game itself.  The United States currently has a severe deficit of students pursuing CS.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that over 1 million computing job openings will go unfilled by U.S. workers by 2022.  By leveraging the power of a popular video game, the technology proposed in this Phase II project has the potential to expose millions of K-12 students to coding in the next 5 years.  The commercial impact of the underlying technology developed in this Phase II project does not stop at the over 100 million users who currently play the popular video game with which the current educational software integrates.  Because the underlying technology is transferable to any moddable (i.e. reprogrammable) video game, the technology has the potential to be used to teach CS with other popular titles from the rapidly growing video game industry.

    This Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a software product that is a web-based coding environment for novice programmers.  This software goes beyond the state-of-the-art technologies in this space (i.e., scratch.mit.edu) in several ways: 1) It uses automated tutoring techniques to customize the educational experiences for novices, 2) it facilitates writing programs that manipulate objects and terrain in a 3D environment, 3) it allows the novice user to reprogram a popular video game, 4) it has an in-browser, WebGL-based 3D runtime environment, 5) it supports both a novice-friendly visual programming language (Blockly) as well as a text-based language (JavaScript), 6) it leverages gamification techniques such as badges, points, and unlockable items, and 7) it supports multi-user, collaborative coding.  The objectives of this Phase II project concentrate on improving student experiences in order to increase customer retention and acquisition and to finish the development of a marketable product that will teach 5 million K-12 students in the next 5 years.  The first objective of this project involves developing and extending the browser-embedded game engine.  The second objective focuses on improving systems that match students with appropriate educational content and motivate students to continue learning.  Finally, the third objective involves implementing new systems that incentivize students to create and share with the community.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve our ability to fight infectious diseases that negatively impact agricultural yields and reduce the efficiency of global food production and distribution systems. This innovation will enhance scientific and technological understanding by leveraging the power of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to provide a pathogen identification and surveillance tool with demonstrated efficacy against known and unknown infectious agents. This platform is fast, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used for any animal sample to detect virtually all possible microbes even microbes that have never before been characterized. Hundreds of samples can be rapidly screened without relying upon known genetic/genomic data of microbes. The global molecular diagnostics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 14% from 2012 to 2017, with infectious disease testing being the leading application at 26% share, therefore the commercial opportunity of this project is vast.

    The proposed project follows up on the validation of the diagnostic platform (SBIR Phase I) and delves deeper into improving virus detection and genetic data generation. In addition, this proposal seeks to develop a basal informatics infrastructure that together with sample preparation improvements will be conducive of scalable, high-throughput analysis of several samples. Current diagnostic methods rely on what is already known about target microbe genetics, and provide limited information in the form of presence/absence of a known target sequence. The SBIR Phase I was instrumental to lowering the technical risks associated with a high-throughput unbiased pathogen detection platform based on DNA sequencing and Bayesian statistics. In the pursue of standardizing and validating our metagenomics pathogen identification platform, this project proposes to: 1) improve viral detection capabilities and accuracy, 2) develop new functionalities, and 3) incorporate Phase I and Phase II advances into an integrated in-house web-accessible interface.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a platform to rapidly design synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals, which will replace environmentally harmful,
    ecologically inefficient industrial chemical processes. The technology developed
    in this proposal will provide a competitive edge in the rapid engineering of synthetic
    organisms to produce biochemicals by fermentation that are currently produced
    from oil (reducing our CO2 emissions) or extracted from natural species (reducing
    our taxing load on existing ecosystems). This technology also has the potential
    to be used for the manufacture of drugs, and to engineer novel organisms to improve
    crop production and therefore help address the mounting challenges of providing
    food to a growing world population without tapping too much in Earth's resources.
    Commercially, the chemicals that will be enabled by application of the technology
    developed during the Phase I program open up billion dollar markets that are currently
    inaccessible to the chemical industry. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes
    to develop a platform that combines computational enzyme design with systems biology
    to create a fully integrated system for the design and testing of novel cell factories
    for the production of bulk and fine chemicals. During the Phase I project, the
    company, in collaboration with the University of Washington, has successfully
    developed a high-performance software code to rapidly design novel metabolic pathways
    to produce any target chemical from central metabolism. In Phase II, the company
    will further advance the concept by (1) developing a high-performance pathway
    prioritization module to estimate each designed pathway yield and impact on organism
    metabolism in the context of whole-genome models and (2) use the software platform
    to design libraries of pathways for the production of a variety of specialty chemical
    targets that are commercially valuable and not known to be produced by fermentation
    at scale. Then, (3) using an experimental screening setup, the DNA for all the
    proposed pathways will be assembled screened at high-throughput for detectable
    production of the target chemicals."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the potential to directly and positively impact the speed of chemical analysis leading to cleaner and more advanced products. Technology resulting from the proposed activity will solve several pain points in the chemical analysis industry, including non-linearity, small dynamic range and variable, sometimes negligible, detector response. As a result, the technology will have broad use and lead to improved detection in pharmaceuticals, drug development, fuels, chemicals, renewables, foods, flavors, and academic and industrial research. Uniform response to carbon from flame ionization detection (FID) would be completely disruptive to the painstaking methods of calibration of known compounds and the guesswork associated with the quantification of unknowns. The benefits of this technology are expected to result in immense improvements in the speed and accuracy of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, thereby leading to better and safer products, with faster development times. Applied to the pharmaceutical and new drug development industry, this technology will have lasting impacts on the health and safety of society due to better and faster analyses available.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to deliver a carbon selective detector (CSD) to the global scientific market.  The CSD is a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)  detector that produces a linear response to all organic compounds using a flame ionization detection (FID)  and a catalytic reactor. The key innovation is the novel development and use of a catalytic reactor to transform organic molecules and remove solvent in liquid chromatograph effluent streams. The FID, similar to those ubiquitous in gas chromatography (GC) systems, yields a universal response to organic compounds converted to methane with unparalleled linear range and robustness. The device will overcome limitations of the FID that have prevented previous use in HPLC by selectively removing solvents, oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide, reducing carbon dioxide to methane, and detecting the resulting methane with the FID.  The resulting product features, most notably a universal response to carbon, will provide pre-clinical pharmaceutical researchers with a tool that can quantify drugs and their by-products during screening, long before the process has been scaled up for the production of calibration standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a fast, efficient, and scalable cell engineering technology that is easily automated through integration with liquid handling robots.  Currently, there is a bottleneck in the process of cell engineering, especially in the engineering of cells for discovery of new therapeutics.  The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.  Applications of cell engineering technology range from fundamental research in cell physiology to the discovery of new targets for cellular therapies.  The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array. In this project, these systems will be integrated with the cell engineering devices and automated liquid handling robot. Third, the integrated system will be used to generate a large library of primary human T cell variants as proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential for high-throughput cell engineering for therapeutic target discovery.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the fact that it builds on the trend to make IT infrastructure consumable as a service and unlocks this potential for network functions. In deploying the Stateless Network Functions as a Service solution, cloud providers, enterprises, and internet service providers are able to launch network functions, such as firewalls and load balancers, on demand, and the Stateless platform automates the management of these functions.  With cloud traffic expected to quadruple over the next several years (according to Cisco), a rapid growth in number of devices (with the Internet of Things emerging), and an ever-increasing complexity and scale of security threats, this project will provide operators with the agility to quickly and easily deploy infrastructure to keep up with these trends and threats.  In doing so, society will experience more reliable networked applications with reduced data breaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project provides the research and development needed to realize the vision of a network function operating system.  Whereas the Phase I project established technical feasibility by demonstrating the technology that decouples network functions state from processing can be turned into a product and integrated into a production environment, the Phase II project will approach three new research directions that will support a complete platform.  (i) Network service chaining:  While not a new concept, it is one that has proven to be challenging with virtual appliances.  This project will add support to the Stateless platform to connect network functions into chains, elastically scale chains, and provide quality of service of the whole chain.  (ii) Observability:  This project will introduce the ability to abstract away the details when appropriate or peel away the layers of abstraction as needed, providing operators with a simple solution they have full control over.  (iii) Software development kit:  This project will introduce both the application programming interfaces as well as the isolation mechanisms to allow third parties, whether other vendors or data center operators, to introduce new network functionality based on the Stateless platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves addressing complexities in fluid management, one of the most important issues in critical care. Suboptimal fluid management results in many complications such as pulmonary edema. Studies show that fluid overload is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies also show that restrictive fluid resuscitation protocols result in a reduction of mechanical ventilation days and hospital length of stay. The clinical literature provides ample evidence of optimized fluid therapy benefits for different patient populations including those with sepsis and post-operative patients. However, implementation of fluid therapy is highly subjective. Specifically, the most critical unanswered questions involve the timing and the volume of fluid infusions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop a system which uses continuous measurements from a standard intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring device to provide actionable feedback for clinicians to optimize fluid and vasoactive drug management. In the proposed Phase II work, we will further develop the clinical decision support system developed in Phase I. This includes further development of the underlying technology and also performing preliminary clinical studies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable mobile robots to coexist harmoniously with people in their homes and offices. The market for consumer and office robots is projected to grow 17% annually, seven times faster than the market for manufacturing robots, reaching $1.5B by 2019. An important step toward market growth is creating autonomous robots that are unobtrusive, intelligent, and highly agile. Accomplishing this requires robots to be small enough to stay out of the way and fast enough to elegantly avoid humans and environmental obstacles. Inappropriate noise levels and safety concerns make it unlikely that airborne vehicles will be prevalent in indoor environments, whereas wheeled mobile robots can achieve near-silent operation. Tiny, fast robots are unobtrusive enough to use as a low-cost surveillance tool in home or office security, and portable enough for covertly investigating hostile situations. People with severe disabilities could travel vicariously by combining a virtual reality headset with a telepresence robot.
    Fast maneuvering robots could be used as a compelling educational or entertainment platform for kids and adults.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate the Phase I feasibility work on multi-surface aggressive maneuvering for small robots into a consumer-affordable hardware platform suitable for commercialization. In addition to developing a miniaturized robotic platform, this project will also address challenges outside the scope of Phase I related to home-scale autonomous navigation to locations of interest, which can be fixed (such as a room) or dynamic (such as the location of a pet). Such challenges
    include multi-room mapping, planning, path execution, and high-speed obstacle avoidance. This project will also develop fail-safe reactive techniques for navigation in situations where a model of the environment is either incorrect or altogether unavailable. Four key Phase II objectives will address these challenges: 1) multi-room surface-aware maneuvering with vision-based localization, 2) efficient maneuvering in the presence of obstacles and clutter, 3) map initialization for monitoring places of interest, and 4) development of the final hardware platform.

    This SBIR Phase I project will produce an innovative reading application and administrative portal to support science learning. Although the science textbook is a central curricular resource, this resource is often inaccessible and difficult to read. Science textbooks are syntactically (grammatically) and semantically (word meaning) complex. Specifically, elementary and secondary science texts are often written 3 to 5 years beyond what is developmentally appropriate. Because of these complexities, science textbooks often overwhelm students' working memory, preventing them from constructing accurate mental representations of the target concepts. Thus, this project will develop and test a multiplatform, personalizable e-reader with embedded reading and language support. The intellectual merit of the effort resides in its ability to improve science comprehension through personalized and adaptive content. This project will produce content and assessments targeting the Next Generation Science Standards associated with Earth and Space Science. The customizable features will make fundamental science knowledge more accessible and interesting to students -- and thus the Public. Given these benefits, it has strong potential to support future generations of STEM professionals and a more scientifically literate citizenry.


    This project will produce a multiplatform reading application to support science learning. The key innovation will be to make science content adaptable and adjustable for learners. This Phase II project has five technical goals: (a) develop and test the e-reader to work via tablet and mobile web; (b) develop and test enhanced reading features; (c) develop and test administrative and payment portals; (d) develop and curate NGSS-aligned content and assessments; (e) conduct user testing with students and teachers. During Phase II, the project team will address some technological challenges in bringing this innovation to market. The key features of the interactive reading application create a potential for unnecessary memory load. This technological challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to be highly preprocessed and modular. A second challenge is providing secure access to multi-tiered users. This technical challenge will be overcome by architecting the program to allow for secure, multiple group membership, ensuring data visibility and security. A diverse SquidBooks team, with expertise in business, software design and engineering, educational research and measurement, science education, writing, and science will achieve these goals of this Phase II project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be in helping batteries exceed the quality, performance, and safety demands of mass-market electric vehicles, renewable energy generation, and next-generation consumer electronic devices. The need for high-performance batteries is accelerating, and as batteries grow in energy density, size, and production volumes, so will the issues that persist with quality. Unless these issues are addressed, they will continue to have major implications for the performance, safety, and adoption of these important technologies. The challenge is that outside of R&D labs, the industry relies on essentially the same basic data as when batteries were first invented: voltage, current, and temperature. As a result, at commercial scales, only a small percentage of batteries are inspected in a meaningful way, with methods that only provide indirect information about physical condition. This Phase 2 project is focused on developing a new platform for production-level battery inspection that directly probes the physical condition of batteries with a high testing throughput. This could lead to better decisions in manufacturing environments and could decrease system costs, increase capacity and operational lifetime, and accelerate the scale-up of promising new materials.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses the need for a physical mode of inspection in battery production environments that is capable of screening every cell with high fidelity. Currently, inspection in production-level environments are limited to electrical measurements and X-rays. Electrical methods provide only indirect and cell-averaged information about physical condition, and X-rays are not practically able to detect the distribution of electrolyte within batteries nor the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer (both of which strongly affect long-term reliability, performance, and safety of batteries). This Phase 2 project aims to develop a platform that utilizes sound-based methods to inspect batteries in production-environments. This will involve developing a scaled, automated hardware system as well as software and computational methods for processing and analyzing the acoustic signals. The Phase 2 project will also include various testing and validation efforts to assess the ability of acoustic analysis to both directly determine the performance quality and reliability of cells beyond beginning of life capacity and resistance, as well as to improve the performance of strings of cells and modules.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is provided by a novel data processing architecture, utilizing high-parallel in-memory computing for certain recurring and data intensive functions. Traditional computer architecture funnels all data through the central processing unit (CPU). Multiple CPU cores and very high clock frequencies are used to address the issue of ever increasing demands on data processing capability. However, the transportation capacity of data between memory and CPU cores has become a limiting factor creating a 'memory bottleneck'. This limitation is most noticeable in the recent and rapid development of artificial intelligence applications which deploy so called neuromorphic computing techniques, which in turn require a very high parallelism in computation and proportional demands on memory bandwidth. This project performs key repetitive operations within the memory itself, leveraging the inherent parallelism of the memory architecture, thereby avoiding a large percentage of the data transport otherwise required. The resulting elimination of the memory bottleneck provides a path forward for high complexity neuromorphic computing applications such as autonomous navigation used for self-driving cars. Reduced demands on data transport and CPU also significantly reduce power consumption, enabling a wide variety of mobile artificial intelligence applications.

    The proposed project investigates the system level integration challenges of a memory-centric neuromorphic computing approach, and aims to demonstrate a seamless integration with existing software platforms currently using traditional neuromorphic computing processors. It is important for a novel hardware platform to be compatible with existing software in order to lower barriers to market entry. This Phase II project also develops the actual semiconductor product which has been investigated in Phase I as a feasibility demonstrator. The Phase II product is based on a non-volatile high density memory architecture, and as such is expected to provide the full capability in terms of both power and operations per second. Once the hardware is available in the second half of the project, these key parameters will be thoroughly characterized and benchmarked against the current state of the art technology. A projection will be made outlining the future scaling potential using ultra high density volatile and non-volatile memory geared towards high complexity neuromorphic computing beyond what is currently possible using existing approaches.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop a novel low-cost molecular filter for use in harsh environments. This is accomplished using commodity silica gel, commonly found as a desiccant in food packing, whose pores can be made to be only a few molecules wide. Accurate tuning of the size and shape of the silica gel pores enables certain molecules to pass through while others are blocked from passing. One promising application for these molecular filters is their use in grid-scale energy storage. Flow batteries could store city-sized quantities of renewable energy. However, they require the use of expensive molecular filters that are not easily replaced due to the harsh battery environments. The low-cost filters developed during this SBIR Phase II project have the potential to reduce the cost of flow batteries by as much as 15%, making them less expensive than grid-scale lithium ion batteries. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid. Low cost molecular filter also has commercial upside with the potential to capture a significant fraction of the $2.7 billion-dollar market. Because of this, this project could generate nearly 15 jobs and $39 million dollars in tax revenue over the next 5 years.


    This SBIR Phase II Project is developing a molecularly selective sol-gel ceramic membrane that does not require calcination or high polymer loading but also does not fracture during compression in stack applications (e.g., fuel cells and flow batteries). This is accomplished by decoupling the selective region from the region of the membrane being compressed by the stack. These membranes will be utilized to improve the performance and reduce the costs of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB). VRFB membranes require selective transport of hydronium ions but not vanadium ions. Size and charge exclusion membranes must therefore have tight control over the pore size, shape and network structure to selectively transport ions. Towards this end, sol-gel processing and surface charge modification will be utilized to maximize proton conductivity and limit vanadium ion permeability. Optimized membrane formulations must also have excellent chemical and mechanical stability; showing no degradation after hundreds of VRFB cycles. Finally, membranes must be scaled from lab size (50 cm2) to commercial size (> 500cm2) while maintaining performance uniformity. The low-cost membranes developed during this SBIR Phase I project have the potential to reduce the cost of VRFBs by as much as 15%. Lower cost grid-scale storage means that more renewable energy generation (e.g., solar & wind) can be added without overwhelming the grid.

    This SBIR Phase II project will expand on Phase I R&D work to build, test, and optimize a web-based software system for the classroom setting to complement the digital library app for home use developed in Phase I. This cost-effective system will further promote adult-mediated dialogic reading routines with children 0-7 years in age. Early exposure to dialogic reading has been shown to foster virtually all school and reading-readiness indicators - from cognitive and social-emotional development to vocabulary attainment and concepts about print. The new system also introduces foundational science knowledge and habits, such as the capacity to observe, experiment, and problem solve. The ever-widening education attainment and opportunity gaps between rich and poor result in diminished human potential and citizens unequipped for the demands of an information-based labor market. Investments in early childhood can prevent educational deficits, so a cost-effective system that coaches adults to engage children in a dialogic reading process can make a substantial contribution to ending school-readiness gaps - the precursor to persistent achievement gaps - and the cycle of economic and societal disadvantages they perpetuate. This project also addresses the urgent need to bolster the teaching of higher-order thinking skills by early education teachers. The market for early-education digital products is sizable and growing. Purchasers in this market are K-3 schools, preschools, Head Start, social- service agencies, and libraries, as well as individual families.


    This project will build the technical capacity to augment and measure the growth of adult-led dialogic reading with children 0-7 years in age. The systems architecture and proprietary algorithms will produce a system that increases adult capacity for dialogic questioning and exploration by using the copyrighted, text-specific guidance embedded in the library. Metrics, children's work product, and online adult-learning modules aim to incentivize and build teacher/caregiver confidence, inform school leaders, and focus them on continued application of the dialogic process to other books and subjects. Augmentations to the content management system developed in Phase I will enable the sales, distribution, management, and evaluation of all product form factors. The secure data-sharing portal and dashboard built through this project will allow institutional clients to monitor and evaluate their programs. R&D will include collection of engagement metrics, including usage data (access to which is built into the digital library) and online surveys. The core innovation to be studied is whether this product enables adults of varying educational backgrounds to practice an intellectually ambitious reading and thinking method with their children.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pilot field test controlled release polymers (CRPs) as an in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation material. With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application. CRPs are a novel technology, offering a highly tunable remediation amendment for the $1.4B Chemical Treatment Remediation Market. Ultimately, CRPs based treatments will decrease exposure to groundwater contaminants known to cause many human health disorders.

    The technical objectives in this Phase II research project will be to field test CRPs patented, controlled release polymer technology for in situ chemical oxidation of contaminated groundwater.  To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.

    This SBIR Phase II project seeks to develop an internet-of-things (IoT) data collection and analysis platform for collaborative STEM and big data research and education, that enables collaborative, geographically dispersed collection of data from internet enabled scientific instruments. STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) jobs are on the rise: the U.S. Department of Commerce predicts that occupations in these sectors will grow by 8.9 % from 2014 to 2024. Yet the U.S. currently faces a critical shortage of workers and students who are proficient in math and science subjects. In part, this shortage is due to a lack of interest in STEM-related fields by minorities and women. Engaging, relevant and hands on experiences are needed to encourage interest amongst these populations. This project fulfills the requests of the federal government and leading-edge STEM educators that both secondary and post-secondary institutions teach science in a way that engages students with real-world problems. The expectation is that this project will make big data accessible, while providing rewarding and appealing hands-on learning opportunities that will increase data literacy; increase scientific collaboration in education across geographic and interdisciplinary lines; and increase scientific literacy and interest across demographics, thus increasing the likelihood that students will continue to pursue scientific careers.

    The proposed technology will be the first collaborative educational IoT STEM platform to be developed, and is innovative in the field of Educational Technology, which has yet to adopt web-connected sensors that generate big data on a global scale. At present, there is no mechanism for schools to collect and share real data between classrooms and schools in an organized way. The proposed innovation allows users to communicate via a global network and is capable of being paired with an unlimited variety of scientific instruments and data sources, to support versatile, engaging, coordinated, multi-school experiments and data sharing. Data science now impacts virtually every profession in some way, and the platform will uniquely expose students to big data analytics in an engaging and relevant way. In Phase 1, feasibility of approach was firmly established. Phase II objectives will be to expand the educational platform developed in Phase I to optimize national/global impact and support applicability to big data research as well as a range of sensors. Goals include to expand tools to view and analyze data, refine and expand curriculum, develop an Application Programming Interface and create software tools to manipulate and share data/curriculum. The platform's ability to promote greater learning will also be evaluated.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of high application temperature materials available for additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, provides increased design freedom and complex features such as part consolidation and conformal cooling channels. The performance and efficiency of gas turbines and other applications can be increased by combining design improvements enabled by additive manufacturing with a suitable high temperature material. Unfortunately, existing materials either do not have sufficient high temperature performance or are not compatible with high quality printing methods. This project will develop new nickel superalloy composite additive manufacturing materials for use with high temperature gas turbine components. Successful completion of this project will result in more efficient turbines to reduce energy costs, transportation costs, and carbon emissions. The manufacturing, power generation, and aerospace industries are expected to be impacted from this project. In addition, history has demonstrated that new materials and manufacturing technologies often lead to additional unexpected innovations. This project will help the country lead in the innovation of high performance materials technology to address the needs of the $86 billion gas turbine market and to grow advanced manufacturing jobs in the US.



    This project will utilize innovative reactive additive manufacturing materials technology to develop 3D printable advanced high temperature superalloys. During additive fabrication, high melting temperature product phases will be synthesized in-situ within a superalloy matrix to significantly improve high temperature performance and improve printability. This innovative reactive additive manufacturing technology has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of materials systems including nickel superalloys in an NSF Phase I project. Metal matrix composites produced using this technology have demonstrated greatly increased strength, wear resistance, and high temperature performance relative to comparable traditional alloys. In addition, this technology has demonstrated the ability to eliminate micro and macro cracking problems with alloys that had previously been considered unprintable. This project aims to further develop one or more high temperature superalloys compatible with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing for use in the hot sections of gas turbines. The scope of the project includes theoretical and experimental development and evaluation of novel material feedstocks, additive manufacturing processing conditions, and heat treatments. Evaluation of printed components will include measurement of density, hardness, standard and high temperature tensile properties, creep, and microstructure and phase analysis. Turbine components will be additively fabricated for pilot studies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to provide an affordable sealant for sealing joints and cracks in cement concrete pavement, asphalt concrete pavement, bridge deck, etc. In transportation infrastructure, joints are intentionally constructed in order to allow movement of the structural elements due to linear thermal expansion/contraction when temperature rises/drops. Cracks are a common failure mode in pavement, and if not properly sealed, can cause water damage and rupture of the concrete. Sealing cracks and joints is a common practice to maintain or extend the service life of structural elements. Various types of sealants are currently used with an annual market value of about $6.1 billion. Unfortunately, many of these sealants fail to work properly and are ineffective in extending service life. In this project, a smart sealant will be developed that expands upon cooling and contracts upon heating, a thermal characteristic opposite to that of concrete. The product will address a significant problem in the industry arising from thermal movement of joined/cracked structural elements. It is expected that the product will have about 0.8% market share in 5 years helping with the need for longer lasting and more reliable infrastructure.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in the development and validation of a smart sealant technology. The root cause for joint failure is that the thermal expansion characteristics of most sealants is similar to that of concrete, i.e., contraction upon cooling and expansion upon heating. This behavior is contrary to what is required of sealants in order to avoid thermally induced separation between the sealant and the concrete. Unfortunately, few materials can fulfill this requirement in a cost effective way while maintaining other desired physical properties (such as, deformability). This Phase II project will solve the century-long problem through the use of a two-way shape memory polymer (2W-SMP) based sealant that addresses the root cause. Building upon the feasibility study of the Phase I project, the Phase II project will focus on further improving the 2W-SMP based sealant for sealing joints or cracks in pavement, and validate the product through third-party lab-scale testing, and full-scale field-level verification in both hot and humid environment and extremely cold regions. Technical outcome will include lab-scale validation, field level performance and verification, and construction protocols for this new smart material, laying a solid foundation for adoption by home owners and transportation agencies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate compatibility of a novel polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composite coating with metal-polymer bearings currently on the market, scale up the coating deposition process, and implement pilot processing lines. Currently, there is a need for a method to improve adhesion at the PTFE/metal interface while also reducing corrosion, friction, and wear. The implementation of this technology will aid in the transition from traditional lubricants to solid lubricants in manufacturing and has significant implications for the US economy and the environment. Currently, annual lubrication-related maintenance costs are as high as $1 trillion, and consumption of petroleum-based lubricants is estimated to reach 43.78 million metric tons as of 2016. The effective implementation of this technology will reduce maintenance costs and downtime by eliminating premature bearing failure. This project will serve as a proof point for the adoption of nano-coating technologies for reducing friction and wear in mechanical systems. It will also reduce barriers to entry for these coatings in industries dominated by outdated lubrication practices. The total applicable market size for metal-polymer bearings is estimated to be $1.0 billion, and a substantial near-term revenue opportunity for the proposed technology in this sector will be the focus of this effort. This beachhead opportunity serves as an industry validation point for the proposed technology and an entry point to other industrial and manufacturing applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project is based on improving the adhesion and mechanical properties of PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings using an adhesive biomimetic polymer. This technology increases the wear-life of PTFE coatings, allowing for applications from which they have historically been precluded due to high wear and delamination. During Phase I, the proof of concept was established through demonstration of strong adhesion, 40% reduction in friction, 80% reduction in wear and elimination of susceptibility to corrosion in current metal-polymer bearings. The focus of Phase II will be in tailoring the coatings for specific product applications and implementation. The proposed SBIR Phase II work will overcome the remaining technical hurdles and validate the use of this technology as both a solution for improving the adhesion between PTFE and substrates and as a replacement for current PTFE liners in metal-polymer bearings. The execution of this project will allow the realization of critical proof points needed by industrial partners and speed the adoption of this technology into product lines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the development of new carbon dioxide utilization technology for the commercialization of onsite gas production. The impediment to electrochemical carbon dioxide utilization technology has been the lack of an electrolyzer design capable of high production rates and high energy efficiency. This project will yield a novel electrolyzer component to overcome these challenges and demonstrate that cost-effective carbon dioxide utilization is possible. This component can be integrated into existing electrolyzer designs, and will enable such hardware to convert carbon dioxide into specialty gases. The resulting solution will have higher safety and lower cost than conventional packaged gas. Long term, this technology could be scaled up to higher volume applications, and used as a means of converting industrial carbon dioxide emissions into useful chemicals and fuels, thereby transforming a waste product into a new revenue stream. This scalable technology could therefore be the basis for the creation of new economic value and advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, while providing a profitable way for existing U.S. industries to reduce their emissions.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will build upon the promising feasibility results achieved in Phase I to increase the performance of a novel carbon dioxide electrochemical cell along key performance dimensions, in order to deliver a commercially-relevant, cost-competitive solution. A viable solution to derive specialty gases from a low-cost feedstock like carbon dioxide will need to have high performance on several dimensions: energy efficiency, high reaction rates, long lifetime, and low capital cost. It will also need to operate at a scale that is industrially relevant. In Phase II, the novel electrochemical component will be scaled up to commercial dimensions, and the performance of the component will be optimized to meet the performance requirements identified during customer interviews. The final component will form the basis for a commercial unit, capable of producing specialty gases from carbon dioxide at cost-competitive rates. It will lay the foundation for future scale-up to even larger membrane areas, which will enable industrial-scale applications of this carbon dioxide conversion technology. Carbon dioxide emissions could be converted into valuable products using this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enhance infrastructure for research and education by exposing a previously unavailable dataset: fine-grained human interaction with a physical environment. Humans are always building on and shaping the world but there is little hard data to further examine the effects this has. Beyond retail, this technology could affect how teachers layout classrooms, how disaster workers provide relief, or how factories keep their workers safe. The subtle physical details that affect humans everyday will be understood and investigated in ways not possible without the proposed system. This technology will benefit society by increasing economic efficiency because retailers can meet customer needs more easily. This translates into large potential commercial value because of the size of the retail market and because retailers are under pressure to deliver differentiated customer experiences that customers cannot get online or at big-box stores. Such experiences are enabled by understanding the customer at a much deeper level which in turn is enabled by the technology proposed here.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses sensor placement models, statistical methods, and face recognition to fully realize the commercial potential resulting from the Phase I development of a video analytics system for understanding human behavior. Research in video-based behavior recognition has seen renewed excitement because of deep learning but current work only addresses pieces of the problem. Critical missing components are robust face identification and registration, a process to install as few cameras as possible while maximizing the viewable area of a store, and video analysis results that are meaningful when combined with other data such as retail transactions. The research objectives of extracting biometric data (such as facial features) from video, automatically computing the optimal positions of cameras, and correlating behavior metrics with business operations are essential to improve the retail experience for shoppers and make the developments undertaken in Phase I more commercially relevant to potential end users of the technology.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project enables
    the development of the next generation of contact lenses for vision correction
    based on a novel photomodification technique called \"LIRIC (Laser Induced Refractive
    Index Change).\" More than 2.3 billion people world-wide suffer from refractive
    error in their visual system, while over 500 million have inadequate access to
    refractive correction. Glasses are an option for refractive correction, however
    there can be practical limitations and even social stigma associated with wearing
    glasses, particularly among adolescents. Meanwhile vision correction with contact
    lenses is limited to lenses whose optical prescription is determined by their
    thickness profile. This has negative consequences for visual quality, on-eye stability
    and corneal health. The research represents a fundamental shift in how vision
    correction is applied because it alters the refractive index of an optical material,
    enabling previously unavailable visual correctors in thin, stable contact lenses.
    LIRIC uses a high repetition rate, femtosecond laser to micro-modify the local
    medium to produce custom refractive corrections in hydrogels, and in living cornea.
    LIRIC works by accumulating localized refractive index (RI) changes in an ocular
    material to create a refractive lateral gradient index lens. \n\nChanging the
    refractive index using LIRIC instead of the surface shape can lead to several
    fundamental advances for vision correction, with profound implications for vision
    care: 1) contact lenses can be manufactured specifically for patient fit and stability
    with the refractive correction decoupled from the lens shape; 2) difficult and
    irregular refractive corrections (i.e. for irregular astigmatism, presbyopia,
    and higher order aberrations) could be written more easily and with better spatial
    resolution than with existing methods; 3) multifocal and diffractive optical designs
    can be utilized for presbyopic and macular degenerative corrections. Patients
    viewing through LIRIC lenses, created in Phase I, had visual performance (visual
    acuity and contrast sensitivity) on par with a control lens. The objective of
    the Phase II work is to demonstrate that LIRIC works in contact lenses at process
    speeds necessary for commercial manufacturing. The goal of this work is to demonstrate
    that a 6.5 mm optical zone can be successfully processed in <15 seconds. To effectively
    do so, the LIRIC process has to achieve more than 1 wave of phase change (at 555
    nm wavelength) at laser scanning velocities in excess of 10 meter/second."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel algorithms for electrodynamic simulations in commercial clouds. Electrodynamic simulation is essential for computational prototyping in optical and radio-frequency devices. Current commercial solutions require significant upfront investment of both software and hardware. They also suffer from low productivity due to limited in-house computing resources. This project will develop a cloud-based simulation service which will provide on-demand, pay-per-use, virtually unlimited simulation capability without requiring users to purchase any hardware or software. This simulation technology will greatly improve productivity, reduce the barrier to entry, and minimize cost in the design of optical and radio-frequency applications. Moreover, it will serve multiple scientific and engineering disciplines and will facilitate the use of high-performance simulation in all phases of scientific discovery and engineering design. It will revolutionize large-scale scientific simulation and allow anyone with internet access to gain unprecedented simulation power. Ultimately, this technology will help accelerate research and development in the health, energy, and defense industries by offering intuitive, on-demand, and practically infinitely scalable scientific software to engineers and scientists at a price-point significantly lower than any other cloud computing service.

    There is currently no electromagnetic simulation software which performs efficiently in commercial clouds, because they were written under the assumption that the underlying computing platform is homogenous and has low inter-CPU communication time, i.e. low latency. Starting from the most fundamental level of space-time discretization, we will develop the first electrodynamic simulation software that is latency-tolerant and cloud-optimized. The work completed in Phase I developed several proof-of-concept cloud-based electrodynamic solvers and demonstrated that commercial cloud computing platform is a viable option for offering extremely low cost computing. The general solver to be developed in Phase II will serve a broad set of applications, and will be commercialized as the electromagnetic simulation service in the cloud, featuring a fully immersive web-based visualization interface.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a probiotic treatment that may be used to reduce or eliminates Salmonella and other infections in poultry. The recent FDA Veterinary Feed Directive will result in the use of antibiotics being phased out of livestock production. New technologies are needed to control pathogens in the absence of antibiotics. The goal of this technology is the reduction of pathogens in pre-harvest poultry, which may result in safer food and reduced foodborne illnesses.  In addition, this technology may help reduce the amount of antibiotics used in poultry production, which has been cited as a major factor in the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

    This SBIR Phase II project will result in the development of novel antimicrobial technologies using probiotics engineered to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins with remarkable bactericidal properties. During Phase I, probiotics were built successfully and tested as AMP-delivery vehicles. Probiotics are bile-resistant microorganisms that can be provided to animals safely in their food or water.  The antimicrobial probiotics will be used to test the reduction of pathogens in poultry guts. Pathogens in poultry guts are considered the major source of contamination of poultry meat during processing. The engineered probiotics will use synthetic DNA promoter regions that are designed to precisely control the delivery of AMPs at the site of infection.  The impact will be examined in field trials of probiotics with controllable AMP delivery on poultry challenged by Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni, two common foodborne pathogens. Antimicrobial probiotics also will be tested against Clostridia perfringens, the causal agent of poultry necrotic enteritis, an illness that causes billions of dollars in productivity losses every year in the US.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims
    to develop a MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS)-based radio transceiver providing
    a steep reduction in operating power for wireless data transmission in battery-powered
    devices. Conventional technology offerings for such radios are numerous, but with
    10's of mW of power consumption they are unable to operate for long periods on
    batteries or scavenged power. If the low power radio promised by MEMS technology
    is realized, battery life of consumer products such as wireless headphones can
    be greatly extended, and battery size reduced, saving money and increasing convenience
    to the end user. With the spread of compact wearable and consumer devices, battery
    space is becoming increasingly at a premium, strongly incentivizing lower power
    electronics. As this technology matures, the expanding interconnection of devices
    (aka, the Internet of Things) offers yet greater potential. With rapidly expanding
    market adoption of wireless connectivity for sensing, control, and data collection,
    power consumption is becoming a major limiter in device deployment. If lower power
    transceivers are available, wired devices may be replaced by wireless and battery
    replacement cycles reduced or even done away with altogether, saving time and
    money, and paving the way to true interconnection of all things. \n\nThe work
    of this Phase II SBIR project will focus on designing and verifying performance
    of the MEMS-based radios using fabrication processes suitable for mass production
    and commercial distribution. By combining MEMS technology with traditional circuit
    design, the proposed system will enable a 10x reduction in power consumption,
    low enough that these radios will allow extended operation on battery power alone.
    In the phase I project, the feasibility of the MEMS-based receiver was tested
    using resonators compatible with currently available MEMS foundry processes, and
    power consumption of the core radio-frequency transceiver components was verified
    at a low 300 mW. In phase II, these results will be expanded upon to add the additional
    transceiver components and software stack needed for a complete commercial product.
    The resultant design will be then transferred to the commercial foundry processes
    needed for mass production. The end goal of this project is to demonstrate a complete
    MEMS-based radio compatible with the widely-used Bluetooth Low-Energy protocol
    while operating on a total of only 2 mW in receive-mode."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will continue development of a non-resorbable surgical film which prevents internal tissue-attachment. The proposed device will improve post-surgical outcomes from patients who suffer from internal tissue-attachment triggered by cardiothoracic or neurological surgery. Patients who undergo surgery are at risk for developing unwanted tissue-attachment due to trauma as a result of surgical intervention. This tissue-attachment can lead to severe complications and increase the burden of post-operative care resulting additional expenditures through extended hospital stays, readmissions, and increased morbidity and mortality rates. In addition, undesirable tissue attachment can obstruct the surgical field upon re-operation when necessary. Surgical related tissue-attachment is a problem amongst many surgical procedures in a number of areas. However, cardiothoracic and neurological procedures are often more complicated than gastrointestinal or gynecologic procedures, making any complications more expensive and risky to providers, payers and patients. Additionally, re-operations in cardiac or neuro-spine cases are extremely difficult, which underscore the need for an effective solutions to prevent this malady even more urgent. A product that can effectively prevent undesirable tissue-attachment and provide the surgeon with a clear surgical field and plane of view would be highly desirable in both cardio-thoracic and neurological surgery.

    The proposed project will conduct additional pre-clinical work leading to a regulatory submission for a cardio-thoracic indication and additional validation within the neurological field. Positive animal studies completed during Phase I & IB efforts revealed the capacity of the Sintact Film? to reduce tissue attachment and provide for a clear field of view upon re-entry or re-operation. Initial Phase II work will examine the feasibility of scaling-up certain manufacturing and production processes resulting in a clinical grade product which will undergo sterility, safety, animal, biocompatibility, and mechanical testing. This testing will be compared directly to a predicate or equivalent approved medical device. Results will need to show equivalency of the Sintact Film? to the predicate device across all testing metrics. Additional Phase II work will enable further validation of the Sintact Film? for neurological indications. A larger definitive neurological study will be completed to address the capability of the Sintact Film? to be deployed effectively in a neurological setting. Positive results from this study will provide a basis for pursuing expanded indications and additional market opportunities. If successful the implications that a non-resorbable product can be an effective countermeasure in these areas would alter the current methodology in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop natural alternatives to synthetic chemicals that are used to impart color to food, medicine, and cosmetics. Negative health impacts of some high volume synthetic colorants are driving demand for natural and safe colorants that are obtained from biological sources. This project will advance the commercial feasibility of a class of naturally occurring pigments that have properties of color, functionality, stability, and safety that make them attractive as food colorants. Based on six years of prior university research, a potentially suitable botanical source of a red pigment has been identified.  The goal of this project is to develop a commercial process to produce the pigment from this botanical source. The pigment will be tested as a replacement for a synthetic red pigment that has been widely used as a food additive.  The goal is to provide a natural alternative to reduce the health risks associated with artificial colorants.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a naturally occurring red pigment from a plant source as an alternative food color additive.  Phase I demonstrated that the red pigment could be extracted at small-scale and performed well in food applications.  The goal of this Phase II project is to scale up commercial processes for extraction and purification of this red pigment, and to conduct further performance testing. The pigment, which previously has not been available in commercial quantities, will be produced from a selected variety of a major crop species. The goal is to develop processes to scale pigment production under conditions that will validate a commercial scale.  This will include the integration of mechanical separation, food grade extraction, and various commercially-available clarification systems. The products will be tested for performance characteristics and consistency of quality during scale up by examining thermal, pH, and light stability in a range of probable food and other applications.  In addition, yield produced will be evaluated to validate economic competitiveness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to combat modern day slavery in the United States and Canada. In this project the company will go beyond the public sector, selling its capabilities to the hospitality industry, which shares a role in tackling this problem. Banks also play a part in detecting financial transactions which stem from criminal revenue streams. These new markets expand the revenue opportunity and social impact of the technology. The proposed Phase II research and development will solve huge challenges voiced by the company's law enforcement users. The deployment of these research products through a platform that enables evidence management and collaboration will accelerate the impact by increasing communication among the fragmented law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States. This will enable agencies to conduct more effective investigations, and empower them to take on larger cases involving organized crime across state lines. Finally, human expertise will be developed within the company and through its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University to commercialize advanced computing research for real-world, social impact. These innovations will empower more victim rescues and exploiter prosecutions. The project will create a culture within the company to nurture engineers in social entrepreneurship.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will expand on machine learning technology created in Phase I to deobfuscate escort ads and implement end-to-end innovations for investigations. Each day, there are thousands of online data points related to prostitution. Hidden behind this content are victims of sex trafficking, those forced or coerced into sex work, including juveniles who have not reached the age of consent. Big Data presents the opportunity to seize this information to disrupt traffickers and organized groups who drive the cycle of exploitation. The company's research objectives include maximizing evidence recall using sophisticated crawlers and deobfuscation methods, as well as generating leads using natural language processing and multi-modal machine learning. The project will further develop computer vision capabilities to interpret features of an image and enable visual search for missing victims. It will formalize methods for collecting ground truth, preventing false positives, and diagnosing algorithmic performance relevant to users' needs. Finally, the company will deploy this research into accessible software products that provide real-time, digestible, and actionable information to law enforcement, resulting in the rescue of hundreds, or potentially thousands, of sex trafficking victims.

    develop copper based pastes for the metallization of silicon solar cells. Photovoltaics
    (PV) offer an opportunity for clean and affordable energy and over the past decade
    the PV industry has seen annual compound growth rates of over 50%. Although revenues
    are high, the profit margins for many manufacturers have substantially diminished,
    necessitating the need for cutbacks throughout the value chain. One area marked
    for cost reduction, is in the metallization of the solar cells, which now commands
    nearly 10 percent of the world's supply. Having the cost of photovoltaic panels
    tied to a precious metal with price volatility can lead to higher prices for renewable
    energy; thus replacing silver with copper is a significant opportunity for the
    industry. Thus the outcomes of this project would be a product for making solar
    energy more affordable. The project also includes creating two new full time positions
    in Kentucky in Advanced Research and Manufacturing. This proposal will enhance
    scientific understanding of the copper-silicon contact formation and durability
    of the material during operation. \n\nThe technological feasibility of the copper
    pastes with an inherent diffusion barrier was demonstrated on standard and bifacial
    solar cells in Phase I. Phase II will further improve the screen printable pastes
    to industry standards. To achieve the high electrical performance required in
    this market, the project will investigate the copper-silicon interface to investigate
    the mechanisms involved during contact formation, and the chemical nature of the
    copper-silicon interface. This information will be used to optimize the chemical
    composition and thermal treatment of the pastes to improve electrical performance
    and cell lifetime. The pastes will be optimized for industrial operating equipment
    to provide the manufacturer with a product that can be dropped in, with minimal
    changes to the production line. Phase II will also involve scale up of the core
    materials in the pastes to be able to engage customers in further printing trials.
    Through the assembly and testing of prototype solar cell modules, the durability
    of the copper contacts will be demonstrated. The outcomes of this proposal will
    be screen printable copper pastes that can be direct drop in replacement for the
    silver pastes; thereby enhancing the profit margins of the solar cell manufacturer."

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is far-reaching in terms of improving the quality
    of life and the cost/efficacy of healthcare for more than 20 Million people in
    the USA. We address the need for better methods for identifying and guiding the
    treatment of ambulatory patients with dangerous heart dysfunctions such as intermittent
    arrhythmias and heart failure. For example, atrial fibrillation arrhythmia afflicts
    nearly 8 Million patients in the USA, approximately 460,000 new patients every
    year, and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050. The disease
    and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.)
    add $26B to the nation's annual healthcare costs. Heart Failure currently afflicts
    nearly 5.7 Million people in the US growing to 8 Million by 2030. Their treatment
    and frequent hospitalization costs are already at 14B$ and will grow to 29B$ by
    2030.  Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would be of an enormous
    benefit to human health to create a device that improves the diagnosis and guides
    effective therapy for these patients while they remain fully ambulatory and going
    about their normal activities outside the expensive confines of the hospital.\n
    \ \n\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits. In our Phase
    I STTR program we focused on developing a wearable Atrial Fibrillation monitor
    to assist physicians in the diagnosis of paroxysmal or episodic versions of that
    disorder. In Phase II we have pivoted towards the even more critical need of ambulatory
    monitoring of paroxysmal tachycardia and eventually heart failure patients. The
    current industry standard of ambulatory ECG does not provide enough sensitivity
    or specificity to determine if the patient has atypical or typical atrial flutter,
    paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia as well as various forms of ventricular
    tachycardia. Accurately diagnosing and monitoring these disorders is critical
    to patient treatment and outcomes. Our device will be capable of ambulatory patient
    monitoring for any sort of arrhythmia, and we believe it can be the preferred
    choice for all portable monitoring if it provides in one device ECG, heart motion
    and breathing rate/pattern/volume. So, the overarching technical research goal
    of our Phase II work is to develop a full featured prototype cardiac motion sensor
    as described above that can be used for initial clinical tests. These features
    include: wearable, battery powered, signal storage, cardiac motion from radar,
    disposable antenna, onboard ECG, and breathing rate."

- abstractText: "The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
    implement a proprietary rare earth extraction process on recycled NdFeB magnets
    at pilot scale to prove commercial production feasibility. By recovering rare
    earth elements (REEs) readily available in waste streams, this effort will help
    create a secondary source of these critical elements, thereby reducing U.S. dependence
    on an unstable, limited supply from China. This will, in turn, lay the groundwork
    necessary for the production of cutting-edge technologies reliant upon these materials
    to return to the U.S.  The Nd and Dy elements which are recovered from this process
    are the critical components that increase the efficiency of electric motors by
    up to 30%. The availability of these resources will also significantly improve
    the vertical integration of manufacturing for national security technologies that
    depend heavily upon REEs, such as guided missile actuators and jet-fighter control
    panels. This project will also impact the electronics recycling sector by creating
    a new, reliable revenue stream for electronics recycling companies.\n \nThe process
    to reclaim REEs from NdFeB magnets is simple and energy-efficient, with a minimal
    environmental footprint. The Phase I SBIR project demonstrated the feasibility
    of developing the process beyond laboratory scale to pilot scale, improved the
    purity of the end product and reduced the amount of waste from processing.  The
    Phase II project will focus on the following objectives: 1) designing a scale
    up strategy and building a pilot scale production plant; 2) optimizing the pilot
    scale production process; 3) maximizing product recovery at pilot scale; 4) designing
    a wastewater treatment and reuse strategy; and 5) minimizing residual contamination
    in the final products.  To achieve these Phase II objectives, we will develop
    process parameters for maximum yield, maximum purity, and minimum processing times
    at pilot scale. The first stage will be to successfully obtain production yields
    of 90+% and purity levels of 99+% in pilot scale batches. For the second stage,
    we will focus on scaling production to prove commercial-scale feasibility, with
    ideal product yields and purities of 95+% and 99+% respectively. Throughout all
    stages, we will focus on understanding and treating the accompanying waste products,
    including wastewater and residual metal impurities."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project is to produce economically the next generation of sustainable, renewable, clean burning, high energy density, transportation biofuels. The proposed technology once successfully developed will enable existing biofuel producers to reduce their costs while increasing the value and diversity of their byproducts. It will convert their industrial waste products into tailored fatty acids suitable for biodiesel. The technology will be compatible with and complementary to cellulosic ethanol producers, and it could potentially double the amount of biodiesel produced in the U.S. today. The 227 domestic ethanol plants range in size from less than 50 to more than 150 million gallons, and they have a total annual capacity of 15 billion gallons. Every gallon of ethanol also yields 1.9 pounds of soluble organics that must be evaporated or disposed. Xylome?s technology has the potential to convert half of this stream into biodiesel and to expand biodiesel production further with cellulosic feedstocks. By converting a larger fraction of the soluble cellulosic and hemicellulosic sugars along with fermentation byproducts, Xylome will increase the efficiency of existing ethanol plants and increase biofuel production.

    The objectives of this Phase II research are to increase the rates of production, modification and release of fatty acids from non-conventional lipogenic yeast.  Fatty acids have much higher energy density than ethanol, but similar specific energy yields. Fermentation of organics to lipids can potentially occur with efficiencies equivalent to ethanol production. Lipids normally accumulate under nitrogen limiting conditions after replication has stopped. They are not excreted from the cells so recovery does not require distillation. In Phase I, Xylome scientists identified and over expressed genes that increase lipid accumulation by 1.2- to 2-fold under high nitrogen conditions. In Phase II, they will use mating, selection, screening and evolutionary adaptation to combine the best of these modifications. Xylome scientists have also targeted additional genes to modify and release fatty acids from the cell. Xylome plans to optimize lipid production both from a cellular level with metabolic engineering and from an engineering perspective through bioprocess design and cultivation conditions. Xylome will also engineer cells to use rapidly the complex mixture of soluble oligosaccharides, hemicellulosic sugars and fermentation byproducts. By applying advanced molecular techniques and synthetic biology, Xylome will open up new opportunities for sustainable biofuel production.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to improve wheat yield globally by deploying newly developed, region-specific dwarfing genes. World population is predicted to grow to 9.6 billion by 2050. Wheat demand is expected to increase also due to a shift from rice to wheat consumption due to an expected increase in wealth around the globe. The increased wheat demand will have to be met under less land area and changing climate. Water use efficiency and increase in wheat yields will be important factors in meeting this demand. The proposed technology is poised to increase wheat yield under abiotic stress conditions. All of these benefits are expected to have a major positive impact on humanity.  The wheat seed business is currently valued at up to $8.3 billion. The proposed technology will provide a competitive advantage to capture a significant market share of the wheat seed industry while contributing positively towards food security during the changing climate.

    This SBIR phase II project proposes to further develop and test alternative dwarfing genes to improve wheat yield and abiotic stress tolerance around the globe. Responsible for the "green-revolution," dwarfing genes are required to obtain higher yields, but the two dwarfing genes present in more than 90% of the currently grown wheat varieties have serious ill-effects including abiotic stress sensitivity, reduced root length and biomass, seedling emergence, and vigor. During the Phase I research, four new dwarfing genes were identified and shown to be significantly better than the currently used genes. Phase II will focus on the comparison of the new genes with the old genes to show their true benefits. This research also will generate valuable data required for the development of "release-ready" varieties.  Genetic background effects will be studied by transferring one of the new dwarfing genes into two different backgrounds followed by field and controlled condition evaluation. Future competitive advantage will be maintained by pyramiding the new dwarfing genes with complementary gene action. Closely linked DNA markers will be developed for an efficient transfer of the technology into diverse backgrounds.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.

    The technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project, in which a non-invasive respiratory muscle stimulation
    device and approach to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation will be developed,
    is a reduction in public health care expenditure and a reduction in morbidity
    for the half a million patients who have difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation
    each year in the US. These patients suffer from an array of clinical complications
    (for example, pneumonia) and cost the US health care system $16 billion annually,
    a great deal of which is borne by Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current
    reimbursement landscape economically incentivizes hospitals to wean patients at
    the earliest possible time. The proposed innovation has the potential to positively
    benefit society by providing a solution to this serious healthcare problem. In
    addition, it promises to improve our scientific understanding of respiratory muscle
    physiology and mechanics in difficult to wean patients. It will also improve our
    technical understanding of non-invasive respiratory sensors and biofeedback algorithms
    for the purposes of electrical muscle stimulation. Finally, as demonstrated by
    the number and cost of difficult to wean patients, as well as current healthcare
    reimbursement policies, the proposed innovation has potential to results in a
    considerable commercial impact.  \n \nThe proposed project will develop a non-invasive
    electrical stimulator that automatically applies stimulation to the respiratory
    muscles in synchrony with a patient?s voluntary breathing pattern. This approach
    is expected to address the imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and respiratory
    muscle load - a major factor responsible for weaning difficulty - by assisting
    ventilation during weaning sessions and strengthening the breathing muscles that
    have become weakened as a result of mechanical ventilation. In Phase 1 a functional
    prototype was developed; clinical feasibility of the approach was also demonstrated.
    \ The Phase II proposal focuses on refining the stimulation algorithm to maximize
    its clinical effectiveness and on developing a novel stimulation electrode system
    so that the device can be quickly applied to patients. In addition, methods will
    be developed to interface the technology with a mechanical ventilator to expand
    its clinical application. Finally, a complete works-like, looks-like prototype
    will be developed that is designed to international standards and is safe for
    clinical testing. The work completed in this Phase of the project will enable
    a controlled clinical trial of the proposed approach and ultimately allow the
    device to gain FDA regulatory clearance."

    adaptive online learning platform founded on the principles of adaptive learning.
    The online learning system provides adaptive learning strategies with real-time
    learner analytics. The system integrates learner analytics from four dimensional
    aspects of learning: multi-media, learning strategies, interactivity, and social
    interaction-- to deliver a personalized learning experience for science, technology,
    engineering, and math (STEM) students for significant improvement in the learning
    outcome. The adaptive learning software technology platforms with personalized
    learning strategies have demonstrated high completion and satisfaction rates for
    online students taking post-secondary courses. In this SBIR Phase II we propose
    to develop a unique data driven decision support interface that will result in
    real-time big data analytics for both individuals and large numbers of learners.
    The volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (the 4 Vs of big data) will be generated
    by the collection of data at individual schools first, with the potential to aggregate
    data from district, state, and even national levels.  The big-data analytics of
    the learner trajectories through the adaptive learning platform will uncover patterns
    that can improve understanding of learner behavior in education.  \n\nBig data,
    generated by the adaptive learning systems related to learner behavior in each
    learning strategy, will lead to valuable insights on efficacy of the proposed
    methodology and further development of the product on mobile platforms in the
    Phase II.  The learner analytics will provide the basis for intelligent feedback
    based on the statistical evidence.  The proposed method of data driven decision
    process for adaptive learning is based on the real- time cross-correlation statistical
    analysis of the predictor variables for an individual learner.  The field trials
    of the proposed method will be conducted in the participating high schools.  Collection
    of data for a group of students collected during the field trials in high schools
    will lead to discovery of learning patterns for the clusters of learners in each
    learning strategy. The previous Phase I research has led to the development of
    an analytical model for volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of data collected
    at school-wide level.  This reports form this data is used for the development
    of decision tree and regression analysis to find correlations (knowledge discovery)
    that can be used for the improvement of learning enterprise (school). The data-driven
    feedback to students and the group analytics for teachers will provide necessary
    feedback mechanism for improving competency and graduation rates for STEM education

    public speaking skills and prepare students with better oral communications skills
    necessary to perform job tasks. Oral expression is the most highly valued ability
    throughout the economy and ranks as the second most highly-valued skill for high-wage,
    high-growth, high-skill occupations. Approximately 4.5 million college students
    take a basic communications course each year, however, as class sizes get larger
    and online learning becomes more common, public speaking instruction becomes increasingly
    difficult.  Practice and feedback are essential aspects of these courses, yet
    it is a struggle for teachers to find enough time to sufficiently interact with
    students. This SBIR project aims to develop the key concepts of automated public
    speaking assessment such that a student?s vocal delivery can be objectively measured
    and presented in a manner that creates an independent, personalized learning experience.
    Unlike traditional methods of public speaking assessment, the proposed system
    can be available at any time, provide objective feedback and track student practice
    and improvement. The proposed Software-as-a-Service is projected to generate $16
    Million in revenue over five years and create more than 25 high-paying, US-based
    jobs. \n\n\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes
    to develop an automated assessment system for public speaking that determines
    how a speaker would be perceived by an audience.  Automated assessment for speech
    has already occurred in spoken language proficiency, which leverages Automated
    Speech Recognition (ASR) and semantic analysis. Automated voice assessment has
    also been utilized in lie detection and emotion detection, which focus on autonomic
    responses in the user?s voice, such as when stress affects the vocal cords. The
    hypothesis behind this SBIR project is that speakers can consciously use and modify
    non-semantic speech behaviors to produce more desirable listener perceptions.
    Automatically linking listener perception to speech behaviors represents a novel
    direction in automated assessment for speech. The Phase II objective is to develop
    software sufficient for automated public speaking assessment such that a student?s
    vocal delivery can be objectively measured and presented in a manner that creates
    an independent, personalized learning experience. Voice analytics capability investigated
    in Phase I will be enhanced and developed into a cloud-based service which helps

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to improve cleaning in the food processing industry by integrating hyper-stable enzymes into cleaning products. Industrial enzymes are a growing, multi-billion dollar green industry that reduces energy, water, and harsh chemical use while improving process efficiency in many sectors. Despite the broad use and success of industrial enzymes, their application and economic impact has been severely limited by narrow thermal and chemical operational ranges available. The company has developed heat and acid stable enzymes that significantly expand the reach of enzyme applications. The goal is to develop an initial product for the dairy cleaning market that will have the potential to increase production due to faster cleaning, achieve better removal of protein contaminants and biofilms, reduce water usage, and reduce food product exposure to chemicals and chemical waste. Better cleaning with enzymes has the potential to prevent food-borne illness, and decrease water use, while increasing food-processing profits and providing a biodegradable alternative to chemical cleaners.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using the first practical protein expression platform to produce hyperstable enzymes for commercial use. Although the genes from extreme organisms have been studied for over forty years, their commercial potential has not been realized due to their incompatibility with traditional protein expression systems. The unique hyperstability of enzymes produced using the company's technologies indicate that enzyme stability is not encoded entirely by gene sequence. In Phase II, the goal is to develop more comprehensive cleaning formulations and test these with laboratory and field trial methods established in Phase I. The project encompasses a set of integrated experiments spanning molecular biology, microbiology, biochemistry, dairy processor field trials, and practical industrial bioprocess optimization. The aim is to transform the world's most extreme enzymes into the world's most effective products for membrane defouling and sanitation in the dairy industry and beyond.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to offer custom crafted digital voices for text-to-speech applications. Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce a new type of computer memory called Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM). FEDRAM is cheap and can be mass-produced in current semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It also uses much less energy than current-state-of-the-art memories, and enables electronic devices to be much smaller in physical size. Commercially, FEDRAM works best as an embedded memory, which means they are ideally suited for products such as mobile phones where the processor and memory are on the same chip. Additionally, the same block of FEDRAM can be configured for high performance applications in addition to longer storage applications. This means that future devices will adapt to maximize power, performance, and usability. Due to the factors of price, performance, and low power, once FEDRAM is proven to work, it can potenitally be adopted in nearly every electronic device.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the commercialization questions of Ferroelectric Dynamic Random Access Memory (FEDRAM).  In SBIR Phase I, it was shown that FEDRAM cells can be manufactured in an existing foundry with no new materials or equipment changes, and that FEDRAM has leading performance characteristics. The next step is to prove the same characteristics in an array, which would be considered a minimum viable product; this is the goal of SBIR Phase II. By proving this array,  it will be possible to quickly scale the FEDRAM memory array into embedded applications for commercial deployment.  The performance characteristics to be demonstrated are read/write latency, switching time, endurance, retention, and energy use.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide the paint and coatings industry with new high-performance, cost-competitive polymer/resin systems that reduce solvent emissions and use of petrochemicals.  In addition, these new polymer/resin systems enable one-component, ambient-cure coatings to be produced.  This means that highly protective coatings can be produced without the need for mixing multiple components together prior to application or applying heat or light to cure the coatings.  The one-component, ambient-cure features of these polymer/resin systems largely eliminate waste and energy costs associated with coating application and lend themselves to the production of paints and coatings that can be applied by the average person.  Compared to the current state-of-the-art in one-component, ambient-cured resins, these new polymer/resin systems provide dramatically shorter drying times, dramatically better chemical resistance, and much higher film hardness, while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and flexibility.  The highly desirable properties of these new cost-competitive polymer/resin systems will enable commercial success, while their low solvent emissions and high renewable content will reduce impact on the environment.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to: 1) further optimize the polymer/resin systems to produce compositions that minimize solvent content and maximize performance, while meeting the cost constraints of the market; 2) put in place a pilot-line to provide potential customers with adequate sample sizes to enable their own evaluation of potential products, 3) generate weathering, corrosion, and storage/shelf stability data to further understand the application potential of optimized polymer/resin systems; and 4) optimize the polymer/resin production process to minimize cost and minimize production waste.  By meeting these objectives, the Phase II project will result in the generation of new polymer/resin systems that will enable the development and commercialization of new paints and coatings that are one-component, ambient-cured, low in solvent content that exhibit exceptional properties, while being primarily based on renewable materials.  Optimized polymer/resin systems will be provided to potential customers for their own internal evaluation.  If necessary, feedback from customer evaluations will be used to modify polymer/resin system composition to meet customer needs.  By the end of the Phase II project, the technology will be ready to proceed to manufacturing scale-up and product commercialization.

    deliver a cost-effective automated quality control (QC) system for manufacturing
    of radioactive drugs used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This system will
    replace current QC procedures, which involve 18 manual operations, 8 visual assessments,
    6 devices, and 8 samples of radioactive drugs. The industry's current reliance
    on manual operation, subjectivity and untraceable records impedes progress in
    radioactive drug manufacturing and presents compliance risks. Therefore, introduction
    of an automated system combining all these tests on a single platform will facilitate
    adoption of PET imaging technology beyond top tier medical centers. By addressing
    a critical current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliance need in radio-pharmaceutical
    production, which cannot be addressed with any other solutions available today,
    this solution is positioned for rapid adoption.  After adopting this system, it
    is expected that manufacturing facilities will realize 20% operating cost reduction
    and 50% reduction in time spent on QC-related activities. A reduced cost of compliance
    associated with introduction of automated QC will further contribute to the adoption
    rate.  This project will open the door to new applications of plate reader technology,
    an approach which has been traditionally confined to the fields of biochemistry
    and diagnostics.  \n\nThis Phase II effort includes four technical objectives.
    \ Firstly, the approach will be adapted to minimize the required sample volume.
    \ Methods developed in Phase I of the project required 0.5 ml of sample, a value
    which is not optimal for small manufacturers. To bring this value down to 0.2
    ml, test sensitivity will be adjusted, keeping in mind the potential dynamic range
    trade-offs.  Secondly, we will design a plastic consumable that supports adoption
    by a commercial manufacturer.  Current plastic prototype components are only suitable
    for academic sites with highly-skilled personnel.  To reduce the amount of training
    required, and to expand the applicability of this method, a new plastic component
    will be designed in order to further automate sample loading.  Third, we will
    optimize the formulation of the reagents to achieve a one-year shelf life for
    the consumable kit.  The shelf life of the reagents developed in Phase I remains
    unknown.  Therefore, accelerated stability studies will be performed to estimate
    the rates of decomposition processes, and appropriate changes will be made to
    enhance shelf life. Finally, we will develop a pilot production process for the
    newly-designed kit, in order to support early installations."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and produce a robust, hand-held, video-rate three-dimensional surface metrology system with vertical and lateral resolution of several micrometers, in order to bridge a critical existing metrology gap for precision-machined surfaces.  Many modern manufactured parts, such as turbine blades, drive shafts, orthopedics, and various additive manufactured components require in-situ metrology with high resolution for accurate characterization during manufacturing and/or maintenance operations.  Current high-resolution surface measurement systems are slow, vibration-sensitive and laboratory-based and thus are impractical for everyday use by manufacturing technicians.  Meanwhile, shop-floor inspection is often only visual, and thus qualitative rather than quantitative, leading both to rejections of acceptable components as well as potential acceptance of failing ones.  The absence of high-precision, in-situ metrology has hindered manufacturers from applying real-time data analysis and closed-loop process controls that can improve yields and reduce manufacturing costs.  This research program will yield a hand-held, easy-to-use, robust, and quantitative shop-floor measurement system, allowing manufacturers to improve lifetimes, performance, and yield as they rapidly assess the features under test and feed the results back to improve process control.

    During Phase I, a breadboard system was designed and implemented using a polarization-based fringe projection method and micropolarizer phase-mask technology to achieve vibration insensitive measurement in a compact package.  This Phase II program leverages that research to design a video-rate, compact, robust and portable system for handheld surface measurements in shop-floor environments. This will first involve improvements to measurement resolution with an improved optical design and new self-calibrating measurement modes; new optical elements will lower noise artifacts caused by imperfections in the earlier design and to reduce system size.  Once performance of the new design is verified, an ergonomic, compact, robust, wireless housing for the instrument must be created to enable shop-floor use; the system must handle drops of over one meter onto concrete, have useful battery life for extended field operations, be light enough to not fatigue users and have intuitive controls and feedback.  A final, critically important development effort will create automated software routines for measurement, analysis, and system diagnostics to enable adoption by unskilled personnel in manufacturing environments.  Lastly, extensive applications testing in the field will allow optimization of the system to handle a wide range of potential use cases and environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. Using current methods, the oil industry is able to extract only 5% of the known hydrocarbon from shale formation. This represents more than $500B of potential oil and gas that cannot be economically produced for the US economy. The aim is to increase the efficiency of oil production by providing novel subsurface information to improve operational decision making. The resulting value increase for a producer can be up to $1M per well. In addition, it is possible to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the hydraulic fracturing process, which is currently only 50% efficient. By providing novel subsurface data for the industry, this information can reduce environmental impact by saving up to 45B gallons of fresh water and 1M rail cars of mined sand. Furthermore, the analysis of subsurface microbiomes is a rich area for new academic knowledge.  Over 80% of the microbial strains identified in Phase I have never been documented in public references. This work not only provides economic and social value, but also expands scientific knowledge.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use next-generation microbiome analyses to increase the efficiency of domestic oil production. The research objective is to analyze the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome to characterize hydrocarbon reservoirs and leverage this new data source to increase current efficiency rates. The goal is to analyze 50 producing wells in the Southwestern US, and develop statistical models linking microbial profiles to key reservoir properties that can increase production efficiencies. The analytical method employed will utilize technology stemming from over $20 million in government funding to the University of Colorado used to create bioinformatics software known as "QIIME."  The QIIME technology has been extensively tested in analyzing and modeling the human microbiome, but has never been applied to the subsurface hydrocarbon microbiome prior to the Phase I work.  By combining advances in cloud computing, DNA sequencing, and novel software analytics, this project will demonstrate that these microbial communities correlate to meaningful production parameters for the oil and gas industry. In so doing, the project will demonstrate at pilot scale that this new information source can be utilized as a novel, non-invasive, low-cost reservoir characterization tool that allows the industry to maximize hydrocarbon production while minimizing environmental impact.

    and sustainable alternative to traditional fired masonry materials.  This product
    is grown in ambient temperatures utilizing a natural calcium carbonate cement

    technology is critically dependent on achieving cost and performance parity, if
    not superiority, with traditional materials.  Each year, 1.23 trillion fired bricks
    are produced globally for use in construction, resulting in over 800 million tons

    testing for physical performance, weathering and durability, in-house production
    of robust raw material constituents, and commercial testing coupled with pilot
    manufacturing. Rigorous ASTM testing methods will be done at two accredited labs,
    and labor requirements will be reduced via the adoption of lean automation in
    the production process. Additionally, the utilization of existing material handing
    manufacturing equipment at licensee facilities, where possible, will be evaluated.
    Expected project results will include a comprehensive statistical analysis of
    multiple physical samples, as well as a corresponding failure analysis. Additional

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development of a nanoparticle characterization instrument that will fill the critical unmet need to rapidly and accurately measure the size and distribution of nanoparticles from 30 nanometers to 1 micron. Initially the technology will target two applications: protein aggregation in biopharmaceuticals, and nanoparticles in medicine (e.g., tumor-targeted drug delivery). The importance of nanoparticle analysis, however, goes well beyond therapeutics. Currently the market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation across the life sciences is $5.6 billion, and there are increasing concerns about nanoparticles in consumer products such as food and cosmetics, as well as in drinking water, effluents, and the environment. A major challenge in understanding the health impacts of nanoparticles is simply in accurately and easily detecting their presence and size distribution. Additionally, improved nanoparticle instrumentation will enable new discoveries in biotechnology and environmental and health sciences.

    This challenge can be met by developing a practical method for counting and sizing submicron particles in polydisperse mixtures. NSF Phase I/IB funds supported development of a prototype instrument that detects individual nanoparticles and accurately measures their size, at very high count rates. This instrument has successfully demonstrated robust detection of individual particles as small as 60 nm in diameter at rates approaching 10,000 particles per second, and has already begun to deliver useful information to particle manufacturers in the pharmaceutical industry, with on-going measurements of actual customer samples. The Phase II support will considerably enhance the utility of this instrument by addressing several outstanding technical challenges; most significantly, by extending the range of detectable particles to span the full range from 30 nm to 1000 nm, and by further maximizing the range of measurable particle concentrations.  In addition, the Phase II work will drive significant improvements in functionality and ease of use, driven by innovations in its control software. Finally, the instrument will be further validated using a wide variety of particle types relevant beyond the pharmaceutical space.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is development of a microbial technology for the conversion of low-value sugars into high-value chemicals. Most industrial chemicals produced today are derived from petroleum and other nonrenewable raw materials. The long-term growth and sustainability of the chemical industry benefits from development of new routes to existing chemicals using renewable raw materials. Furthermore, due to higher infrastructure costs and stricter environmental requirements, many chemicals that were once produced in the United States are now produced abroad. This contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. This Phase II proposal aims to develop a fermentation technology where domestically grown agricultural materials (for example, corn and waste agricultural residues) are converted into high-value chemicals. The optimized fermentation process is estimated to be cost-competitive with the incumbent petrochemical route when scaled. If successful, this proposal will facilitate growth of a domestic bio-chemical manufacturing industry, targeting the $30 billion organic acids market.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop large-scale, high-throughput techniques to optimize gene expression in industrial yeast. A significant problem within the field of industrial biotechnology is the ability to engineer and optimize the fermentation performance of non-academic or model microbes. Most molecular metabolic engineering tools are developed for use in two model prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, E. coli and S. cerevisiae, and are not suitable for use with industrially relevant microbes. Without these tools it is costly and slow to commercialize new fermentation technologies. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop and implement a set of molecular biology tools designed for acid-tolerant yeast, and working to apply them toward improving small molecule production. Specifically, the molecular biology tools are useful for tuning (up- or down-regulation) user-defined gene transcription and translation. Engineered microbes harboring the desired genetic modification(s) are assayed for improved small molecule production from sugar in small scale fermentations. Successful genetic modifications are those that result in more efficient small molecule product formation from sugar, and ideally decreased biomass formation from sugar, providing a lower production cost in a scaled, commercial process.

    soaps). Consumers will clearly benefit from this technology through the reduction

    of high-value lipids from a variety of substrates for defined target markets and

    will continue to be made to the nanofiber felts/mats. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial
    potential of this project goes well beyond bioseparations. Due to the many advantages
    of the surface-functionalized electrospun nanofibers made from regenerated cellulose,
    this innovative adsorption material has tremendous commercial potential. Customers
    will come from companies within the biopharmaceutical industry, as well as from
    the established manufacturers of bioseparations adsorption media. Additionally,
    the underlying fundamentals associated with nanofiber adsorption media will have
    a wide range of implications, including more efficient separation processes in
    the water purification industry and the blood products and/or blood purification
    industries. The advantages achieved through this innovative work will lead to
    more efficient separation technologies across many sectors and include faster
    processes, reduced energy consumption, lower materials requirements, and less
    waste generation. In addition to the broader scientific impacts, Nanofiber Separations,
    LLC is committed to creating jobs and to training highly technical staff members,
    providing them with expertise in the interdisciplinary fields of advanced functional
    materials (including nano-scaled materials) and/or biotechnology."

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a novel engineered microbiome as a potential therapeutic for a rare skin disease called Netherton syndrome. Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare, severe skin disease with high mortality and few treatment options. This proposal aims to develop a new therapeutic for this disease, a microbe-based protein delivery system of LEKTI, the missing protein responsible for NS symptoms. At the end of this project, a candidate live biotherapeutic product candidate (LETKI-secreting strain of S. epidermidis) will be nominated and the Company will have sufficient data with which to proceed into formal preclinical studies and subsequent human testing. This proposed product will have the potential to address thousands of patients in the U.S., and the broader proof-of-principle of this microbe-based technology offers significant potential to treat millions of patients living with skin conditions. This offers significant advances in innovation in addition to broad commercial potential.

    This project aims to develop a novel therapeutic candidate composed of an engineered strain of S. epidermidis that secretes LEKTI protein to the skin for the treatment of Netherton syndrome (NS). NS is a rare but severe autosomal recessive disease that affects the skin, hair, and immune system. NS is caused by mutations in in the SPINK5 gene encoding the serine protease inhibitor lymphoepithelial Kazal-type related inhibitor (LEKTI), which contains 15 serine protease inhibitory domains. The goal of this Phase II project is to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapeutic for NS: an engineered commensal microbe that delivers discrete domains of LETKI to the skin. The proposed Phase II research plan will establish critical criteria for nominating a potential live biotherapeutic product (LBP) candidate composed LEKTI-secreting S. epidermidis. This research will perform key activities in preclinical development of an LBP: identify an optimal sequence of LEKTI; develop analytical methods for detecting LEKTI secreted from an engineered strain of S. epidermidis; and develop analytical methods for measuring biodistribution and adsorption of LEKTI secreted by S. epidermidis in a human in vitro model.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project touches upon everything from shower doors to
    consumer electronics to window glass. Deposition of high-quality thin films on
    a large scale with precise energy control can allow, for one example, diamond-like
    carbon (DLC) on glass.  DLC coatings on glass can prevent soapy film build-up
    on shower doors, can improve the scratch resistance of mobile phone displays,
    and can reduce the cost of energy-conserving windows. The control of energy during
    fabrication processes won't just broaden what films can be made; it will allow
    the use of a greater variety of substrates. In recent years, a number of applications
    have utilized traditional inorganic coatings like silicon oxide on top of new
    materials like organic solar cells and organic LEDs. These organic materials show
    greater sensitivity to degradation during the coating processes. This ion beam
    source can give industry, as it begins to bring these innovations to market, a
    tool with the level of energy control that will allow lab results to translate
    to high yield, low cost manufacturing. \n\nThe proposed project addresses the
    challenge of depositing advanced thin films on insulating and/or delicate substrates.
    Control of the deposition's energy flux has been shown in laboratory demonstrations
    to be required for many thin films including diamond-like carbon, transparent
    conductive oxides on silicon and organic solar cells, and ultra-thin silver. A
    scalable linear ion beam sputter source will establish a high-volume manufacturing
    tool for thin films limited today to much smaller scale. In Phase 1, the source's
    functionality was demonstrated. Phase 2 has two major components: hardware development
    for scale and usability; process development for specific commercial applications.
    The company will deliver a fully integrated control system and a source, scaled
    by 2x and designed for manufacture. Process development will consider beam energetics
    and geometry of beam/target/substrate relative to film and substrate properties.
    For DLC, this will focus on tribological and optical properties. For silver, they
    will test for continuity of ultra-thin films. Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO)
    efforts will focus on electrical properties and substrate impacts, particularly
    carrier lifetime in silicon.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery platform that will identify novel types of antibody therapeutics.  The goal is to use antibodies to increase or decrease the activity of a type of cell signaling receptor called "G protein-coupled receptors" (GPCRs). There are more than 400 non-olfactory human GPCRs that are involved in all aspects of health and disease, including cancers, autoimmune diseases, pain, inflammation, and others. About 25% of GPCRs have been targeted by approved small molecule drugs, but efforts for the remaining have often failed because of the inability of small molecules to distinguish between similar GPCRs. Antibody drugs can overcome this hurdle because of their much higher specificity for their targets. This project will bring to commercialization the first technology that directly identifies antibodies that modulate GPCR function. These antibodies will impact healthcare by enabling therapies for diseases with poor or no current treatments. They also will impact scientific understanding by enabling the study of GPCR-related physiology and disease. The commercial impacts are potentially very large. The GPCR drug market is over $100B, and most antibody therapeutics have annual sales over $1B. The platform described here could enable dozens of novel GPCR antibody therapeutics, creating value for patients, society, and co-development partners.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a drug discovery technology for discovering antibodies that modulate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Current methods are limited because GPCR antigens are often not properly folded, and because antibodies are selected by how tightly they bind GPCRs, rather than by the effect they exert. Those that bind typically do not have any effect at all. This project will build on the successful proof-of-concept from Phase I that demonstrated the platform's ability to identify directly functional antibody agonists for a human GPCR. The proposal addresses the four main technical requirements that pharmaceutical customers cite as important: Ability to work on many types of GPCRs, ability to isolate antibodies with varied modulating effects, use of a highly diverse, high-quality scFv library, and a workflow that can quickly isolate, optimize and characterize dozens of candidates. The goals of this project are to improve how the platform's yeasts express GPCRs and functionally couple them to different selectable readouts, construct a proprietary scFv library, and optimize the workflow by incorporating sequencing bioinformatics and antibody characterization, including flow cytometric analysis of cell-binding and functional assays on cultured mammalian cells.

    technologies. Additive manufacturing, or 3D Printing, is a rapidly growing $7bn
    industry, which enables small and medium enterprises to competitively manufacture
    new and innovative products. It is a key to strengthening the US manufacturing
    economy. Continued growth and health of the 3D printing industry, particularly
    for manufacture of functional parts for finished goods, will depend upon an expansion
    of the available material library. 3D printing materials are limited to a small
    segment of the plastics in common industrial use today. This project will expand
    that material library with development of printable polyurethane elastomers with
    a broad range of flexibilities. These materials will be particularly relevant
    for markets that demand personalization and customization, such as patient-specific
    medical devices, sporting goods, and footwear. Manufacturers of flexible, durable
    polyurethane goods for industrial and automotive products will also benefit from
    low cost small-scale production of parts made from materials with performance
    that match their product specifications. The printing system will enable production
    of parts with user-specified geometry and flexibility, and will also enable multi-material
    printing for novel product designs. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will produce
    a set of reactive polyurethane precursor formulas which can be combined to form
    printable, flexible polyurethanes with a broad hardness range. The Phase II project

    will be printed using extrusion 3D printing techniques, and customized to handle
    liquid, reactive feeds. The research approach will include determination of the
    starting materials to control reaction rates, rheology development, and part solidification.
    Software development will incorporate printing parameters for the spectrum of
    materials that can be produced from the starting materials in order to produce
    a user interface where part flexibility is specified as a function of part geometry,
    and the printer receives commands for printing the desired object.  The material
    \ will be parameterized to determine space-filling properties of the material
    as a function of composition, print speed, and printhead geometry.  This 3D printing

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be a user-friendly and scalable infection control surveillance software platform using advanced biotech and data analytics for monitoring hospital-acquired infection. There is a significant clinical problem in hospitals, where 1 in 25 people who check in will develop a hospital acquired infection. Currently, hospital infection control practitioners (ICPs) have few analytical tools to identify the source of these infections, which can be deadly and cost the health care industry an estimate of $45 billion year. The innovation under development harnesses advanced epidemiological approaches in an easy-to-use application that will enable ICPs to use bacterial genetics as a means to monitor infectious spread within their system so that their sources can be eliminated.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to develop an infection control surveillance software system using whole-genome sequencing of pathogens and advanced data analytics.  The innovation addresses the critical lack of accessible genetic analysis applications designed for local infection control surveillance. Hospitals are observing ever increasing rates of antibiotic resistant infections. These are expensive, endanger patients, and are becoming harder to trace as medical care becomes more complex and spread over multiple facilities. Unfortunately, ICPs have few new tools, other than best hygiene practices, to reduce their mounting infection rates. Decades of research has revealed that epidemiological surveillance using genetic analysis provides a robust level of pathogen traceability; however, this knowledge has not been transferred into hospitals where it is critically needed, due to a lack of technical infrastructure and analytical accessibility. In this Phase II project, the goal is to complete the development of a software application that will enable ICPs to easily and accurately process bacterial genetic data in their own offices and generate rich, meaningful and easy to interpret reports concerning bacterial spread in their networks. ICPs will be warned when infection sources relate to each other, suggesting that a deeper investigation is needed. The result is that infection sources, which are currently missed, will be proactively identified and targeted.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will provide commercial validation at scale of feedback-based control of arc behavior within the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process.  This will improve VAR performance in the production of specialty metals, resulting in improvements to ingot quality while reducing electricity consumption.  Specialty metals, such as titanium and nickel alloys, are used in critical high-performance parts in industries such as aerospace, energy, and medicine, where the failure of these parts may lead to catastrophic systems failures and potentially life-threatening situations. In a VAR furnace, extreme temperature gradients from constricted and/or diffuse arcs sustained between the melting electrode and ingot can cause non-homogeneous material and inclusion defects, resulting in up to 8% yield loss per ingot, representing $1.024 billion in losses across the domestic industry.  Improved control over the arc distributions during the melting of these metals is expected to decrease the frequency of defects in the final product and increase overall yield from the process. The proposed project is expected to reduce these loses by up to 50% through the application of active, feedback control of the arc dynamics. This type of control is expected to increase yield, decrease energy requirements, and increase safety of the manufacturing process industry-wide.

    This project will result in a system capable of detecting and manipulating the distribution of the arcs utilized during VAR processing. The Phase I effort showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect arc locations on the electrode and influence their movements, using electromagnetic coils, in real time. In Phase II, the arc measurements will be coupled through feedback to control the arc distribution in an industrial-scale research VAR, providing proof of concept at industrial scale. In so doing, the optimal electromagnetic coil geometry, hardware, and materials for driving the arc motion at scale will be identified and constructed. A series of industrial experiments are planned to validate the control system. The chemical composition of the ingots produced during controlled and uncontrolled conditions will be characterized to correlate defects with observed arc behaviors and to identify optimal control parameters.  Similarly, the measured arc distributions will be used to validate the computational solidification modeling, which will be used to identify probable defect regions. The combination of experimental data and validated simulation results will be used to inform the VAR feedback control system regarding optimal arc distribution, yielding an improved control strategy for tailoring the melt process and improving ingot quality.

    Research (SBIR) project are foundations for an emerging industry: insects in agriculture.
    \ Beta Hatch is pioneering the production of new animal feed ingredients, developing
    technology to mass produce insects, and creating STEM jobs. The proposed work
    will allow scaling insects as a sustainable protein-rich feed ingredient. With
    predictable year-round production, this will contribute to a more robust and secure
    agricultural system. The Beta Hatch insect ranch, which will be designed through
    integration of the results from this project, is an on-site solution to convert
    organic by- products into valuable feed ingredients and fertilizer. These ranches
    are being designed as conversions of underutilized spaces (warehouses and poultry
    barns), to bring jobs to rural and HUBZone areas. We work closely with farmers,
    our main customers, to establish the performance and economic value of our products.
    Insects provide nutrition and make animals healthier. Our frass (insect manure),
    is an organic fertilizer that stimulates healthy soils, and has no nitrates (no
    runoff). The proposed work will allow us to establish insects as the world?s most
    sustainable animal feed ingredient, and to disrupt the $400B animal feed market.
    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to cost effectively scale insect production
    for agricultural markets. Of the millions of insect species that exist, only a
    handful have been successfully reared under controlled conditions and even fewer
    have been mass produced. And yet insects have the potential to fill essential
    roles in agricultural supply chains by biodegrading wastes, removing or recycling
    toxins, and providing nutrition for animals. In order to meet the scale, quality
    and cost requirements for agricultural markets, significant R&D must solve some
    core challenges in insect mass production. We propose to integrate biological
    and engineering approaches to develop novel oviposition substrates, identify and
    mitigate causes of mortality, design automated and flexible diet handling systems,
    optimize rearing trays (the basic unit of production), and maximize yields with
    automated water and diet delivery. The proposed work will cut over 80% of our
    costs, produce several patents, and inform the design of a scalable insect ranching
    facility. As a natural part of animal diets, insects are a predictable protein-rich
    alternative feed ingredient, with year-round controlled production. In Phase 1
    of this project, we established an insect breeding program, explored novel inorganic
    diets, and identified the core production challenges for scaling insects-as-feed.
    For this NSF SBIR Phase 2 project, we develop solutions that will reduce the cost
    of production and control the cost of future facilities.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation

    $7 million today with the potential to increase to more than $14 million in the
    near future. \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is threefold. First, the
    innovative method of fabrication explores and exploits the ultimate capability
    of atomic layer deposition (ALD) for achieving nanometer-scale smoothness in very
    thick, multilayer films. Unlike related methods that rely on deposition onto wires
    and slicing, this method uses ALD to deposit sequences of low and high refractive
    index materials onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors, with well-controlled
    layer thicknesses varying from a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Subsequently,
    polishing the wafer will yield membranes with hundreds of high-value focusing
    devices on a single wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second,
    the envisioned wafer-level processing method allows for a necessary tilt control
    of the precursors, not possible with wires, for better focusing properties. Third,
    the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material
    layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index diffractive devices
    with single foci and featuring ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I qualified
    the individual key processes and proved their integration capability into a complete
    fabrication sequence, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing
    of prototypes and preparation for production, using long runs of atomic layer
    deposition processes, as is necessary for functional devices.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate an additive manufacturing process to produce 3-D woven textile products at scale. Presently, the clothing manufacturing industry still relies on manual sewing machines that were invented over one-hundred and seventy years ago. This system limits the manufacturing process and textile capability; an abundance of steps leads to waste, inefficiencies, and segmented products. Further, due to the low cost of foreign labor, the US textile industry has effectively come to a halt: 97.3 percent of all clothing sold in the United States in 2015 was imported. This project seeks to develop a novel method for manufacturing woven textile products by employing additive manufacturing methodologies to automate the production process, while simultaneously enabling complete customization and on-demand production. This technology will enable premium and competitive textile manufacturing to return from overseas, creating high value-added jobs and a designer community in the United States while also generating tax revenue. In the same way that 3-D printing technology has revolutionized the hard goods manufacturing process, this project seeks to create an entire new industry of additively manufactured textile products, enabling significant opportunities for future innovation.

    This project develops a novel technology to manufacture near-net-shape three dimensional woven textile products. To develop this technology, this project first proved feasibility through creating constituent textile panels of non-standard shapes with 3-D topography in Phase I, laying the foundation for continued development into fully three-dimensional, seamless, finished products produced in-situ through Phase II. By additively producing garments from a unique 3-D model complete customization to each individual consumer is possible on a large scale, though this has never before been accomplished. Further, through the on-demand production of clothing customized to individual consumers, the need for substantial inventory buildup is eliminated. In this way, additively manufactured textile products are both more desirable to consumers and more economical to producers. As such, the societal and environmental benefits of automated and on-demand textile manufacturing within the United States are significant, including eliminating massive amounts of waste from typical cut-and-sew manufacturing techniques, revamping a struggling American manufacturing industry, and minimizing the economical, environmental, and geopolitical implications of the United States? current dependence on a convoluted global supply chain.

    will result in significant economic activity through the utilization of waste
    carbon dioxide. The photo-catalytic reactors funded in the project will lead to
    novel methods to chemically store energy from the sun.  Each year, human activity
    releases 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Dimensional Energy
    envisions a future in which we can utilize this carbon dioxide as a feedstock
    for industrial production of hydrocarbon fuels and chemical intermediaries by
    harnessing the power of the sun. \n\nThis STTR Phase II project proposes to develop
    HI-Light - a photo-thermo-catalytic reactor platform technology that enables the
    conversion of CO2 and water to synthesis gas at a rate significantly greater than
    the state of the art.  The unique feature of the technology is that it uses embedded
    optical waveguides to evenly distribute light within the reactor, increasing the
    efficacy of the catalyst and ultimately the productivity of the system.  In Phase
    I a fully functional integrated prototype reactor was constructed, demonstrating
    continuous operation, and showing productivity in terms of the grams of hydrocarbon
    produced per gram of catalyst per hour more than 10x greater than the state of
    the art.  The approach solves the two major roadblocks in photo-conversion of
    CO2: (1) the semiconductor catalysts can only use photons with energies greater
    than their bandgap, which is a small fraction of those present in sunlight and
    (2) a large fraction of the catalyst material in these reactors is under-utilized
    due to sub-optimal light and reactant delivery.  Our unique reactor uses a patented,
    multi-scale approach to enhance light and reagent transport directly to the reaction
    site and makes use of traditionally unused photons to provide heat and enhance
    reaction efficiency.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on the development of a lithium metal battery using a novel Liquefied Gas Electrolyte. While there is an intense global effort to advance electrolyte chemistry for next-generation lithium batteries, these efforts focus almost entirely on liquid and solid-state electrolytes. In contrast, this project aims to further develop the use of a novel class of electrolytes which use solvents that are typically gaseous at room temperature and liquefied under moderate pressures. Phase I work demonstrated world-record cycling lithium metal with an average plating/stripping coulombic efficiency of >99.5% over 400 cycles with (0.5 mA/cm2 and 0.5 mAh/cm2 each cycle) with smooth and highly dense lithium deposition as observed through cryogenic focused-ion-beam characterization. Further, a world-record low temperature electrolytic conductivity of 3 mS/cm at -80 ?C for lithium-based electrolytes was obtained, far exceeding the state-of-art. Lastly, a reversible high temperature shut-down at +40 ?C, due to a decrease in electrolyte conductivity from salt precipitation, was demonstrated. This high temperature shut-down essentially eliminates thermal runaway reaction from occurring, making for a significantly safer battery.

    Further development of these electrolytes through this NSF Phase II grant will enable further work to increase battery specific energy to 450 Wh/kg, expand operating temperatures from -60 to +60 ?C, and increased safety with no thermal runaway while maintaining power and cycle life comparable to conventional Li-ion. This will be accomplished with further development of the electrolyte chemistry to improve lithium metal coulombic efficiency to >99.8% over 1000 cycles, increase the high temperature shut-down to +60~70 ?C, increasing cathode performance to higher voltages and cycle life, and the development of a high throughput R&D line which will offer high precision addition of electrolyte components to fine tune the chemistry. Because the electrolyte chemistry may use several common materials and manufacturing methods, there should be low cost barrier to entry and it is expected there will be significant cost reduction in volume production down to the goal of $100/kWh. The developed technology will be especially well suited for low temperature applications such as high-atmosphere, defense, and aerospace which frequently endure extreme temperatures and require high specific energy. Because of the superior performance at low temperatures compared to the incumbent, South 8 Technologies will first focus on developing the technology in these areas. As the technology matures, an eventual move into grid storage and transportation markets will follow, leading to a substantial decrease in emissions and reliance on imported fuels. The underlying fundamental chemistry with these new materials is a relatively new field and may potentially lead to significant advances in next-generation energy storage devices and broader technologies, leading to new industries, job growth and beyond.

    This SBIR Phase II project, the Engineering Design Instruction Software for implementing Objectives of Next generation standards (EDISON), will combine Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts together with engineering design, simulation, Augmented Reality (AR), 3-D printing, and real-world experiments. The project will create a collaborative platform for middle school engineering projects where students create, analyze, simulate, and construct designs for several types of projects like bridges, cars, circuits, simple machines, drones, and robots. This project will provide positive experiences with STEM and engineering in middle school, when many students lose interest in these economically vital fields. EDISON will foster STEM engagement and inquiry in middle school, by leveraging gaming, team collaboration, 3D printing, and augmented reality. The project will create engineering experiences that connect math and science content directly to real world applications to improve student academic performance in traditional science and math subjects. This work has the potential to promote effective integration of engineering in K-12, prepare students for future careers, expand scientific literacy, and engage diverse groups of students in STEM, supporting NSF's mission.


    This SBIR Phase II project will produce a collaborative engineering design platform for middle school, containing realistic design tools, content creation, embedded standards-based STEM assessment, and tools supporting prototyping and testing. EDISON provides end to end solutions for team-based engineering in middle schools and maintains engagement through gamification. This project will develop sophisticated tools that are lacking in existing engineering curricula, and support math and science standards alignment using model-based engineering, virtual design collaboration, and embedded tools for student evaluation. In this work the Phase I prototype will be extended by developing reusable design modules for circuit design, simple machines, aerodynamics, and programming. Testing tools using sensors and Augmented Reality will be added for real world data collection and analysis. Numerous modular standards aligned lessons and a content creation interface to facilitate EDISON?s transition to an instructional platform will be created. Finally, in collaboration with our University partner EDISON will be extensively tested and student outcomes evaluated in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classrooms using a combination of embedded, quantitative, and qualitative methods. The goal is to better meet the STEM instructional needs of educators and students with superior capabilities, engaging experiences, and easy to use tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to enable organizations - whether businesses, governments, or non-profits - to make more informed, more data-driven decisions. All organizations must decide how to allocate limited resources and do so in the context of meeting a set of objectives, such as profit, social wellbeing, or health. Modeling as a process and models as artifacts of that process allow decision makers to understand data through the lens of objectives and to then make decisions; data alone, no matter how much, cannot make decisions. As more aspects of the world are instrumented and captured digitally, the breadth and quantity of data will out of necessity require larger, more complex models to be built. Organizations will need a modeling workflow and supporting tools that scale with these demands.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the challenge of many users collaboratively building and maintaining analytical models that are consistent and reproducible while allowing for divergent and convergent change. This project will address the resource management challenges identified in development and the interactivity gaps identified in user testing of the Phase I prototype. The result will be a commercial software application for building models that manages code, data, and the evolution of both over time by many users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to search and understand documents across domains. It is a powerful tool for consumers and businesses to route, categorize and ensure key points of a document are seen. This makes it easy for overwhelmed users to search, link topic information to knowledge bases and extract customized data, even if they can't think of the right keywords.  Online search can infer the popularity or relevance of a page based on data from millions of users, including a user's location and what they've shown interest in; however, business users don't benefit from these features. Users view concepts in a summary linked to a knowledge base, allowing them to see summaries, triage documents on mobile devices, write rules to sort or filter them automatically, and see key data before ever opening the document.  This Phase II project improves information extraction systems by generating answerboxes from complex documents. Consumers will be able to quickly get the gist of formal documents such as consumer credit contracts, insurance policies, industry solicitations, engineering and other difficult-to-read documents. This innovation advances knowledge discovery, information retrieval methods, information extraction, slot-filling, and knowledge-base population.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project discovers unsupervised and unrestricted slots and fillers (attributes and values) to construct structured summaries based on keywords and underlying patterns in document collections. It extends the state of the art by not requiring a manually crafted catalogue of slots and complements supervised approaches by discovering new slots. While conventional Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches are effective on well-formed sentences, the techniques described here are effective for semi-structured content such as section headers, lists and tables. Additionally, NLP based approaches for fact extraction and text summarization are primarily lexical, requiring further processing for disambiguating and linking to unique entities and concepts in a knowledge base. This approach further advances the state of the art by eliminating these steps as it identifies keywords and links to knowledge base concepts as a first step in the discovery process. This concept-linking enables terms to explicitly map to semantic concepts in other ontologies such that they are available to enable reasoning and understanding.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the creation of a new tool that could prevent the loss of sensitive data stored in big data management systems due to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the proposed cybersecurity tool can allow organizations to audit their big data usage to prevent data misuse and comply with various privacy regulations. Recent attacks have shown that the leakage/stealing of stored data may result in enormous monetary loss and damage to organizational reputation, and increased identity theft risks for individuals. Furthermore, in the age of big data, protecting the security and privacy of stored data is paramount for maintaining public trust, and getting the full value from the collected data. The company's proposed tool will potentially have significant impact by addressing these important societal needs with respect to big data security and privacy. Based on customer discovery findings, this tool will also address an important customer need found in many different industries and has the potential to have significant commercial impact as more and more companies are adopting big data technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will commercialize a novel big data privacy, security and governance management tool that provides efficient data sanitization, attribute-based access control, accountability and governance policy enforcement capabilities for protecting sensitive data stored in big data management systems. In addition, the proposed product will provide novel data sensitivity aware intrusion detection capabilities. The Phase II research objectives are: 1) to develop an efficient attribute-based access control framework to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; 2) to develop data sanitization capabilities for complying with various regulations; 3) to develop a scalable audit log capture, storage and querying framework for increasing accountability for big data usage; and 4) to develop a data sensitivity aware intrusion detection framework to quickly detect potential attacks against sensitive data. These objectives pose significant research challenges with respect to scaling to big data without impacting the existing workflow of the companies. The company proposes to address these challenges by using novel code injection techniques combined with risk aware audit log generation and data sensitivity aware machine learning based intrusion detection techniques.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project centers on bringing enhanced independence, productivity, and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of individuals in the US who live with severe physical disability due to spinal cord injury or other debilitating neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Due to improvements in emergency medicine and increasing average age, these individuals represent a growing population that is underserved by current assistive technologies (ATs). The ATs being relied upon to carry out basic tasks are still primitive, offer limited versatility, and fail to meet end-user needs. Meanwhile, computers and internet play ever-growing roles in everyday life and are regarded as equalizers that allow individuals to have similar vocational, recreational, and educational opportunities. The Tongue Drive System (TDS) offers individuals with severe physical disabilities an intuitive and superior mechanism for accessing computer-based resources, wheelchairs, smartphones, smart homes, etc. TDS harnesses the power of the human tongue, which often retains full capability in these individuals despite losses of other functions, to drive human-computer interactions. TDS has the potential to revolutionize the current AT market in the US and around the world with an anticipated market size of $1B within its primary market segment.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project aims to bring this transformative and game-changing AT to market by continuing the design, development, evaluation, and expansion of a robust, reliable, and real-time TDS ecosystem. In Phase-I, the TDS hardware was redesigned and consolidated so that all signal processing functions were self-contained into a new standalone TDS (sTDS) headset system with a dual-band wireless link that can directly interface with a target peripheral by transmitting formatted user-defined commands. In Phase-II the designs for a solid and intuitive user interface, a smartphone app, and a robust and rugged powered wheelchair interface module to effectively control key target devices will be fine-tuned in the final stages of development in preparation for launch. The sTDS hardware/software/enclosure will also be tested and ready for manufacturing and meet the FDA regulatory requirements towards submission of a 510(k) premarket notification.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS or drones) to safely and reliably operate from moving vehicles and moving vessels at sea.
    There is an immediate need for this capability in many industries. In commercial fishing, drones
    will replace manned aircraft for fish-finding operations, radically reducing cost and risk. In maritime
    security, drones will provide surveillance around ships, including locating a ?man-overboard? in
    time to save the person?s life. In the oil and gas industry, drones will provide rapid-response to oil
    spills by mapping the location and extent of the oil slick, limiting the environmental and economic
    damage. In hydrographic surveying, drones will identify and geo-locate navigation aids, at a
    fraction of the time and cost of current survey methods. In commercial shipping, drones will
    inspect and protect shipping vessels while they are underway. In the transport industry, drones
    will delivery packages the ?last mile? from a delivery truck to a customer?s door. In law enforcement
    and border security, drones will operate from moving patrol vehicles while officers remain safe
    and mobile in the vehicle. These applications are currently difficult or impossible, but will become
    radically safer and easier with the proposed technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will advance the current state
    of the art in UAS/drone autonomy, to enable reliable drone operations from moving vehicles and
    moving vessels at sea. Shipboard landing is extremely difficult, due to the heaving and rolling of
    the ship deck, potential high winds, and the high precision control required during landing. Current
    drone technology does not facilitate landing on moving platforms; this prevents their use in
    maritime operations, and has become the main barrier to commercialization in this sector. The
    proposed research will develop a vision-aided relative navigation system that combines precise
    air-to-ship observations with onboard sensor measurements to accurately estimate the relative
    state between the drone and the ship. These relative state estimates will be used to dynamically
    route and control the drone safely on to the ship deck. Technical feasibility of this approach has
    been demonstrated during the Phase I project, which included demonstration of the technology
    in a relevant environment. The primary goals of the Phase 2 project are to improve system
    reliability, expand the operational envelope, and productize our system. The plan to achieve these
    goals includes scientific development paired with extensive testing, validation, and demonstration.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a manufacturing platform for opioid
    medicines. Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients
    suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics
    is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of
    their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly
    addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by
    certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will
    be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids
    by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy
    materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete
    production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States
    where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment
    in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental
    medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved
    efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will
    extend and enhance human lives.   \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project will develop
    a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the
    only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids
    is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently
    engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could
    enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain
    in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system
    based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide
    a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is
    ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further
    development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from
    laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification,
    and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements
    for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale
    and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make
    and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies
    with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical
    industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses low student engagement through a dynamic video delivery environment with a novel, real-time algorithm that adjusts the instructional pathway to each student's readiness level. According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.



    The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed to develop and commercialize an extendable/retractable telescopic structural wall for flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas.  Coastal cities and riverine communities are vulnerable to flooding hazards. These population centers tend to be located near bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general.  The commercial opportunity of the technology lies on the increasing worldwide need for flood protection. In fact, the World Bank estimates that 50 billion dollars a year will be spent worldwide in measures to mitigate this hazard. In U.S. only, floods are considered one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards with an estimated 7.9 billion dollars in damages and 82 fatalities per year. This technology, when developed, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. In Phase I, the feasibility of the concept was demonstrated by the ability of specimens to withstand the forces from three flooding scenarios representative of the targeted market sector: riverine, storm-surges and tsunamis. The Phase II project will focus on assessing the technical features of the walls based on lead-off customer sites. These will include the height of the walls, type of soil, and the hazard assessment, among others technical factors. Studies will be conducted on the local and overall structural response of the walls and the functionality of their mechanical components. Analytical and numerical models will be built and validated with tests on specific components and on full-scale models. The full-scale specimens will be subjected to storm-surges, hurricane, tsunami, slow-rising waters, and impacting debris forces. Robust theoretical framework along with analytical and numerical models and design guidelines will be built to reliably scale and replicate the technology for virtually any site where flood protection is needed.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project uses
    a new class of chemosensor films to continuously measure the concentration of
    heavy metals in a flowing stream of industrial wastewater. This will make it possible
    to know the concentration of several heavy metals at any given time so that treatment
    chemicals used to remove those metals can be metered precisely.  Current treatment
    methods typically rely on infrequent sampling of wastewater streams and time-delayed,
    labor-intensive laboratory measurements. Without the ability to measure continuously,
    wastewater treatment is adjusted based on periodic averages and estimated peak
    discharges.  To reduce the risk of regulatory violation, most wastewater treatment
    systems use twice the volume of treatment chemicals than might otherwise be needed.
    \ With the ability to measure metal concentrations continuously and automatically,
    wastewater treatment can be controlled in real time, cutting treatment chemical
    costs, solid waste costs and measurement labor costs by more than 50%.  Continuous
    measurement also reduces the risk of regulatory violations by > 90%, in turn reducing
    the potential costs of remediation and compliance as well as improving environmental
    conditions for the general public.     \n\nThe key outcome of Phase I research
    was the successful development of 15 new chemosensors permanently bound to a substrate,
    each with a unique response to zinc, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, lead, copper,
    iron, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel and tin. In Phase II, responses from
    an array of chemosensors will be fully characterized with a prototype instrument
    developed for commercial use in different industrial environments.  With that
    instrument, a mathematical model will be constructed to accurately convert sensor
    responses into scientific units of measure for multiple dissolved metals. The
    lower limit of detection for existing sensors ranges from 5 ppb to 50 ppb.  In
    parallel with analytical modeling work, chemosensor synthesis work continues to
    lower the limit of detection to 1 ppb, extend sensor life beyond 6 months, and
    broaden the portfolio of sensors to improve metal selectivity.  In the future,
    this new class of bonded chemosensors may be extended to determine the concentration
    of phosphates and many other species that are currently sampled occasionally and
    measured with lab instruments.  For applications where continuous measurement
    is important, this unique family of chemosensors offers great potential for real-time
    process control in a variety of industrial applications."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that it addresses the bandwidth crisis, the problem of transmitting an exponentially growing amount of data through a fixed amount of increasingly congested spectrum. The bandwidth crisis limits economic growth by constraining communication, and also poses very serious challenges for national defense and disaster response. Making better use of limited spectrum is therefore of high societal and commercial importance. This project will study a new approach, called spiral modulation, for achieving much more spectrally efficient communication than previously thought possible and thereby directly addressing the bandwidth crisis. Commercially, this could facilitate much more rapid data transfer, enhancing existing business applications and enabling new ones. Spiral modulation is applicable to any form of electromagnetic communication, whether wireless or wire-based. It could lead to commercialization across a wide range of communication sectors including but not limited to wireless, mobile internet, unmanned vehicles, automotive, aviation, and Internet of Things. It is a dual use technology with both civilian and defense applications. Ultimately, spiral modulation could become the core technology for the worldwide telecommunications industry.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project applies new mathematics to the problem of encoding information into waveforms for telecommunication. In current digital communication, information is transmitted using symbol waveforms constructed from sinusoids which have constant amplitude over each symbol period. This approach is known to produce a sharp upper bound on the highest spectral efficiency that can be achieved. By instead constructing symbol waveforms from sinusoidal waveforms with continuously-varying amplitude, spiral modulation bypasses the theoretical limitation on spectral efficiency. Building on prior Phase I research, this project will build an end-to-end hardware prototype to establish the implementation path and performance characteristics of spiral modulation. The research will progress in stages from waveform design and spectral efficiency measurement experiments, through end-to-end radio design in software, the hardware prototype development and documentation of best practices. It is anticipated that this research will show significant spectral efficiency advantages over existing signal modulation techniques. Other possible advantages for spiral modulation may also appear, such as greater tolerance for interference and phase distortion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the
    development of non-pharmacological interventions capable of improving clinical
    outcomes following spinal fusion surgery. Between 1998 and 2008, the annual
    number of spinal fusion surgeries increased 137% from 174,223 to 413,171 and the
    national bill for spinal fusion increased 7.9-fold. The greatest risk in spinal fusion
    procedures is failure to fuse, which can be particularly troublesome in high risk
    patients. Failure to fuse leads to poor surgical outcomes for patients and may result in
    chronic pain, secondary surgical procedures, reduced productivity, and/or permanent
    disability. In addition, failure to fuse results in greater clinical burden for physicians
    and increased cost per patient for payers. Lumbar fusions, in particular, have a
    cumulative reoperation rate of 19% over the 11 years following the initial procedure
    (BCC Research, 2010). The present project could result in the identification of new
    surgical devices and techniques capable of improving surgical outcomes, reducing
    complications, and eliminating costs associated with unsuccessful surgery. Osteogenic
    surgical device and techniques developed in the present project may also be used to
    accelerate bone healing and improve clinical outcomes following fractures of the skull,
    face, and long bones.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is to
    demonstrate in an animal model that osteogenic spinal instrumentation accelerates
    new bone formation and improves the rate of posterolateral fusion compared to
    clinically-accepted best practices in spinal fusion surgery. Innovative osteogenic spinal
    instrumentation (pedicle screws, rods, etc.) facilitates both mechanical stabilization of
    the spine and focused delivery of fusion-stimulating direct electric current (DC) at the
    fusion site. Application of therapeutic stimuli via selectively anodized pedicle screws
    accelerates the rate at which new bone is formed in critical regions of the spine such
    as the zygapophyseal joint and lateral gutter. The propensity of newly formed bone to
    create a robust, biomechanically sound fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also increased
    under osteogenic stimulation. Phase I results demonstrate that selectively-anodized
    electroactive pedicle screws effectively deliver focused osteogenic stimuli to key
    regions of the lumbar spine critical to spinal fusion. Results provide computational
    evidence for the technological and clinical success of novel osteogenic
    instrumentation in spinal fusion surgery. Phase II will confirm that the system of
    electroactive spinal instrumentation has the potential to accelerate bone growth and
    improve post-surgical fusion outcomes compared to gold-standard interventions
    utilizing a clinically relevant large animal model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project stems from addressing the problem of embedded energy in the manufacture of magnesium metal for use in vehicle light-weighting. Improving fuel economy by incorporation of the lightest structural metal, magnesium, does not save on total lifecycle energy consumed if the magnesium was produced using conventional methods. The most energy efficient and economical production method is known is a process technology that was commercially viable during World War II but not at any other time in history. The project innovation reinvestigates and reinvents this dated process, discovering the reasons for technical and economic failure. Domestic magnesium production using state-of-the-art energy-efficient practices will lead to opportunity and growth for downstream manufacturers that support a wide range of military, industrial, and consumer products such as car parts, electronic devices, titanium and steel production, and canned beverages. The economic and environmental benefits of the innovation in the long term will be ever more prescient given the unprecedented rise in use of magnesium metal over the past 100 years. This innovation creates a clean and economic route to magnesium production, helping to reinvigorate light metals industries within the U.S.

    The intellectual merit of this project is derived from a new paradigm in the condensation of magnesium metal gas produced by carbothermal reduction of magnesium oxide. Previously, shock cooling through a meta-stable temperature range was employed, generating pyrophoric powders that are dangerous and difficult to handle. This Phase II research uses both rapid cooling and controlled heterogeneous condensation for the formation of robust, oxidation resistance magnesium condensate. This process is executed in a novel and continuous condenser for high metal throughput. This effort is also made possible through the development of a reduction reactor technology that operates under milder conditions than previously used while maintaining high production rates. Total plant energy consumption will be at least 50% less than the dominant incumbent process. The Phase II project will result in a scaled ore-to-ingot pilot facility for the manufacture of magnesium metal as a raw material into manufacturing processes. Product quality, process feasibility, and proven scale-up will be demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from technology for automatic network configuration analysis.  As ever more devices connect to the Internet and rich services move to the "cloud," both the complexity of computer networks and their reliability requirements are rapidly escalating. It is no wonder that network outages and security breaches are common.  Yet another side effect of this complexity, which does not make the headlines but is equally damaging, is that network engineers are understandably fearful of making configuration changes, so networks are unable to evolve at a speed that keeps up with changing business needs.  The technology developed in this project will enable network engineers to validate correctness, security, and performance properties of their networks proactively, before errors reach the running network.  This technology has the potential to improve the robustness of critical network infrastructure that is widely relied upon, to prevent unauthorized access to resources, and to increase the pace of innovation.  The project will also provide insights into the largest "pain points" in modern networks and develop design and analysis techniques to address them.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project further develops the Batfish network configuration analysis technology.  Interactions with pilot customers as well as many interviews with potential customers identified the needs of the marketplace and how the Batfish technology can best be adapted to meet those needs. As a result, the specific goal of this project is to seamlessly aid network engineers in validating network behavior during the policy design phase. Drawing inspiration from how software is developed today, the company will extend Batfish to support continuous integration of network configurations and develop a series of analyses that can find errors in network configurations with minimal input from the network engineers. The anticipated outcome of these research thrusts is a technology that allows network engineers to easily understand and gain confidence in their proposed network designs and to iterate these designs more quickly.   The project will be driven by continued interactions with several pilot customers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the healthcare needs of the 27 million Americans and 300 million patients globally suffering with type 2 diabetes (T2D). These patients are desperate for a safe treatment that reestablishes glycemic control to augment or replace current management strategies such as metformin and insulin, which only slow the progression of the disease. This proposal provides a unique approach to T2D based on an orally delivered intestinal coating that mimics the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery. The potential commercial impact of this novel treatment is highly significant as the total estimated cost of diabetes management in the US is upwards of $245 billion, and rising. Overall, an astounding 1 in 5 US health care dollars is used for the care of people with diabetes. Therefore, major insurers are very interested in the reimbursement of alternative approaches for treating T2D, thereby lessening the national cost burden.

    The proposed project supports the further development of an entirely novel treatment for T2D based on new insights from bariatric surgery. The medical community has recently recognized that certain bariatric procedures involving duodenal exclusion confer profound and immediate benefits in glucose tolerance. Sleeve-type medical devices have provided clinical validation for this approach, but such devices are invasive and not currently approved due to safety issues. The investigators propose a non-invasive and safe orally-delivered intestinal coating which is expected to provide the same effect as surgery and implanted sleeves, but requires neither a specialist nor sedation. This proposal describes in-vitro and in-vivo experiments that build on positive results of the Phase I project, and drive the company towards human clinical trials. Specific Aim-1 is to optimize the active lead compound through evaluation of a limited number of rational structural variations. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of lead formulations in a chronic diabetic animal model. Consultation with leading endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, and material scientists has guided the selection of the materials and methods of this proposal. Completion of the studies outlined in the NSF SBIR Phase II proposal will accelerate clinical translation, bringing this novel treatment closer to patients in need.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II is to reduce the patient harm and financial burden created
    by the intensifying problem of emergency department (ED) crowding.  ED crowding
    is a threat to patient safety for high acuity patients and has been associated
    with avoidable morbidity and mortality across many conditions.  Concurrently,
    EDs are challenged to efficiently manage large volumes of low-acuity patients
    visiting with non-emergency conditions. The proposed electronic health record
    (EHR) integrated technology deploys novel machine learning algorithms that predict
    clinical events at actionable time-points in patients care pathways.  Characterizing
    the ED as a flow system, these decision support tools will concentrate on the
    root causes that exist at ED inflow and hospital outflow. This new foresight is
    expected to enable innovative hospital operational models that expedite patient
    progression (minimize patient waiting), improve patient safety, and directly translate
    to measurable cost-savings and/or revenue generation. The SBIR Phase II project
    should result in higher yield and scalable decision support technology while promoting
    the value of data-enabled science and engineering in healthcare. \n\n \n\nThe
    proposed project objective is to greatly reduce ED crowding by advancing the data-science,
    decision-science, and operations research that underpins our decision support
    technology. This new technology is based upon a novel combination of data normalization,
    feature selection, and supervised machine learning methods to predict clinical
    events that drives clear action to optimize hospital resources.  This includes
    a decision support tool that functions at ED triage (inflow) to predict risk of
    critical events to empower safe separation of service streams for acutely ill
    and non-urgent patients. A complementary tool functions near hospital discharge
    (outflow) to predict expected discharge time enabling hospital-wide prioritization
    of resources required to expedite discharge. This unlocks downstream capacity
    and removes a major ED outflow bottleneck that creates prolonged waiting. The
    proposed technology is innovative by design to be scaled, yet adaptive to hospitals
    individual patient populations, operational objectives, and risk tolerances. The
    technology is expected to further advance learning with providers about how to
    consume new predictive and explanatory information for decision support.  The
    specific Phase II objectives are to continue the development of the technology
    by: (1) integrating feedback into prediction output, (2) developing performance
    monitoring capabilities, and (3) driving systems-based management of patient progression."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from a potential reduction in the capital cost of wind turbines by an astounding 15x. The Company's patented, remarkably simple design also reduces transportation, maintenance, and land costs, and provides greater location and altitude flexibility. It uses the same aerodynamics as today's dominant wind technology, the horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), but with innovations that build on recent research into airborne wind energy generation. Multiple, 6-meter airfoils (they look like model airplanes) behave exactly like the outer tips of a conventional wind turbine blade, which is where most of the power is generated in a HAWT. The airfoils run along a rail- as if one captured kites and put them on short leashes - and a linear generator makes the power. The proposed research is a continuation of SBIR Phase I research and development that had demonstrated that these principles are scientifically sound. If successful, this Phase II project would drastically reduce the cost of wind-generated electricity, making it competitive with fossil fuels. It would thus be a completely self-sustaining commercially viable entity, creating jobs and generating tax revenues. By out-competing fossil fuels, it would use market forces to encourage renewable energy development, thus reducing energy-related emissions and improving national health, prosperity, and welfare. The project's light weight, low profile, and easy, flexible set-up may also have military and emergency applications that would help secure the national defense.



    The proposed technology captures energy through translational rather than rotational motion in the tips of the airfoils as they run along a rail tethered by bridles. Its major innovation is a patented bridling system that handles downwind forces (aerodynamic tip-over forces), which are the primary cause of the HAWT's mass and cost. Another major innovation is to run airfoils in an oval rather than a circle. This alters the math behind swept area, the key input for generation capacity. Because the oval's swept area is a function of length and height, rather than radius squared, this project can add capacity in many different ways, escaping the tyranny of building ever-bigger and -taller circles. The first objective is to design, test, build, measure, and refine a 100 kilowatt (kW) device. A meaningful-scale second-generation device will demonstrate the project's ability to meet performance, weight, and cost targets, while facilitating decisions about how to build far larger devices, and modeling their costs. The methods and approaches will continue to conquer challenges in five subsystems: structures, aerodynamics, power generation, control, and grid integration. The team, which includes leading experts in both academia and industry, will design subsystem options. It will convene to find the best system-wide design and construct the device, with many refinements along the way.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer and Research (STTR) project is a method to control invasive or otherwise unwanted trees and shrubs in an ecologically friendly manner with a biodegradable product. This will reduce the quantity of synthetic herbicides and/or synthetic herbicide adjuvants currently applied to control woody plants. This is especially needed near waterways where vegetation managers must choose between expensive mechanical removal or potential harm to sensitive ecosystems. Homeowners, landscapers, farmers, conservationists, utilities, and other customers will have a new product to control invasive trees and shrubs consistent with a mission to be good stewards of the environment.

    This STTR Phase II project proposes to follow initial successful Phase I demonstrations of an enzymatic bio-herbicide or herbicide adjuvant following the principles of termite biomimicry. The objectives of this Phase II project are to identify the mode-of-action, develop high- and medium-throughput bioassays in vitro and in planta, optimize the product formulation, and demonstrate efficacy on various invasive species in the field such as bush honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus), bamboo (Phyllostachys aurea), and potentially others.

    develop a resonant light detection and ranging (R-LIDAR) distance sensor based
    upon use of an optomechanical beam scanning element actuated at resonant frequency.
    The broader impact of this project is to commercialize distance sensing instrumentation
    that advances the development of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) by providing
    improved performance and order-of-magnitudes reduction in sensor size and cost.
    The development of RAS technologies could benefit society by increasing the productivity
    of economic activities in industries that include: mining, oil and gas, transportation,
    manufacturing, construction, agriculture, forestry, and defense. These industries
    are commercially significant and accounted for 24% of US GDP in 2015. Upon development,
    the R-LIDAR system is expected to make a commercial impact in a total addressable
    market for light detection and ranging (LIDAR) distance sensors that is expected
    to reach $739 million/year by 2018. Successful development of the R-LIDAR instrument
    will also pioneer opportunities for resonant scanning instrumentation in related
    optical applications that include microscopy, endoscopy, light machining, and
    display.\n \nResonant beam scanners provide robust high-speed and high-performance
    operation that address size, weight, and power (SWAP) consumption limitations
    in state of the art light LIDAR distance sensors. The key outcome of the SBIR
    Phase I project was the successful integration of a resonant optomechanical element
    into an R-LIDAR distance sensor, demonstrating a 125 X 125 pixel field-of-view
    acquired at a 20 Hz frame rate. The SBIR Phase II project seeks to advance R-LIDAR
    instrumentation through (1) development of low-SWAP robust scanning elements,
    (2) techniques and instrumentation that allow for improved signal to noise ratio
    and high-rate data acquisition from pulsed time-of-flight LIDAR sensors, and (3)
    increased ranging capability of low-SWAP R-LIDAR instrumentation. Successful completion
    of these technical objectives will result in a distance sensing technology that
    will be particularly useful for high-accuracy surveying and inspection applications
    conducted using small unmanned aircraft system (S-UAS), where size and payload
    constraints are acute."

    scale-up development of eco-friendly, cost-effective novel Electroless Nickel
    Immersion Gold (ENIG) surface finish with high corrosion resistance and robust
    solder joints for better reliability of electronic assemblies. Conventional ENIG
    currently available in the market is prone to black-pad defects (hyper-corrosion
    related failures) associated with de-wetting of solder. ENIG also suffers from
    brittle solder joint failures. Due to these reasons, there are field failures
    and reliability concerns of electronic assemblies - component disconnection which
    lead to overall malfunction of electronic assemblies. Moreover, most ENIG manufacturers/suppliers
    provide cyanide-based gold chemistry which has health and ecological hazards.
    The novel ENIG eliminates black pads- corrosion related issues, achieves robust
    solder joints and provides improved quality and reliability of electronic assembly.
    Also, it uses cyanide-free chemistry for immersion gold process making it eco-friendly.
    This allows manufacturers to consume eco-friendly product while avoiding major
    field failures and resulting consequences. This new technology would be potential
    replacement for existing ENIG (with market value roughly about 2-3 billion USD/year).
    \n\nThe primary focus of the project is to eliminate black-pad related failures
    and lead to robust, high quality and reliable solder joints for electronic assemblies.
    The root cause of black-pad defects has been identified as hyper corrosion activity
    at gold and nickel-phosphorous interface which involves nickel depletion and an
    enrichment of phosphorous in localized areas. During Phase I, interfacial engineering
    approach had been used to successfully eliminate black pads by achieving marked
    improvement in corrosion resistance. This has led to robust solder joints and
    elimination of brittle failures. In Phase II, the focus will be to scale-up development,
    optimize the product/chemistries and carry out further reliability testing. The
    main goal would be the rapid commercialization of novel ENIG into the market.
    This will involve development of the chemistries/process parameters for replenishing
    solution to make it market ready, economical and efficient for customers, further
    chemical testing for quality compliance (shelf life, quality standards, etc.)
    as well as reliability testing. Reliability testing will involve real world scenarios

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and apply machine learning statistical tools to Internet of Things (IoT) water delivery and water quality sensors. This will enable prediction and preemptive response to water point failures. The resilience of these environmental services is dependent upon credible and continuous indicators of reliability, leveraged by funding agencies to incentivize performance among service providers. In many locations, these service providers are utilities providing access to clean water, safe sanitation, and reliable energy. However, in some rural areas, there remains a significant gap between the intent of service providers and the impacts measured over time. Achieving the SBIR Phase II core objectives will help close the loop on effective and clean water delivery.  IoT sensors and services will address one of the most critical public health gaps by enabling delivery of reliable and safe water.

    IoT solutions for this environment may help address these information asymmetries and enable improved decisions and response. However, given the remote and power constrained environments and the high degree of variability between fixed infrastructure including age, materials, pipe diameters, power quality, rotating equipment vendors (pumps and generators), servicing, and functionality, any IOT solution would have to either be bespoke engineering, or compensate for these site-wise complexities through analytics. Instead, our SBIR II approach is to develop universal, solar powered cellular and satellite IOT hardware for each service type, and addresses site complexities through cloud-based sensor fusion and statistical learning. In this way, we significantly reduce hardware and logistical costs, and provide value to our customers through service delivery analytics. In Phase I, we demonstrated the application of simple sensors and sophisticated machine learning to identify off-nominal service delivery across a cohort of water pumps of various designs. We developed a universal electrical borehole sensor compatible with disparate fixed infrastructure, and we demonstrated solving the problem of heterogeneous customer hardware with a homogeneous sensor platform and adaptive machine learning backend.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will accelerate the adoption of data intensive precision agriculture, increasing yields while decreasing farm inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides. This project removes the software bottleneck (time and labor) in processing large aerial surveys taken by Unmanned Aerial Systems, enabling a cost-effective and timely process to deliver actionable information to farmers. Using frequent high-quality aerial scans, farmers may optimize the use of fertilizers and more finely control the amount of pesticides and herbicides necessary to increase crop yield. Furthermore, farmers mitigate costs and losses by being able to spot problem areas, minimize the spread of plant diseases, and identify issues such as standing water, irrigation malfunctions, and persistent automated machinery errors in planting or cultivation. This project provides special benefit for rural customers having inadequate internet infrastructure by eliminating the need to upload massive imagery to the cloud for processing. The technology is part of a broad initiative in agriculture addressing the need for large increases in food production by 2050 in response to the projected growth of the world?s population to over 9 Billion people.

    This project will continue development of algorithms for on-the-fly orthorectification, stitching, and normalization of aerial image mosaics and their deployment in an easy-to-use software prototype. The Phase I already demonstrated industry-leading speeds for such image processing. The technology behind this research project is designed from the ground up to process massive data with less memory and increased speed relative to other approaches, enabled by a proprietary streaming image representation, that allows multichannel gigapixel and terapixel images to be treated as ordinary images. This Phase II supports new extensions to the software that simplify and accelerate delivering a stitched and analyzed map, such as prioritizing computation in regions of the image that a customer is exploring. This would effectively eliminate the delay between image acquisition on unmanned aerial vehicles and when it can be used. Crop consultants have identified this as a transformative capability, as it enables ground-truthing information derived from aerial imagery in the same field visit, saving time and labor. The performance gains in compute-limited environments supported by this project are a key link between new capabilities to gather information and a farmer?s ability to utilize it to increase productivity while reducing costs.

    to develop precision-guided delivery of drugs or diagnostic compounds to the site
    of damage in traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is quite common; every year, over
    10 million people worldwide injure their brain, and it is the most common cause
    of death and disability in young people. There are currently no drugs available
    that would limit the additional damage to the brain from swelling and inflammation
    after the injury or help repair the brain. The company's technology allows one
    to guide a drug to the injured brain and keep it there until it has done its job,
    while less of the drug goes to normal tissues. This way, it will be possible to
    use drugs that, while beneficial in brain injury, may do damage elsewhere. It
    also makes it possible to use new types of drugs that would otherwise not reach
    their target in the brain. If the company is successful in bringing this technology
    to the clinic, it may make brain injury victims better, and significant savings
    to the healthcare system may also be obtained. \n\nThe proposed project will develop
    a highly efficacious technology platform for site-specific delivery of drugs to
    acute brain injury. The main reasons for the failure of neuro-protective agents
    in clinical trials are lack of specificity and the dose limiting effects of the
    therapy. Targeted delivery can circumvent this problem. In Phase I, the company
    described a novel peptide, CAQK, which specifically delivers various types of
    payloads to sites of brain injury from systemic administration. Developing improved
    variants of this peptide with high affinity and stability is important in ensuring
    optimal clinical translation of this technology. The objective of this project
    is to optimize the delivery platform by exploring different modifications of the
    CAQK peptide, and to use high throughput screening of chemical compound libraries
    to search for compounds that reproduce the CAQK activity. The outcome of this
    Phase II application will be a panel of stable, long-circulating, high affinity
    peptides and/or small molecule chemical mimetics that can be used for targeted
    drug delivery to injured brain. The most promising compounds will be validated
    in animal models of brain injury. Transformative advances in brain injury treatment
    in the form of increased efficacy, reduced side effects, and ease of administration
    should ensue."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports the development of a technology to improve the way drugs are delivered in the body. Less than 2% of the dose of any medication finds its way to the place in the body where it is needed. The other 98% is either eliminated or, even worse, concentrates in areas where they can lead to side effects. This happens with all medications from daily anti-inflammatory drugs to the latest cancer therapies. If successful, this new approach will turn a regular drug into a medicine that is concentrated and activated only at the area where it is needed. This advance should increase the efficacy of the therapy and minimize its side effects. For example, the local drug activation can target chemotherapies to tumors with minimal side effects. Antibiotics could be delivered at higher local doses than is currently possible, eliminating local infections and limiting the creation of drug-resistant bacteria. Anti-inflammatory medications could be more powerful, improving the management of post-operative pain, potentially reducing the use and misuse of opioid drugs. Overall, this technology could reduce the costly burden of adverse drug events, estimated at more than $177 billion.

    To create targeted medicines, researchers rely on the endogenous differences between diseased tissue and the rest of the body (e.g., molecular markers or differences in enzymatic activity). Local drug activation provides a new path to create targeted medicines. The approach starts by injecting a biodegradable polymer at the desired site. The material contains exogenous chemical activators that do not exist anywhere else in the body. Then a drug is given systemically that is inactive until it comes in contact with the gel improving local efficacy and diminishing systemic side effects. Phase 1 results showed that an inactivated chemotherapy eliminated tumors in mice after only 10 days of therapy with minimal side effects. The Phase II project will expand the benefits of the local drug activation platform to other therapies, including cancer therapies and pain medications. The long-term goal is to show the applicability of the approach to multiple classes of drugs and increase their potential to improve outcomes for diseases that affect local areas of the body. If successful, this advance should enable medications for people who are too frail to receive them and enable therapies to work in combinations that were previously impossible due to dose-limiting toxicities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in reducing the energy consumption from air and gas compression.  In the United States, industrial air compressors consume over 12% of manufacturing electricity consumption, or 399 trillion BTU.  5% of natural gas production in the US is consumed by compression to move the gas to the end-user.  On a global basis, compressors driven by electric motors are estimated to consume 32% of the electricity consumption from electric motor driven systems, or 2,267 terawatt hours per year.  At $0.10 per kilowatt hour, this translates into nearly $227 billion of annual electricity costs for compression. Carnot's technology has the potential to reduce energy consumption from compression by 20% or more across multiple compression applications. By reducing the energy consumed for air and gas compression, the technology will reduce the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activity in the US and internationally.



    Isothermal compression has been thought unachievable due to the requirement of rapidly capturing the heat of compression. The Phase I project allowed us to integrate proven design elements from prior prototypes, along with a complete liquid recirculation and heat dissipation system, into a single platform. This project will build upon research performed under the Phase I project to bring our compression technology to commercial readiness. A 2-year research and development plan will be executed to address key systems engineering elements of the technology to achieve commercial ready status.  A combination of lab experiments, thermodynamic modeling, design, engineering, and benchtop prototyping will be used to develop a commercial ready system design that can be applied to a broad range of industrial compression applications.  Further study and exploitation of isothermal compression may lead to an ever-evolving field of application, potentially creating additional areas of research and learning.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address the challenge of fouling on membranes used in biopharmaceutical processing. The successful application of this coating would enable increase in the membrane lifetime and product yield of various production streams as less of the valuable compounds remain trapped in the membrane. This can increase production capacity for life-saving medicines, reduce production costs and, in certain cases, enable continuous biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Furthermore, functionalization of membranes currently involve significant quantities of environmentally harmful solvents, which may be leachable during usage of the membrane. This issue is avoided in the current project by utilizing initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) process which does not require any solvent. This coating technology can also be extended to other systems including wastewater purification, food & beverage production, industrial separations, and medical devices that rely on a similar functionalization.

    The objective of Phase II will be to demonstrate a commercially viable manufacturing process to produce surface modifications within porous membranes using the iCVD process. Previous work in this subject has focused on top-coats on the top surfaces of reverse osmosis membranes, but the chemistries utilized have never before been demonstrated within interior structures of the membrane filters. During the Phase II work, the performance of the coatings will be optimized by using existing deposition equipment to tune the coating chemistry and process conditions to maximize the flux and throughput by minimizing protein fouling. The other main technical goal of the work will be to translate the current batch process into a continuous roll-to-roll process that is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. The outcome of this study will be a proven coating chemistry that is effective and durable in the membrane application, and an optimized manufacturing process capable of being implemented within current standards of membrane manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project answers the call that science students go beyond memorizing facts to understand content on a deeper, conceptual level. In chemistry, this goal is particularly difficult to achieve because the underlying concepts describe the behaviors of particles that are not directly observable to students. College instructors are also under added pressure to transform their teaching methods to help ensure student retention and success. In the subject area of organic chemistry, this transformation is even more important, due to the relatively high fail-rate in the course, especially for under-represented minorities and first generation students. The mobile learning tools and data collection platform in this project would help to solve both of these issues with an innovative method for intuitive learning and assessment which helps to make molecules and reactions come alive with game-based mobile applications. The game apps are playable by students of all ages, so the concepts of organic chemistry, as well as other science courses, become familiar and accessible as early as middle school. The broader vision is to open the pipeline for students to progress into STEM careers which have been difficult to reach in the past.

    This project makes the theoretical touchable for organic chemistry students by building mobile game-based learning tools based on mechanisms, a key underlying concept used to teaching the course. This project will produce the Mechanisms suite of game apps, and bring an intuitive, tactile interface to learning chemistry. The research and development of this phase of the project will expand the user interaction model from Phase I to multiple modules of content for students. The data from the mobile learning tools will be synthesized with machine learning techniques to create an adaptive method to ensure the applications provide the appropriate level of challenge to the student learner. Clinical and longitudinal efficacy studies will be part of the research effort as the game modules are developed and released. The data platform will be optimized to integrate with multiple learning management systems and to be readily expandable to subjects beyond organic chemistry. The dashboard of the platform will allow both instructors and students to access the data and inform learning processes to achieve greater comprehension and success in the course. Commercialization will be achieved through direct-to-student downloads, subscriptions of the data platform by institutions, and licensing the technology to courseware providers.

    Research Phase II project, if successful, will be to advance the development of
    a novel microbial fuel cell (MFC) system that generates energy from the wastewater
    being treated. MFC technology could revolutionize wastewater treatment for small
    and mid-sized breweries, fruit processors and other food and beverage processing
    plants. Over 40 billion gallons of wastewater are produced every day by sources
    such as breweries, juice processors, dairies, and other bottling plants. The company's
    microbial fuel cell technology is expected to offer significant economic/technical
    advantages for these companies by reducing their disposal costs, reducing the
    footprint of treatment facilities, and helping them to adopt a more sustainable
    process for wastewater treatment.  MFC technology also has potential in the low-cost,
    highly-efficient treatment of municipal wastewater. \n\nThe objectives of this
    Phase II research project are to construct and validate the performance of an
    innovative MFC technology in a scaled-up, simulated commercial-scale system and
    to validate the technical and economic benefits of utilizing this system to effectively
    clean brewery and fruit-processing wastewater at volumes representative of commercial

    processing plants are searching for an affordable and effective water-treatment
    option.  A promising approach is microbial fuel cell technology; however, significant
    technical/economic challenges have prevented commercialization of this technology.
    During Phase II, the MFC technology will be scaled up and tested at near-commercial

    and separator components and highly efficient reactor design are expected to finally
    make MFCs practical for wastewater treatment applications."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is for the development of scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end-user moldable advanced composite materials for use in protective athletic equipment. Currently, protective athletic equipment and accessories must be produced using industrial manufacturing techniques that have high tooling costs. As a result, manufacturers produce a small range of predetermined sizes and shapes, which do not provide a custom fit for end users. In the case of athletic gear, there is a growing market for hard-shell protective equipment which can be custom molded for a better fit. Polyimine polymers and advanced composites offer a compelling blend of strength and malleability in order to create more user-friendly lightweight and durable advanced composites that may be shaped by the end-user. In addition to creating greater user customization, both the virgin polyimine polymer, and advanced composites that incorporate polyimines, are intrinsically recyclable in a closed-loop, low-energy, solution-based system. The total U.S. composite materials market is $25 billion, representing 36% of the global composites sector. Polyimine polymers and advanced composite derivatives will reduce environmental waste and increase manufacturing efficiencies across a broad range of vertical markets in the composites sector including personal protective equipment, aerospace, automotive, and infrastructural materials.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the development of the unique chemistry of polyimine polymers. Polymers can be broadly grouped into two categories, thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are strong due to the chemical characteristics of the plastic. However, once cured, thermosets cannot be reshaped. As a result, thermosets are neither repairable, nor are they efficiently recyclable. In contrast, thermoplastics, which are weaker than thermosets, may be molded and remolded. However, remolding requires very high temperatures. Polyimine polymers represent a new class of moldable and remoldable thermoset materials. Importantly, these polymers combine high rigidity and tough mechanical properties with mild molding temperatures. This Phase II research project will include scaled processes for the industrial manufacture of end user moldable composite materials that are a maximum of one-quarter inch in thickness and meet industry standards for limb joint protective equipment. The Phase II effort will also include a variety of types of material and mechanical testing, both in-house and at certified laboratories, in addition to extensive efforts at proving out manufacturability, as well as pilot production.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to increase global access to vaccines
    and reduce mortality associated with infectious diseases. As an example, Rotavirus
    is a major cause of severe gastroenteritis among young children and lack of vaccination
    results in 450,000 deaths annually. A thermostable rotavirus vaccine would create
    cost-savings for vaccine manufacturers, national governments, and non-profit vaccine
    buyers and enable market access in areas of the world that lack sufficient cold-chain
    capacity. Successful development of a stable rotavirus vaccine would not only
    have significant positive impact on global rotavirus immunization efforts, but
    may also revolutionize the general approach to vaccine delivery and distribution.
    This Phase II project will advance towards commercialization a novel platform
    technology that both stabilizes vaccines and enables novel delivery formats. This
    technology has significant commercial potential in that it can be broadly applied
    to numerous emerging and existing vaccines in the $24 Billion global market. \n\nThe
    proposed project seeks to leverage the unique properties of silk to meet the global
    need for robust, thermostable vaccines. Thermal instability is a long-standing
    problem in vaccine development. Despite efforts to improve stability, current
    formulation approaches do not allow product storage under ambient conditions.
    Temperature excursions during shipment and storage are common and result in wastage
    or administration of suboptimal vaccines. The use of silk fibroin, a low-cost
    biomaterial, represents a novel approach to vaccine stabilization. The goal of
    the proposed research is to advance the silk-stabilization platform towards commercialization
    of vaccines that do not require cold storage. Building upon successful Phase I
    results, advanced formulation optimization studies will define a final product
    formulation for rotavirus that is compatible with scaled manufacturing and achieves
    all storage and in vivo attributes necessary for a commercial product. Through
    process optimization studies, fabrication of a dissolvable thin strip for oral
    delivery of rotavirus will be translated into a scalable manufacturing process
    that provides an attractive alternative to traditional drying methods. Evaluation
    of stabilized rotavirus vaccine films in an improved animal model will enable
    validation of in vivo immunogenicity and offer insight into vaccine stabilization
    and oral film delivery more broadly."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a robust, in-line plasmonic sensor for the detection of mercury in natural gas. Mercury naturally contaminates natural gas at the parts per million levels and can corrode critical aluminum components in processing facilities. Heat exchangers at Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) plants have failed catastrophically due to mercury corrosion, costing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and injuring workers.  Current monitoring methods cannot operate at the high pressures found in the process gas lines, leading to inaccurate measurements and unreliable instruments. LNG is a growing share of global energy as natural gas replaces more carbon intensive fossil fuels. By 2020, 30 LNG plants will be operating world wide, for a total mercury monitoring market of $136 million. Mercury monitoring at petrochemical facilities broadly is a $216 million per year market.  Mercury itself is a neurotoxin and a global pollutant; our sensor has the potential to aid in efforts to detect and remove mercury before it can impact human health. Beyond mercury, plasmonic sensing is a novel technology with applications for a variety of chemical and biological species.

    The intellectual merit of this project derives from the utilization of a novel sensing platform based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of a gold nanoparticle film. It will build upon the success of the Phase I project, which demonstrated the suitability of LSPR sensors for the detection of elemental mercury vapor. This Phase II project will proceed along two objectives. The first objective will be to adapt the sensor for operations at high pressure; included in this objective is the redesign of key components of the system and the construction of a high-pressure test bench.  The second objective is testing the LSPR sensor in a natural gas matrix; preliminary results indicate that LSPR mercury sensors response well in methane, but the full range of response and lifetime performance will be investigated in this project. Upon completion of these two objectives, field trials will commence. The full system will be certified for use in a gas plant and demonstrated at a suitable natural gas plant. A commercial prototype LSPR based natural gas mercury monitor will be realized upon completion of this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called "hard" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.

    The coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call "self-cleaning."  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the expedited development of a novel non-surgical medical device and therapeutic treatment for the approximately 1 in 3 women over the age of 30 who suffer from urinary incontinence, two thirds of whom, in part due to notable deficiencies of available solutions, elect to live without treatment while their symptoms progressively worsen. Urinary incontinence, although a very private concern, has far-reaching physical, psychological, social, and economic implications. For example, urinary incontinence has been found to reduce health-related quality of life measures on par with depression, incontinence is the number one reason for admittance into nursing homes, and the annual cost to the US healthcare system is estimated at $25 billion. Through design and validation activities this project will demonstrate the functionality of a wearable device that provides discreet, comfortable, easy-to-use therapy for female stress urinary incontinence. The technological understanding gained through this work lays the groundwork for subsequent commercialization of an FDA cleared product that will enhance the lives of tens of millions of American women.

    The proposed project provides a new framework for wearable therapeutics by enabling the patient to treat incontinence via discreet surface electrical stimulation without interruption to daily activity. Current non-surgical care often involves electrical stimulation via intravaginal probe, a treatment most woman are not willing to adopt or maintain. This project builds on successful Phase I feasibility work in which a contiguous array of cutaneous electrodes placed proximate the perineal tissue to deliver sufficient electrical muscle stimulation to promote pelvic floor toning were shown to maintain this efficacy under conditions associated with continuous wear.  The Phase II project goal is to develop an incontinence specific electrical muscle stimulator to function with the electrode array.  The system architecture will enable manipulation of the therapeutic waveform to support future multi-armed clinical studies designed to test the efficacy of various treatment regimens.  The system will also track treatment frequency, duration and intensity to provide information to clinical researchers.  Activity will include design, prototype fabrication, performance testing, human factors assessments, iteration and electrical safety validation.  Refinements to the electrode array are also anticipated.  The project will deliver a device suitable for future evaluation a human clinical studies, FDA clearance and product commercialization.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enable a commercial implementation of holographic video microscopy, a fast, precise and flexible technology for measuring the properties of individual colloidal particles suspended in fluid media. This disruptive technology solves critical manufacturing problems across industries that work with colloidal dispersions.  Demonstrated applications include: 1) monitoring the growth of nanoparticle agglomerates in precision slurries used to polish semiconductor wafers where scratches due to slurry agglomerates are responsible for waste valued at $1 billion annually; 2) tracking concentrations of dangerous contaminants in wastewater streams; and 3) measuring the concentration of protein aggregates in biopharmaceuticals, a safety concern noted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in this $250 billion industry.  Holographic video microscopy is unique among particle-characterization technologies in providing comprehensive information about the size, shape and composition of individual particles in real time and in situ. Having access to this wealth of data facilitates product development, creates new opportunities for process control and provides a new tool for quality assurance across a broad spectrum of industries enabling safer, less expensive products for consumers while providing cost savings to manufacturers.

    The technical objectives of this project are: 1) to optimize the design of the underlying holographic microscopy system without compromising the quality of results; 2) to enable quantitative concentration determination including corrections for perturbations introduced by flow dynamics; 3) to expand the domain of operation to characterize non-spherical particles and 4) to apply machine-learning algorithms for automated robust operation.  Using holographic video microscopy for commercial applications requires adaptation and innovation in the design of the prototype instrument that was used to demonstrate feasibility. Streamlining the optical train will require advanced modeling and the creation of new methods of correcting optical aberrations to enable ease of manufacture. Additional improvements in design will include advances in improving microfluidic flow control to generate accurate concentration determination, to adapt holographic analysis algorithms for characterizing the structure of aspheric particles, and to extend analytical capabilities for turbid fluids. Finally, innovative machine-learning using neural network algorithms demonstrated significant improvements for analytical robustness in Phase I and will be extended to a wider range of applications. The Phase II effort will enable holographic video microscopy of real-world samples with typical measurement times of a few minutes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project includes new ways to inform, educate, advertise or entertain through a technology called projection mapping. This technology uses commodity video projectors to augment the surfaces of ordinary objects; applications range from advertising, events, and entertainment, to educational experiences at museums or schools, healthcare applications for rehabilitation and visualization, and simulation (e.g. military or employee training). Through multiple deployments at retail locations across the country, the company's prototypes have demonstrated that these applications will benefit not only the brands and companies that employ the technology, but also the end-users (students, consumers, etc), resulting in better engagement and faster learning when compared to achieving these same tasks through other media such as videos. Research performed during the Phase II project will allow the company to develop a scalable product and fulfill many deployments, bringing projection mapping to new markets. A free version of the company's software will also be available for non-commercial and academic use, enabling interdisciplinary research in fine arts and computer science. The R&D results generated from the research will be published and disseminated to the public.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a commercially viable and scalable projection mapping system. While projection mapping has a long academic history, this captivating medium still remains out of commercial reach. As learned from over 50 customer discovery interviews, retailers are shifting towards location-based experiences to increase customer engagement and sales. Many other industries have a similar need to attract attention and convey information, but without a scalable product that can be easily deployed and maintained, they lack the means to provide these experiences. To address this need, the company will develop hardware and software systems to enable captivating and immersive projection mapping experiences. The core of this system is in software: the developed algorithms will robustly calibrate projection mapping systems comprising any number of projectors/cameras, automatically align projected content to the scene and perform color-correction when the display surfaces are non-white/textured. These algorithms will be validated through standard benchmarks, resulting in novel, state-of-the-art practices. Additionally, these methods will allow for reusable projection mapping content, a critical feature lacking in existing software, as well as cloud deployment and monitoring. New hardware configurations will also be developed to achieve new uses for projection mapping.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in the field of healthcare.  The United States spends approximately $9,000 per person per year on healthcare.  Ultrasound medical imaging is a medical imaging technology that could lower costs by providing an alternative to higher-cost imaging techniques.  The technology created during this Phase II project is expected to increase the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound, which would in turn reduce medical imaging costs in the US healthcare system.  Furthermore, the company's technology is expected to bring ultrasound to more clinical settings and improve system-wide efficiencies in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  The technology also has commercial potential in the international market, with $5.8B spent annually on medical ultrasound devices worldwide.  Finally, by improving the utility of ultrasound, the technology will lead to improved patient care and may ultimately save lives.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop deep learning technology for ultrasound imaging in medicine.  Ultrasound imaging has numerous benefits including real-time image acquisition, non-invasive scanning, low-cost devices, and no known side-effects (it is non-ionizing).  However, variability in quality has encumbered its adoption and utility.  As a result, more expensive imaging is typically utilized, often exposing patients to ionizing radiation.  Our objective is to develop, improve, and test machine learning techniques, based on deep learning, to improve ultrasound acquisition and interpretation.  We expect this project will create novel technologies that make ultrasound easier to use and improve the quality of ultrasound examinations.  The end result will improve the quality, value, and accessibility of medical ultrasound examinations, will result in cost savings to the healthcare system, will produce improvements in patient care, and will support a sustainable business opportunity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of technology for the intracellular delivery of biomolecules directly into cells. This microfluidics-based platform has the potential to become an enabling technology for intracellular delivery, which may be used to accelerate drug discovery R&D by allowing reliable, efficient delivery of diverse material classes without having to engineer the material or the cell to natively uptake these molecules. Such capabilities could allow pharmaceutical companies to assess the efficacy of drug candidates faster than ever before, especially with integration into high-throughput robotic workflows that are already well-established and efficacious. The technology could dramatically reduce the time to market for new drugs by decoupling determination of a candidate's activity from the cell's affinity for the molecule. It also could facilitate a deeper understanding of biological processes and pathways. Initial studies with leading drug developers and academic laboratories towards this goal have been very encouraging, and, in the future, the platform could potentially enable robust engineering of cell function for cell-based therapies targeting a diversity of diseases including influenza, cancer, and even autoimmune disorders.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes the continued development of the intracellular delivery technology to address relevant applications in drug discovery R&D. New drug discovery is often hampered by the inability of membrane-impermeable drug candidates to enter the cell cytosol, necessitating exogenous materials for delivery such as strong electric fields or viral vectors. However, these materials tend to cause off-target effects or toxicity, presenting a need for a technology that can facilitate delivery without altering post-treatment cellular function. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a platform geared towards market adoption of microfluidic hardware as the standard method for transfection and intracellular delivery. During Phase II, the platform will be fully-characterized, validated, and verified in order to produce the consistent, repeatable results necessary to achieve market entry. In addition, research is planned to demonstrate the ability of the platform to support drug discovery R&D by developing the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system for use with this intracellular delivery technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will dramatically increase the efficiency of communications networks. Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enable the availability of a revolutionary manufacturing process for pharmaceuticals. The project consists of the development of novel process technologies, as well as the integration of these processes into an end-to-end continuous manufacturing line that can produce drugs continuously (24/7 basis). This is different from the current methodology that produces large quantities of drugs at discrete time points (e.g. large batch quantities are produced several times a year).  A working pilot plant of this process demonstrated significant operational advantages with a marketed drug-production time was reduced from 200 days to 2 days, plant footprint decreased by 90%, projected costs reduced by 50%, while improving product quality.  The impact on society will be considerable: patients will receive better quality drugs; drug shortages will be greatly reduced; and pharmaceutical companies will be able to manufacture and distribute their drugs in a much more cost-effective and efficient manner, allowing them to reallocate more capital to Research and Development (new drugs developed).  Finally, it will be possible to relocate manufacturing plants and jobs back in the U.S. (more efficient processes = lower costs).

    The proposed project builds upon a successful Phase I SBIR project, as well as five years of collaboration between a premier research institution and a leading pharmaceutical company aimed at developing a novel continuous manufacturing process to overcome the limitations of the current standard, batch manufacturing.  The first objective of this NSF project is to further develop two novel elements of a multistep, continuous manufacturing process (i.e. heterogeneous crystallization and electrospinning for solid dosage forms), so they run reliably under different operating conditions. This is important because commercial production requires that they perform consistently and reliably 24/7. Thus, these novel unit operations will be studied under different operating conditions and starting materials, while their design is optimized.  Success will be defined when the unit operations achieve: 1) maximal operational efficiency, 2) industry standard manufacturing capabilities, and 3) qualification to be used across the Research and Development manufacturing spectrum.  The second objective is to integrate these two units into a broader end-to-end continuous manufacturing process capable of producing high-quality pharmaceuticals on a continuous basis. The integrated process will also feature three unit operations on separation, filtration and drying that were developed during Phase I of this SBIR project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for a more effective glaucoma treatment by adjusting eye pressure based on disease progression for each patient. In 2015, the US glaucoma market is estimated to be over $2 billion and our addressable market, glaucoma surgical therapies, is estimated to be $534M. The incidence for glaucoma increases with age, and as the baby boomer population gets older, there will be a growing need for glaucoma treatments. To treat glaucoma, patients undergo lifelong drug regimens, multiple laser procedures, and invasive surgical procedures. However, even with all these treatment options glaucoma patients still go blind from glaucoma. The proposed novel design and approach to glaucoma will personalize the treatment for patients and remove the need for numerous and costly procedures. Most importantly, the personalization of glaucoma therapy will optimize visual protection for every patient.

    The proposed project will validate the safety and efficacy of a glaucoma drainage device to adjust and set pressure in the eye. Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and is only treatable by reducing eye pressure. Surgical treatments are unpredictable with suboptimal success rates based primarily on the choice of drainage site. The proposed novel device drains to a new area of the eye to avoid the complications and unpredictability associated with the current glaucoma surgeries. The device also can provide the first-ever personalized treatment for millions of glaucoma sufferers by fine-tuning pressure based on the needs of the patient throughout his or her lifetime. Phase I/IB studies have shown feasibility of the device with an adjustable component.  However, its efficacy and safety have yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, in this Phase II research grant, we will optimize the device for safety and efficacy and perform the necessary preclinical testing according to FDA standards to further develop the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new analytical chemistry instrument for rapid quantitation of residual chemical impurities in complex mixtures. The target application for this project is the detection of genotoxic impurities during early drug development in pharmaceutical manufacturing. The instrument to be developed uses Fourier transform molecular rotational resonance (FT-MRR) spectroscopy to identify molecules based on their three dimensional geometry, which permits high chemical specificity.  FT-MRR is a high-resolution spectroscopy technique that makes it possible to directly analyze gas mixtures containing a large number of chemicals without the need for prior chemical separation using chromatography - a time-consuming step of current analysis methods that requires significant technical supervision.  As a result, FT-MRR based chemical analysis instruments have the potential to speed up innovation for pharmaceutical manufacturers by reducing analytical development cycles from weeks to hours during the high-throughput drug innovation process.  Chemical analysis instruments using FT-MRR spectroscopy enable faster innovation in research and development labs with the added benefit of seamless method transferability to on-line process monitoring applications and routine quality control for final product release.

    The ability to transfer analysis methods into routine analysis is important to the industry goal of continuous manufacturing for pharmaceuticals.  It is enabled for FT-MRR in part (yet critically) by the two main objectives of this Phase II effort: the development of sampling automation for FT-MRR and the design of a cost-reduced, targeted FT-MRR system.  Concepts for both of these designs were successfully tested during Phase I.  The intellectual merit of this project is the introduction of a new technique for chemical analysis that senses chemicals based on the absolute molecular structure, with no orthogonal analysis required.  FT-MRR spectral fingerprints can distinguish molecular isomers, conformers, isotopologues, and even enantiomers.  With this kind of absolute structure information, FT-MRR can enable new studies that trace chemical pathways with site-specific isotopic ratio information and chiral detection.  Both concepts are otherwise very challenging with current technology.  The FT-MRR instrument to be built for this project combines recent advances in high-power, solid-state millimeter wave (mm-wave) light sources, low-cost microwave synthesizer integrated circuits, and high-speed digital electronics to implement a time-domain, Fourier transform (FT) measurement approach.  Standard methods for chemical sampling will be integrated to maximize the ease-of-use and robustness of FT-MRR instruments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of
    surgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and
    reduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000
    procedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of
    these surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into
    longer recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision
    surgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,
    while the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as
    the revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are
    avoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has
    the potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image
    guidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally
    invasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a
    novel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during
    surgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than
    fluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with
    surgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical
    inaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated
    the feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by
    showing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This
    Phase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a
    variety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)
    confirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an
    ergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a
    system prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus
    fluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these
    objectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,
    regulatory clearance and commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from the development  of a new class of graphical-media-design system that lies between today's 2D digital paint systems and 3D computer-aided design systems. This technology will allow architects, engineers, artists, and school children to create compelling 3D experiences directly from their drawings without extensive training. Furthermore, it will accelerate the creation of interactive 3D content and significantly reduce the time, cost and expertise currently required to create it. By bridging the gap between traditional drawings and 3D modeling, this project will provide the unique ability to reuse and "reproject" drawn strokes, thus enabling the creation of expressive 3D drawings with minimal effort. The technology developed in this project will help lower the barrier and generate new business opportunities in content creation for electronic publishing and for other creative professionals, such as architects, designers, and ad-agency art directors. Finally, this project includes specific outreach activities, through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, that will provide unique educational services to the local community, while simultaneously introducing this new technology to the world.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on making the creation of this new type of graphical media as intuitive and fluid as paper and pencil. This Phase II project will support system improvements - including user-interface improvements - to simplify 3D navigation for the consumers of this media. This will be needed for using this media in digital children's picture books, which have already been identified as early adopters of this technology as well as an important market. Another technical objective will be to develop a hybrid vector-raster representation, which will provide a wider range of artistic expression, while improving rendering performance of large scenes. A third objective is to develop stroke deformation algorithms to support direct manipulation of objects and characters to provide sketch-driven animation capabilities.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will pursue the full development of a novel system design architecture for thermoelectric generation (TEG) to recover exhaust waste heat from engines and convert it to electricity.  The effort will build upon Phase I achievements, which included a successful feasibility demonstration of a fractional proof-of-concept prototype and development and validation of a computer model, thereby proving the viability of this new system technology platform.  The technology enables efficient performance within a very compact and cost-effective form that also can easily scale in capacity.  The Phase II effort will involve improving subsystems and designing, modeling, fabricating, and testing a full TEG system for a passenger car application.  Furthermore, scalability will be explored by applying the TEG to a larger vehicle platform.

    the broader/commercial impact of this project lie in the fact that industry has found it very challenging to develop a TEG system design that meets market metrics of performance, reliability, compactness, and low-cost, particularly for automotive applications.  The proposed TEG system architecture, which includes a novel exhaust gas heat exchanger uniquely integrated into the remaining system, shows strong potential for meeting such metrics, and thereby achieving significant reduction in vehicle fuel consumption and emissions.  By penetrating the large passenger vehicle market, initial market introduction could easily range in the 100,000s and much more if the cost of the product is extremely low.  Broader opportunities to recover exhaust waste heat for transportation include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which may also be addressed by this scalable technology.  Other adjacent markets include stationary and mobile generator sets, solid-oxide fuel cells, and potentially, aircraft propulsion systems.  This commercial impact would greatly support national energy independence and greenhouse gas reductions.

    outcomes and higher costs for health care providers. In this application, our
    lead device, the SpineFinder, would improve success rates via real-time guidance
    of spinal injections at the patient?s bedside. The societal impact of a safe,
    inexpensive, portable bone imaging products includes more successful procedures,
    better patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs. Additionally, the public
    would benefit by an overall reduction in ionizing radiation exposure from X-ray
    and a subsequent reduction in cancers. The general scientific and technological
    understanding of acoustics will be enhanced through this project by a better understanding
    of ultrasound interactions with specular reflecting surfaces, such as bone."

    support the final development and commercialization of Symbios Technologies plasma
    treatment system to allow produced water in the oil and gas industry to be effectively
    treated, thereby allowing its safe discharge to surface waters or recycling to
    stimulate production in new wells, rather than being disposed of in injection
    wells. Produced water is the water brought to the surface, with or without hydraulic
    fracturing, along with the intended fuel products during extraction of oil, gas,
    and coal bed methane from formations underground. In general, produced water is
    contaminated with hydrocarbons, salts, and harmful microorganisms, meaning that
    it must be treated before it can be discharged or reused for agriculture and other
    purposes. This is an important environmental, public safety, and economic problem
    in the US. Research conducted during this project will be used to evaluate reactor
    improvements including process sensors and control systems, electrode geometries
    and surface coatings, degradation of contaminants in produced water, field testing,
    and techno-economic modeling. The anticipated technical results are that the Symbios
    plasma system will degrade hydrocarbon contaminants and kill microorganisms in
    frac flowback or produced water, leaving the waters suitable for safe reuse or
    discharge. \n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that
    it will facilitate cleanup and reuse of a critical resource, water, in the oil
    and gas production industry, with crucial societal benefits for protecting the
    environment, guarding human safety, and keeping domestic energy costs down. The
    proposed technology is based on an innovative, low-voltage plasma discharge that
    creates powerful oxidizing species for destroying biological and chemical contaminants
    in produced water. Symbios Technologies has developed relationships and executed
    agreements with key companies in the produced water treatment field, which have
    identified numerous near-term business opportunities and provided crucial insights
    into preparing the technology for commercial success during Phase II. The customer-centered
    emphasis on solving water contamination problems in the oil and gas industry,
    which was estimated to have a global market size of $45 billion in 2010, will
    result in a high likelihood for commercial success. The Phase II R&D plan will
    enhance scientific and technical understanding as well as commercial impact by
    addressing reactor improvements pertaining to corrosion resistance and automated
    operation for a market-ready system, treatment of microbial and organic contaminants
    in produced water, on- site testing, and demonstration of economic competitiveness

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop instrumentation that will allow researchers to elucidate fundamental interactions at the atomic scale that occur at high-temperature and various timescales.  From advanced automobile manufacturing to computer chips, virtually all developing technologies require processing materials at high temperatures to enhance their properties.  The proposed optical delivery system will enable researchers and manufacturers to efficiently study materials at unprecedented temperature, time, and length scales, and thus bring new products to market faster.  Furthermore, the system will provide engineers and scientists a new platform for rapidly advancing emerging technologies that are limited by understanding high-temperature and excited-state materials phenomena.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design, assemble and test an optical delivery system specifically suitable for nano- and atomic-scale characterization in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The proposed program will deliver a system with unprecedented ability to efficiently stimulate materials in the TEM via highly-localized photothermal and photoexcited modalities. The photothermal modality will enable agile, non-invasive, and ubiquitous access to TEM specimens, and enable studies of unique temperature and temporal regimes not accessible using standard resistive heating systems. The proposed integrated temperature measurement system will allow closed-loop feedback and control of the precise temperature. The excitation modality will enable researchers to image and characterize optically excited states of materials at the nanoscale. The proposed instrumentation consists of fiber-coupled optical heating and excitation channels positioned by a specially-designed nanomanipulator for accurate x-y-z positioning. In addition to the hardware development, appropriate software controls will be developed for the optical sources and the nanomanipulator system.

    game challenge where students work together within an active, simulated environment
    to collect and analyze data, construct explanations, then test and iterate solutions
    to a problem. Only 22% of the United States? graduating high school seniors are
    proficient in science. This is important due to the estimated 2.4 million unfilled
    jobs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) in the United States,
    to provide higher-paying STEM jobs to citizens, and promote a scientifically literate
    citizenry. Recent research supports new approaches for how to improve this scientific
    literacy, and states across the country are adopting new science standards to
    support this effort. The outcome of this project will support development of students'
    scientific literacy with a novel approach which utilizes cooperative, interdisciplinary,
    problem-based learning within a video game. Commercialization of this product
    will transform the process of inquiry-based learning by putting the tools in the

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide accurate indoor location services to users via existing mobile electronic devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology will bring many of the applications powered by GPS, like navigation, tracking and location-based advertising to indoor markets. We propose using a hybrid ultrasound and RF-based beaconing system to enable sub-20cm location accuracy within large, GPS-denied environments. Our approach is unique in that it is compatible with current smartphones by simply downloading an app. The system uses an infrastructure comprised of beacons, which can be powered through indoor solar energy-harvesting instead of requiring expensive electrical wiring. Accurate indoor location-aware mobile applications can enhance applications ranging from retail, healthcare and manufacturing, all the way to building navigation, asset tracking and aiding the visually impaired.

    The proposed project aims to develop a robust localization platform which can localize off-the-shelf devices like smartphones and tablets as well as low-cost radio frequency (RF) tags to better than 20cm accuracy in indoor locations that do not have access to GPS. Current indoor localization technologies for smartphones often fall short in terms of accuracy, especially in highly dynamic environments with obstructions. Our system utilizes energy harvesting beacons with an array of speakers to transmit time-of-flight ranging signals in the near-ultrasound spectrum. These signals can be recorded and demodulated in software by commodity smartphones, while being inaudible to humans. The research in this phase will aim to develop the methods and technologies required to streamline installation to support large facilities like airports and convention centers that would require tens to hundreds of beacons. This involves the development of a mapping and commissioning system as well as hardware beacon modules for integration of our technology into the products of third parties (e.g. smart camera systems, building sensors, etc). We will also integrate the ability to track tagged assets.

    wheel that solves the persistent issue of trench-digging that leads to equipment
    breakdown, down time, lost profits, and crop-loss. The broader significance of
    eliminating trench-digging would be significant savings for farmers, distributors

    a wheel that eliminates an issue that plagues the industry is the central goal
    of this project. The development of a sine wave wheel also potentially impacts
    other fields as the technology can be used in over one-hundred different industries.
    \n\nThe technical innovation of this project is creating a wheel that is non-circular.
    The wheel will exhibit the blending of multiple shapes in one design including
    a sine wave, cube, circle and hexagon. It will be approximately 4.5 feet tall,
    and weighing approximately 400lbs for use in the farming industry. The concept
    is to create two wheels in tandem where the sine waves are out-of-phase from one
    another. The front wheel would create a left-right-left path into the soil, much
    like the path a snake would leave behind traversing soil. The rear wheel would
    move in an opposite right-left-right configuration leaving a double helix footprint
    in its wake. The opposing wheels would push the soil back toward center, eliminating
    the largest issue plaguing the industry: trench digging. The sine wave wheel technology
    has already been scientifically proven on a smaller scale in the skateboarding
    industry to reduce friction, increase longevity, increase off-road ability, and
    increase speed. Multiple wheel iterations will be manufactured and subsequently
    tested in this project using off-the-shelf hubs within the industry and rubber
    tires. The wheel will not be pneumatic and will never go flat.\n\nThis award reflects

- abstractText: "Fuel burned for industrial process heat accounts for 20%-30% of all
    carbon emissions on the face of the earth. Yet no emissions-free solutions for
    process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel.
    Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates
    energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened,
    it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.\nThe impact
    of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high
    temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions,
    improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy
    supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons
    of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands
    of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA
    technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural
    gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged
    landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership
    role in technology to enable these societal changes.\n\nThis Small Business Innovation
    Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment
    in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature
    solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces
    are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes
    that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe
    maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These
    systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation
    ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are
    particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures
    condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  \nSkyven?s system-level
    innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal
    collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as
    food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular:
    (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless
    control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe
    stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature
    operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a
    real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering
    concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test
    time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space
    of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be
    integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without
    require rework of the existing control systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    viable real time optical imaging device to address the problem of failed first
    time vascular access.  Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive
    procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone,
    there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access
    has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain
    and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure
    rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.
    \ Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When
    PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access
    is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications.
    One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length
    of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3
    billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates
    occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve
    first time IV access. \n\nIn phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid
    Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access,
    and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported
    by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath
    needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming
    intra lumen placement.  The system needs to be cost effective, durable and acceptable
    to a multitude of diverse clinicians. The disposable adapter probe will connect
    to a hand piece that will tactilely enable the clinician to actuate rotation and
    advancement of the optical probe to acquire data necessary to create clinically
    relevant 3D real time images.  The data are transmitted to a control unit for

While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide farmers with a new class of biotechnology-based pesticides for more affordable and environmentally benign crop production by addressing an unmet need: an efficacious, selective and safe pesticide. The project will focus on a pesticide for the diamondback moth (DBM), a pest that damages Brassica crops such as canola, cabbage, cauliflower and collards.  It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known. If successful, this biotechnology platform will contribute to sustainable food production and enhanced biodiversity with minimal use of non-selective traditional pesticides associated with human health costs.  The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.

    The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications. The outcome of the proposed research would provide the first example of a scalable RNAi-based insecticide targeting Plutella xylostella or any Lepidopteran.

    This SBIR Phase II project demonstrates and clinically validates a novel, non-invasive imaging technology to detect diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.

    The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that unplanned outages of power generation gas turbines are increasingly occurring which pose a risk of $1.6 billion to gas turbine manufacturers across an average fleet of 500 annually on power services contracts. Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ. This innovation combines unique, wireless, passive, corrosion-resistant PDC-based resonators bonded directly on the blade surface along with high temperature PDC-based antenna for operating in harsh environments. The research objectives are to miniaturize & optimize the sensor utilizing  different PDCs; fabrication & validation of high temperature antenna; characterization of PDC material properties, microstructural changes, degradation of sensing performance, bonding mechanism evaluation after long term exposure to high temperatures (~1000C) in a furnace & burner rig. The prototype, including integrated multiple sensors, high temperature antenna & user data interface, will be operated on a rotating micro-turbine to demonstrate performance in actual operating environments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project relates to the notion of distributed manufacturing using 3D printing, where structural parts may be manufactured onsite, meeting on-demand needs while eliminating transportation costs and inventory storage.  Unique, one-off prints, such as may often occur in the medical industry are another virtue of 3D print technology.  For these reasons, virtually every major US manufacturing industry is exploring avenues to utilize 3D printing.  While 3D printing is unquestionably entering the mainstream of manufacturing technology, a glaring gap in advancing the industry is the simulation of the performance of an "as manufactured" part.  A common question surrounding 3D print manufacturing today is: "How do I know if my part will perform as envisioned?" The proposed technology brings an industry leading software simulation to the product engineer and designer to answer this very question, enabling engineers to predict part performance, prior to attempting a build. The speed and simplicity of the software solution is transformative, accelerating the adoption of this disruptive manufacturing technology.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the technical challenge of predicting structural performance of an "as manufactured" fiber-reinforced 3D printed part. Additive Manufacturing (AM) offers the product engineer or designer tremendous freedom to create parts not achievable by more traditional processes.  However, parts produced by AM are fundamentally different than those produced by conventional methods.  For example, a machined aluminum part is largely homogenous, while a 3D printed part allows for internal lattice (infill) structures.  A 3D printed part can also exhibit a multitude of process anomalies such as voids, delamination between layers, warping produced by residual stresses as the part cools, and, in the case of fiber filled plastics, fiber orientation that varies throughout the part.  Collectively, these features can have a dramatic impact on the ultimate performance of the part and must be understood by the engineer early in the design stage.  This project seeks to develop a commercial software simulation product that predicts the structural performance of a part produced by 3D printing, while optimizing the infill (lattice) structure for strength and weight. Speed, simplicity, and high-fidelity results are hallmarks of the proposed solution and are at the core of the value proposition.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will allow highly cost effective, 2-way communications to be delivered to machinery and 'Things' over extremely long and non-line-of-sight distances using underutilized frequencies and new hardware and software techniques. The resulting technologies will provide 2-way connectivity where cellular does not exist and where other techniques (Satellite) are too expensive. This will result in near universal availability of the Internet-of-Things at costs superior to legacy approaches and which are appropriate for applications typically seen in Internet-of-Things applications. Further, the work will have broad impact in allowing more balanced utilization of the radio spectrum which cannot be addressed (either economically or at all) with legacy wireless techniques.

    The proposed project will create a new system of hardware, software, frequency and operating techniques which will allow underutilized spectrum to be used to deliver 2-way communications to very remote machines and things. The work will build on our Phase I accomplishments to create production-ready designs of two new wireless systems, signal processing software to allow use of challenging spectrum while avoiding existing users, create the first instance of a cloud based infrastructure for automated control and coordination of our architecture, and, the creation of a basic set of deployment tools and techniques to support field operations. We expect to continue building a significant base of Intellectual Property as we pursue the work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the technology provides health care systems with a very accurate view of what their patients experience during health care encounters - what is going well and importantly, what specific problems are frustrating patients. With this insight, providers are able to quickly and efficiently resolve issues. Patients are increasingly active in deciding where they receive care.  As health care spending declines, providers find themselves competing for patients. To attract patients and drive market share, health systems must deliver not just excellent clinical care but also positive patient experiences.  Patients that have a negative health care encounter often choose to go elsewhere.  When they do, providers lose margin.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the industry need for better insight on how to quickly and efficiently improve patient experiences.  Surveys which are the norm in health care fail to deliver service failure details.  The company's software goes beyond current text analysis solutions by automating the classification of patient feedback based on the ideas and sentiment expressed by patients. These results are converted into precise analytics and displayed in dashboards so front-line managers can quickly identify problems and make rapid improvements in patient experiences.  Previously the company demonstrated the technical feasibility of its software by focusing on a narrow set of providers.  This research will refine the software so that it is capable of analyzing patient feedback across a wide range of health care organizations. What operational changes will have the greatest, positive impact on patient loyalty and market share?  Results from this project will answer that question for a broad range of health care organizations.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be an instrument that alleviates several
    current difficulties in the growth measurement of many microbes, especially anaerobic
    and other fastidious organisms. A large number of these species are naturally
    occurring in the human body, and have recently been shown to play critical roles
    in allergies, autoimmune diseases, dietary health, cancer, infection response,
    and more. The study of these species is considered by many to be the next frontier
    of modern medicine, especially as current approaches to managing infectious diseases,
    such as traditional antibiotics, appear to be losing effectiveness. However, current
    measurement technology is largely incompatible with the specialized environments
    and chambers in which anaerobic organisms must be grown. There is a large unmet
    need for better ways to measure anaerobic bacterial growth; this need is growing
    quickly as interest in the field increases. The ability to conduct high-throughput
    experiments in specialized environments will become critical as research into
    various human microbiomes accelerates, and demand for high-volume data grows.
    The existing market for high-throughput measurement devices is at least $300 million
    and growing.  This platform will allow for systematic studies of cell culture
    growth that can be accomplished easily and economically. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to develop and refine a miniaturized multi-well plate reader
    that measures optical characteristics of up to 96 cell samples for measuring growth
    of many microbial samples simultaneously. The continuing rise of systems and computational
    biology demonstrates a growing demand for large amounts of quantitative data,
    and the variety of microbes relevant to the human body necessitates such an approach.
    However, these measurement techniques are not universally accessible due to current
    instruments' complexity, size, and cost. This project will continue development
    of a miniature, simplified version of a device called a multi-well plate reader,
    expanding the availability of parallel growth measurement (and other metrics)
    to a wider array of researchers and environments. The first goal is to simplify
    the instrument's electronics, add an on-board display for clarity, and allow battery-powered
    operation. The next goal is to accelerate equilibration to any surrounding environment
    to allow proper functioning even in extreme conditions, by measuring a wide array
    of environmental variables at different points in space and time. The third goal
    is to solidify the device's mechanical aspects for reliability and stability in
    a shaker. Finally, this project will support the development of a fully-functional
    wireless interface for control and data management, allowing effective remote
    use in any environment.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome and is characterized by a dysregulation of the immune system?s response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden annually, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. Sepsis is highly time critical and every 1-hour delay in antibiotics is associated with a 3-7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Such a tool would ideally gather any relevant information very quickly and provide a probability of sepsis directly back to the physician in less than 30 minutes. If this tool were available, a lot of the uncertainty revolving around early sepsis screening could be minimized. Outcomes such as mortality, readmission rate, length of stay, length of ICU stay, hospital cost, and compliance to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Core Measures could all be improved by such a tool.

    The goal of the SBIR Phase I project was to establish the feasibility of a point of care sensor that can measure cells and proteins from a drop of blood for the eventual stratification of sepsis. In Phase II, work will continue with our manufacturing partners to design, optimize, and test a one-time-use cartridge and a portable reader for the simultaneous measurement of cells and proteins from a small volume of blood. The objective will be to develop a scalable technology platform, that can measure total white blood cell count, CD64 expression on neutrophils, and 2 proteins (IL-6, and PCT), simultaneously from the same drop of blood, and also be able to measure different proteins by changing the types of beads used in the assay. The goal is to allow physicians and healthcare providers to perform frequent measurements at the point of care, and to integrate the clinical and biological data to predict sepsis and organ dysfunction. The result of this project will be a fully functional reader and accompanying disposable cartridges for the measurement of these critical sepsis biomarkers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from group chat technology that enables knowledge workers to collaborate more effectively than ever before. It is the first tool built that empowers users to efficiently carry out both real-time and asynchronous conversations in the same system, with each user reading only those conversations that are important to him or her. In particular, the technology empowers teams to make decisions in virtual meetings that take place asynchronously over periods of hours or days. This is in contrast with existing group chat technology, where conversations usually end as soon as someone starts talking about something else. This ability to conduct long running, virtual meetings is invaluable for large teams that need to coordinate work across different locations and time zones. Large, distributed teams are fast becoming the norm for how organizations operate, as instant communication and globalization make such teams the workforce of the future. Coordinating the efforts of such teams is a huge pain point for companies, and this technology is a leap in the state of the art in this space.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has three major research objectives: scaling the technology to teams of 10,000+ people; faithfully translating the user experience to mobile devices; and developing techniques for serving the needs of diverse deployments large and small. For scalability, one major area is "presence", telling each user who else is currently online. Presence data naturally grows with the number of pairs of users, therefore much faster than the number of users, and the company will need to develop algorithms to focus presence on significant connections between users. Among the unique challenges on mobile, the often-limited Internet connectivity demands algorithms that remember data previously fetched from the server to avoid asking for it again, carefully balanced with getting needed updates to never show out-of-date information to the user; the immediacy required for a great chat experience makes both horns of this dilemma especially sharp. Serving diverse deployments demands techniques for making software updates routine and seamless, a practice recently popularized in browsers and mobile apps but rarely accomplished to date in distributing server applications such as that described here.

Commercially available nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems employ polymer membranes, which have inherent chemical and thermal intolerance and are therefore difficult to clean or cannot be used in all separation streams. Meanwhile, 12% of US energy consumption is dedicated to thermal separations, a number that can be cut by a factor of 10 with appropriate physical separation technologies. This technology has applications across food & beverage processing, pharmaceutical production, semiconductor manufacturing, and chemical/petrochemical refining.

    Creating nanometer-scale features on large areas (tens of square meters) will enable technical opportunities for a multitude of products and applications. In this SBIR Phase II project, the company is conducting process development, pilot demonstration, and scale up efforts toward coating graphene oxide thin films for nanofiltration membrane separations applications. Today?s membrane processes are limited by the selectivity and durability of the nanofiltration membrane. Improved selectivity and operational conditions from the material platform enables improved downstream processes, and new product development. The technology is tolerant to elevated temperatures, extreme pH, organic and chlorinated solvents, and high levels of oxidizers. Transitioning from thermal separations to membrane separations saves 90% of the required energy. Meanwhile, payback time is < 3 months when improving clean-in-place (CIP) protocol for existing NF processes. This is a game changer for the separations industry. Key separations of interest include desalting, whey concentration, sugar fractionation, fatty acid separation, nutraceutical extraction, pharmaceutical purification and black liquor concentration.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in a significant improvement in the performance, power, and cost of deploying machine learning (ML) solutions through horizontal platform technologies that enable many vertical applications. This improvement will accelerate deployment of intelligent systems and improve scalability through localized intelligence. Our technology automates hardware design, implementation, and deployment to Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. Our initial target verticals: Security and Surveillance, Predictive Maintenance, and Healthcare represent hundreds of billions USD in growth markets for IoT devices and substantially more economic impact through improved efficiency in deployment and operations and reduced societal costs. Improved performance, power consumption and scalability of these key technologies will lead to improved public safety, improved intelligence in home healthcare services, and more efficient manufacturing and energy systems through deployment of Predictive Maintenance technologies on key industrial equipment. Wide deployment of these technologies will lead to substantial energy savings and a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions, reduced economic loss due to negative events, improved scalability and response time to predicted or active negative events, and lower cost in deployment and operations due to low cost, low power, and physically small sensor systems.

    The proposed project focuses on design of high performance, energy-efficient platforms for ML applications, and associated design tools and libraries. Neural networks are heavily used for many machine learning problems but optimizing for efficient deployment currently requires extensive trial-and-error for the large design space of options. Our deep neural network (DNN) optimization framework applies bit-width optimizations, weight sharing and pruning automatically to reduce computation and weight storage demands by more than 10X, while analyzing quality of results impact and using fine-tuned retraining to minimize or eliminate accuracy degradation. Our high level synthesis (HLS) tool then translates optimized networks to hardware while applying pipelining, functional unit parallelism, resource sharing, and platform-specific optimizations. Together these tools automate and accelerate the process of analyzing, optimizing and implementing ML for hardware deployment, reducing time and required expertise for hardware design. Our deployment platforms are modular, composable platforms for small, low-cost deployments of audio/video signal processing, feature extraction and classification, systems control (e.g. pan-tilt-zoom cameras), and communications to decision-making or cloud services. We will extend competitive advantages from our Phase I project with features for solutions in the security/surveillance, predictive maintenance, and healthcare verticals, and tight integration of platforms, tools and IP libraries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to enhance precision medicine by reducing data processing time and cost, leading to faster results, higher genomic data processing throughput and, ultimately leading to better treatment of patients. Many diseases have their impacts locked in DNA data. Unlocking the data for an individual may provide a significant boost to human healthcare. By providing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data analysis in one hour, as compared to the current standard of several days, and at a fraction of today's cost, DNA tests can become mainstream and research can be accelerated. WGS data is becoming a key component in ensuring correct and timely treatment of vulnerable populations, including newborn babies, people with cancer and rare diseases, and pregnant women. Correct prediction and treatment based on WGS data will extend human lives and promote better quality of life by accelerating the development and broad implementation of precision medicine.

    The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to develop a cloud-based framework to accelerate whole genome sequencing data analysis.  This SBIR Phase II project creates a software framework where multiple industry-standard genomic analyses will be accelerated transparently to run orders of magnitude faster, while reducing computational costs by up to 4x. The proposed innovation solves the scaling, performance, and cost challenges of WGS computing through novel parallelism extraction and mapping techniques. The framework under development for accelerating genomic analysis has been implemented to focus on GPUs and traditional processors (CPUs). Using this framework, secondary data analysis programs can use all the computing resources present in a standard computing node (CPU cores; GPUs), leading to higher utilization of the system and higher throughput. The GPU accelerates the data parallel portion of the software, while the CPU is mainly responsible for the orchestration of data between CPUs and GPUs, load balancing across multiple accelerators. By providing this framework to run on the cloud and on-premise, users can scale to meet the exploding demands of the DNA analysis industry. The software generates exact results to industry standard tools and does not sacrifice configurability that is critical for users. This framework also will enable researchers and medical professionals to analyze several thousands of genomes simultaneously, leading to higher quality results.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to create an economical, light&#8208;weight,
    high performance Terahertz (THz) spectrometer to allow testing of air and fossil
    fuels for the presence of harmful compounds. A frequency domain THz spectrometer
    is capable of characterizing the different molecules and chemicals in a gas sample.
    Historically these spectrometers have been relegated to the laboratory because
    of their size and complexity but recent technical advancements have made it possible
    to build a spectroscopic THz sensor small enough and light enough to be flown
    on a consumer drone. The reductions in size and cost have opened the door to using
    THz sensors for emissions testing of ships entering U.S. waters or contaminant
    testing of fossil fuels at petroleum processing facilities. This is significant
    because the ability to analyze samples locally removes the time and expense of
    collecting and shipping potentially dangerous compounds (i.e. flammable compounds
    or pollutants) to a laboratory for analysis. It also allows detection and classification
    to occur on short notice and without the need to subject personnel to the local
    environment. \n\nThe proposed project will produce the first article of a compact,
    battery operated, autonomously operating spectroscopic THz sensor capable of mixed
    gas analysis to parts per million sensitivities. It will be constructed predominantly
    from economical off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf fiber optic components in a novel highly
    compact, light&#8208;weight form factor. In order to achieve the high sensitivities,
    the spectroscopic THz sensor will incorporate: high fidelity lasers from the telecommunications
    industry, custom designed and fabricated high efficiency, hermetically sealed
    photomixers, a folded, light&#8208;weight, carbon fiber sample cell incorporating
    patented 3D printed mirror technology and a patented optical phase&#8208;modulation
    technique that removes the effects of coherent detection. The instrument will
    first be employed for laboratory based measurements of sulfur-containing contaminants
    in gas flows. Upon the successful demonstration of the capabilities of the instrument,
    a first article will be used in initial testing and collaborative field work.
    Sales of a larger laboratory instrument based on the same technology will begin
    simultaneously.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

    This STTR Phase II project will focus on the development of cost effective, high temperature molten salt heat transfer fluids for third generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants with operating temperatures >700?C. In the Phase I of this research, an additive package was developed that formed an adherent ceramic oxide coating on 316/316L stainless steel at the temperatures >700?C when added to specific chloride salt blends and inhibit corrosion. The utilization of the inhibitor package strategy will enable the utilization of economical stainless-steel alloys in the CSP plants and would reduce the infra-structure cost. Such solutions will have a direct impact on the renewable energy market which would help to lower the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for thermal solar from the current cost of 12?/kwh to the target 3?/kwh by 2030. The scientific and technological insight gained in this project could be beneficial to many other applications, such as molten carbonate fuel cells, thermal energy storage systems, nuclear molten fluoride/chloride reactors, and other high-temperature systems that are susceptible to aggressive corrosion. Incorporation of the inhibited molten chloride salt in the CSP plants will also provide sustainable green energy, reduce water usage, create more jobs and offer U.S. energy independence and security. On a societal level, impact will be achieved by the continued delivery and development of educational activities based on the research topics embodied by this work.


    The core innovation in this proposed program is the development of a chemical mixture, an additive package that would minimize the corrosion of stainless steel induced by molten chloride salts at temperatures >700?C. The additive package reacts with the stainless steel and forms a corrosion inhibiting ceramic oxide coating in-situ when added to the molten chlorides at operating temperatures>700?C. The chloride salts are proposed to be the heat transfer fluids for third generation CSP plants. The feasibility of the inhibitor package strategy in a real world CSP plant will be critically assessed in this proposed research. A prototype bench scale molten test loop will be designed and built to mimic the flow conditions in a CSP plant. The effect of prolonged exposure to high temperature molten salts on the mechanical properties of the base metal under dynamic conditions will be studied with attention to the molten salt induced degradation of strength and toughness at elevated temperatures. The degradation behavior of the salt with the inhibitor package will be studied as well. Additional research will be performed to gain fundamental insight on the nucleation and growth of the ceramic oxide coating and its thermal and mechanical stability in dynamic flow conditions.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform intravenous (IV) infusions of biologic medicines into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. Biologics have improved the treatment of human disease. Unfortunately, their delivery is burdensome. The standard of administration of these biologics is often by IV infusion at low concentrations, which can take multiple hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) would necessitate concentrations much greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's microparticle suspension technology can deliver high concentrations while fully preserving the protein structure, function, and efficacy. Transforming the delivery of biologics offers advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies. Patients will experience less pain and discomfort, save time, have fewer infections, and have better access to biologics. Healthcare providers will be able to process more patients, decrease the chance of complications, and use fewer human resources. Payers will have decreased reimbursement costs. Biopharmaceutical companies will have patented product differentiation and the ability to develop otherwise intractable biologics.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop a soft atomization manufacturing platform for the production of microparticle suspensions capable of transforming intravenous (IV) infusions of biologics into simple subcutaneous (SC) injections. The standard of administration of biologics is intravenous infusion at low concentrations, which can take hours to deliver, cause patient discomfort, and increase the risk of infection. Although SC injection is preferred, constraints on SC volume (1.5-2.0 mL) necessitate concentrations greater than 100 mg/mL, which are often unfeasible. Solutions at concentrations exceeding 100 mg/mL are highly viscous (honey-like), making them difficult to inject and leading to unstable products. This project's gently processed microparticle suspensions can deliver high concentrations while preserving protein structure and bioactivity, an accomplishment not well-demonstrated with other microparticle technologies. This project aims to advance the readiness level of the innovation by performing process calibration of a bench-scale system, followed by developing and characterizing the resulting particles and suspensions produced on that system. With well-formulated suspensions, in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies will commence. The project will support the development of manufacturing capabilities towards a goal of transitioning to pilot-scale production. This project aims to offer advantages to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and biopharmaceutical companies.

    This SBIR Phase II project focuses on creating scalable Virtual Learning Assistant technology for automatic educational assessments using open response questions. Educational researchers and experts believe that the best pedagogies responsible for improving students' learning outcomes involve (i) open response questions assessments and (ii) one-to-one instructional tutoring. Students learn better when they are given an opportunity to construct answers in their own words instead of selecting from multiple choices and when they receive immediate guidance and coaching. However, these two pedagogies are very time consuming and expensive to implement, making them very difficult to scale. The proposed project will apply the most advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing to solve both these problems. Students will benefit from the interactive formative assessment that engages them in a natural language conversation. This innovation is applicable across the grade levels in K-12, higher education, and adult learning and across the subject areas including the sciences. It will facilitate implementation of more rigorous academic standards and make online education more effective. This innovation will improve students' learning outcomes, save teachers' time and reduce the cost of delivering high quality engaging education at a large scale.

    This project will create a new type of virtual assistant technology that is exclusively focused on education. The proposed Virtual Learning Assistant (VLA) will advance the conversational AI technology to create pedagogically rich learning and assessment environments for any topic in a content area. The VLA is uniquely distinct from general purpose virtual assistants in its ability to evaluate an open response answer instead of merely serving information. This project will investigate and create various algorithms for processing natural language input arising in an educational setting across different subjects or topics. The resulting mobile and web based product will allow teachers to create new high-quality assessment items with minimal input and assign them to their students. When a student answers a question, the VLA will analyze it instantly for linguistic syntax and semantics using statistical and deterministic knowledge representations. The VLA will generate not only a numerical score reflecting the accuracy of the answer, but also a qualitative feedback that will guide the student towards conceptual mastery of the topic. As part of this Phase II research, a pilot study will be conducted each year involving teachers and students to study the efficacy of the VLA and its scalability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to provide a solution to the problem of drinking water contamination by developing an advanced adsorbent for point-of-use/home filtration applications. Micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues, pesticides, industrial chemicals and other organic compounds present in water resources at trace concentrations of one part per billion and less, are recognized as a major factor of contamination. Consumers around the world no longer trust the safety of their drinking water due to the presence of micropollutants and other contaminants. These compounds are pervasive and can present toxicity at trace concentrations. As a result, consumers have significantly increased the non-sustainable use of plastic bottled water, now a $260 billion market. Current point-of-use filtration products are primarily designed to improve taste and odor, and are generally ineffective in removing micropollutants. CycloPure's technology has been developed specifically to target and remove micropollutants from water. This project focuses on the further development of the company's cyclodextrin adsorbent to improve the effectiveness of point-of-use filters. This material can be used as a drop-in replacement without changes in filter design. CycloPure's materials will allow households to safely use readily available tap water.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to identify strategies to develop a suitable form factor to incorporate CycloPure's high-affinity cyclodextrin adsorbent into point-of-use filters. The company's adsorbent is formed by reacting cyclodextrins, which are derived from corn starch, with readily available monomers in a single step process. During the Phase I period of this project, scalable reaction conditions were identified for production of the adsorbent in powder form. Flow-through applications, such as gravity filters, frequently require granular particles to achieve desired flow rates. Early activities will focus on the preparation of the adsorbent in granular form to demonstrate scalability and retention of removal performance similar to powder form. Thereafter, column studies will be performed in order to assess the removal performance of granular media under flow-through conditions at environmentally relevant micropollutant concentrations. Following identification of adsorption characteristics and appropriate flow conditions, a prototype point-of-use filter will be constructed and tested for the removal of micropollutants from tap water using advanced analytical techniques, including a combination of target and non-target screening approaches.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continue development of cutting-edge nanopore technology that will greatly enhance biological preservation of regenerative medicines such as stem cells, complex tissues, and organs. Such a technology has the potential to greatly improve the biobanking and transport infrastructure of healthcare for on-demand cells and tissues, improved mass trauma care and advanced personalized medical procedures. Biopreservation is required in regenerative medicine at nearly all levels in the acquisition of source material, isolation, storage and shipment of a final product to patient. Yet critically, the field lacks the ability to safely and efficiently preserve these tissues and medicines while maintaining high cell viability and function after cryopreservation, severely limiting product shelf life. Nowhere is the absence of a biobanking technology more palpable than organ transplantation, where the time window between donor and recipient (4-7 hours) is not enough to properly match donations, screen for pathogens, or transport long distances. Enabling the United States to safely bank organs at subzero temperature will significantly enhance national healthcare. The US faces strong commercial and competitiveness reasons to invest in all facets of regenerative medicine, including organ therapies. Cryopreservation solutions would indirectly enable significant savings to the healthcare system, the patient, and healthcare insurance companies with the cost savings from regenerative medicine treatments estimated to be nearly $250 billion per year in the U.S.



    The cytotoxicity of current biopreservation techniques is largely associated with inefficient cryoprotective agent and water delivery across the cell membrane during cooling leading to irreparable cell damage from ice formation. Phase I established a fundamentally different approach to cryoprotective agent (CPA) optimization by developing first-in-the-field bioinspired nanopores as transmembrane mega highways to facilitate safe and efficient intracellular delivery and removal of cryoprotective agents during cryopreservation and dramatically increase post-thaw cell yield, viability, and function. The pore-formers assist CPA loading at reduced temperatures to make up the functional loss of biological protein channels at cold temperatures, reduce the amount of CPA required to remarkably low concentrations, and expand the selectable range of CPAs, all while dynamically dissociating at physiological temperature to prevent open-pore toxicity. Further R&D effort will diversify molecular design, optimize lead molecules, scale-up production, and perform cryopreservation studies on regenerative medicines of major therapeutic significance such as stem cells and complex tissues.

With global demand for wood products expected to rise 60% by 2060, managed pine plantations will play a key role in helping to meet this need. By identifying and studying the genes that control plant development, particularly as they relate to cellulose (wood) production in the cell wall, the tree's natural ability to capture and utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) for more wood growth has been enhanced through genetic engineering. This technology will strengthen the United States' position as the leading producer and exporter of commercial wood products, i.e., pulpwood for paper, sawtimber for lumber, and wood pellets for fuel. Additionally, with advancements in the understanding of the pine genome, the work proposed here will stimulate the development of novel innovations in the field of forest genetics while the proposed genetically engineered seedlings help to address growing industry needs for commercial wood products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a more efficient approach to engineering high wood density loblolly pine varieties. In contrast to traditional breeding, which has seen a modest 6% increase in wood density improvements over the past 20 years, this work proposes to increase wood density in pine by 20% through application of a directed, "gene trait" method to genetically engineer loblolly pine by altering secondary cell wall gene regulation. The proposed research will utilize a newly improved pine transformation protocol to scale up prototype production of tree seedlings designed with patent-pending, cell wall gene platform technologies. Also, this work establishes a pine engineering pipeline using germplasm adapted to different selective environments. This will streamline the production process while allowing for faster testing and development of technologies that improve growth traits in multiple growing regions. Specifically, plants engineered with this method will be tested for their long-term wood quality characteristics in both greenhouse and field trials. The goal of this project is to establish a commercial scale production program for loblolly pine engineered seedlings, and prepare for field testing and ultimately commercial sales of the cell wall platform technologies that have been developed.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be substantial: a successful project would transform the construction industry, making it far more efficient by reducing legal conflicts, schedule slips and poor decision making. The proposed work will enable the fast and easy creation of 100% complete visual documentation of a physical space; this documentation can be generated many times throughout the course of construction. In so doing, the proposed project will allow professionals in the construction industry to track progress and communicate with their teams far more efficiently than ever before. A second outcome of the project will be the creation of vast, detailed, never before seen datasets of construction projects and real estate, allowing technical innovations in artificial intelligence and computer vision to impact one of the largest industries in the nation and the world. For example, systems could be trained to automatically spot safety concerns, augmenting the efforts of safety managers and keeping workers safer than ever before.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a fast, easy to use and cheap method to create photorealistic immersive models using off the shelf consumer hardware. Technical hurdles include validating the quality and efficacy of models generated with consumer hardware and automatic creation of routes through the 3D space without human annotation. Technical milestones involve using various sensor streams as well as other prior data to build these routes. With these hurdles cleared, advanced work may include automated analytics between and among 3D models of the same site captured over time. Because of the system's ease of use, it will enable the collection of large, totally novel datasets. The goal of the research is to produce a prototype that a layperson can use to create an immersive model of a physical site in order to document it with no annotation effort. The plan to reach these goals includes iterative software development against the hurdles listed above, as well as continuous user feedback to guide and refine development.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an instrument platform that will facilitate development and translation of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics that are based on a class of nanovesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, which are nanoparticles shed by cells, are being investigated for early detection of diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, from biofluids without the need of invasive tissue biopsies. The lack of tools and techniques to perform high-throughput characterization of EVs is limiting translation. The platform under development will enable an understanding EVs produced by cells. The global market for nanoparticle analysis instrumentation in the life sciences is estimated at $5.9 Billion. The EV market, which is a subset of this market, is rapidly growing, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.3% over the next five years. Biological nanoparticles are playing an increasing role in life science applications and better, target-specific, faster tools are needed to characterize them in a high-throughput way.

    This SBIR Phase II project will complete the development of an instrument platform to enable Extracellular Vesicle (EV) measurements and characterization.  The platform will include a customer configurable consumable, eliminating the requirement for an expensive custom robotic arrayer step, removing barriers to end-user adoption and decentralizing discovery. Also, long-term shelf-life of the consumable will be established. In addition, improvements into the imaging platform will enable visualization of the smallest nanoparticles, relaxing the complexity and cost of the platform and providing a functional advantage over competitive offerings. The platform will automate much of the workflow, reducing operator hands-on time. The resulting platform will enable EV measurements with 5X-to-30X less sample volume, detect 100X-to-10,000X less concentrated targets, and increase throughput by using a workflow that bypasses purification requirements needed by other techniques. The completion of these objectives will result in a life science research tool for researchers and industry working on EV-based diagnostics and therapeutics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a fluidic platform for selective bacterial and endotoxin removal from blood. This technology can potentially serve as a novel blood cleansing therapeutic for diseases such as sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening complication caused by infection. In the U.S., sepsis afflicts over 1.6 million annually and has an associated mortality rate ranging from 25-50%. Realization of this fluidic platform technology will address the broader societal needs of inhibiting sepsis progression and developing more specific and effective therapeutics for the treatment of human disease. Commercialization and implementation of the proposed innovation may reduce the hospital length of stay associated with sepsis, decrease sepsis morbidity and mortality rates, and potentially reduce the annual U.S. expenditure for sepsis. Scientific and technological understanding generated by this work has additional applications for other blood-borne diseases, such as HIV, leukemia, and Lyme disease. Ultimately, this technology will revolutionize life science research through inertial-based fluidic platform use, enabling new discoveries in cell/particle focusing phenomena and interactions that have profound implications for elucidating inertial focusing mechanisms and for the development of novel platform technologies.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes a novel approach to address the problem of sepsis through the direct removal of pathogens and associated toxins from circulation. Sepsis is the leading cause of death of the critically ill in the United States, costing over $24 Billion in treatment annually. The primary treatment for sepsis is system antibiotic administration, which is failing due to the rise of drug resistance and new, emerging pathogens. The research objectives of this project will result in an easy to use, efficient, and cost-effective fluidic platform for separation and removal of bacteria and associated toxins from circulation. This will facilitate the broad use of inertial-based fluidic platforms as research tools and for clinical applications, such as sepsis. The proposed research will 1) optimize fluidic platform design for clinical application, economical use, and workflow efficiency, 2) demonstrate efficient fluidic platform-mediated bacteria and endotoxin capture, and 3) confirm the biological benefits of the fluidic platform technology using a validated animal model of sepsis. Successful completion of these studies will demonstrate the positive biological consequences of direct pathogen and toxin removal from circulation and establish the commercial viability of the fluidic platform technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to advance the use of engineered cell-based therapeutics in the human gut through the development of technologies for the reliable and reversible colonization of the gut with therapeutic bacterial strains. Engineered cellular therapeutics are poised to become the next major driver of pharmaceutical innovation due to their potential for sophisticated behavior and modular design. The gut is an ideal entry point for deploying engineered therapeutic cells, as it serves as our body's natural interface with foreign genetic material. A key impediment to bacterial drug development for the gut is the lack of strategies for achieving predictable colonization across the wide range of gut environments that patients can harbor. Furthermore, tools for on-demand clearance of therapeutic strains to ensure safety do not currently exist. The proposed innovation will overcome these challenges and allow the potential of engineered bacterial cells as therapies to be fully realized.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop the technologies necessary to achieve predictable colonization of, and targeted clearance from, the human gut by engineered bacterial strains. Predictable colonization will be achieved through the use of a therapeutic strain that has been modified to consume a privileged prebiotic substrate that can be dosed alongside the strain to precisely control its abundance by giving it a competitive advantage. To ensure containment and enable targeted clearance, the therapeutic strain will be further modified such that it only can grow in environments where the prebiotic is present. This will allow for the generation of a robust synthetic niche within the gut that can be manipulated solely through the administration of this prebiotic control molecule. In addition, to enable the commercial deployment of these novel technologies, manufacturing protocols will be developed to ensure that a fully integrated therapeutic strain can be produced in sufficient quantities and stably formulated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop engineered brewer's yeast to produce hop flavor compounds during beer fermentation, so as to replace the need for agriculturally produced hops.  Using agriculturally produced hops as a flavor component poses several challenges: 1) hops farming is natural resource intensive, 2) flavors imparted by hops are inconsistent from batch-to-batch, 3) lengthy agriculture timelines decouple demand from supply, and 4) new flavor varieties are restricted by slow and capital intensive hops breeding programs. This project establishes a product development framework for engineering brewer's yeast to produce flavor compounds during fermentation that are matched to consumer preferences. The technology developed during this project will allow for sustainable, consistent, on-demand production of hop flavors, and, in addition, may be extended to additional flavors and other fermentable products.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop engineered brewer's yeast for production of flavor compounds that are ordinarily derived from hops. At present, the beer industry relies on agriculturally produced hops to impart organoleptically rich flavors and character to beer. Engineered yeast strains will serve as a drop-in replacement for conventional brewing strains, in that they both ferment beer and produce flavor compounds at concentrations desired in the finished beer. By applying an agile development framework towards yeast strain development, new brewer's yeast strains will be generated that produce flavor bouquets preferred by brewers and consumers. Genes that encode biosynthetic pathways for production of flavor compounds will be incorporated into brewer's yeast, and various gene regulatory programs will be tested that give rise to myriad flavor bouquets in finished beer. Strains will be initially evaluated in small-scale micro-aerobic fermentations and analyzed by GC/MS to screen for relevant flavor compound concentrations. Based on screening results, strains with desired target flavor compound concentrations will be used to produce beer at industrial pilot scale for evaluation by sensory analysis panels as a means of generating consumer feedback. This workflow will be deployed in an iterative fashion to optimize the performance of the hops flavor-producing brewer's yeast.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to allow more consumers to make use of assisted and autonomous driving systems in automobiles. Fully Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will reduce traffic collisions and enable humans to spend less time driving and more time on productive activities. Commercially deploying AVs requires a number of key technologies including sensing, perceptual systems, motion planning, and actuation. Our discussions with leaders and decisionmakers at automotive companies have shown that the development of robust, accurate, and energy-efficient perception systems is a major technical obstacle to creating mass-producible autonomous road vehicles. Of particular interest to automakers is scaling down the computational requirements of perceptual systems while preserving high levels of accuracy and robustness.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use deep learning to create perception systems that are (a) scalable across different computational platforms and (b) scalable across smaller or larger sensor sets. Specifically, the company will develop scalable systems from small compute platforms (used for Highly Automated Driving) to somewhat larger compute platforms (used for Fully Automated Driving). Further, the company will develop perceptual systems that scale from few sensors to many sensors. The goal is to "do more with less," advancing the pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency-accuracy and price-accuracy tradeoffs. The company has already engaged with automotive OEMs and suppliers to develop partnerships and to define metrics for success in this endeavor.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in its potential to develop a new mechanism for painlessly terminating atrial fibrillation.  Cardiac arrhythmia is one of the leading causes of death and debilitation.  A common means of terminating harmful rhythms is delivering a shock via an external or implantable defibrillator.  The pain from the shock is the number one concern for patients with implantable defibrillators, and because of the pain, an implantable option is not practical for atrial fibrillation.  The high-risk, high-reward research to be conducted under this project will significantly advance the field of defibrillation therapy and aims to lead to the introduction of a new class of implantable medical device technology.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and evaluate an implantable device that achieves non-destructive temporary conduction delay in cardiac tissues for the painless termination, and potentially prevention, of life threatening arrhythmias.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. More than 1,000 Americans die each day from sudden cardiac arrest.  The team intends to initially target the development of a device to achieve rapid and painless termination of life threatening arrhythmias to treat atrial fibrillation. The successful development of the proposed device has the potential to benefit millions of patients.  Additionally, by virtue of its painless modulation of arrhythmogenesis, the proposed device may well also terminate incipient arrhythmias.  The phase II project will develop and evaluate a prototype system.  It is anticipated that the project will result in a new implantable medical device that painlessly terminates atrial fibrillation.

    The proposed project centers around further development on the world's smallest 2-way communications satellites and associated ground hardware. Key contributions of this project include system and networking optimization and validation of the technology through end to end demonstrations. The system optimization component will involve the development of system-level models that capture the complex interaction of all elements, including dynamics, constraints, and objectives. The network optimization component will focus on the development of algorithms that enable seamless communications scheduling as the network scales to several thousand devices on the ground.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project spans commercial, scientific and humanitarian applications by extending IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity to remote regions without cell coverage and where satellite data is prohibitively expensive for vital applications including agriculture, energy, shipping, and weather. The satellites and ground hardware being developed in this SBIR Phase II project have been driven towards miniaturization and power reduction to enable a broader range of customers to take advantage of the network by allowing easy integration into their devices and easy-to-install autonomous ground solutions.  The unique launch economics afforded by the miniaturized satellites enable IoT (Internet of Things) sensing and data return at a cost 1/10th to 1/100th that of incumbent satellite data providers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to extend the function of windows by turning them into daytime sources of electricity. The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. 

    The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will be to develop a new tool to safely and nondestructively deliver genes and other materials into large numbers cells at the same time. New forms of therapies for cancer and other intractable diseases take advantage of a patient's own cells, re-engineered in the laboratory to target a tumor or other diseased tissue. However, generating these cells is currently inefficient, slow, and expensive. Patient-derived cells resist transfection using standard non-viral biochemical approaches of lipid delivery systems, cell-penetrating peptides, and high-voltage electroporation, requiring an engineering alternative. The proposed technology provides a safe, turnkey, and scalable technology with a potential transformative impact in research and life sciences laboratories and companies, representing a high-growth and high-value market opportunity.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes a new nanomaterial delivery system to introduce reprogramming agents into immune cells efficiently and with low cell toxicity. This project will examine how the proposed nanostraw design, transfection protocol, and cell preparation improves immune cell delivery efficiency, and optimize the process to achieve >50% transfection efficiency with primary immune cells. Market analysis has found this level of transfection efficiency would be transformative to researchers and clinicians using primary immune cells. The transfection protocol will be optimized and codified into a simple to follow set of instructions. A turn-key instrument will be developed to carry out these procedures for use by life science researchers, with reduced device costs through improved manufacturing techniques to be competitive with currently available methods.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing a safe and sustainable ink for
    the global ink industry. Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced
    annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum
    or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly
    used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and
    toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules
    capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms
    that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like
    sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered
    in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe,
    renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing
    packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating
    these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact
    of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. \n\nThis
    SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria
    as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project
    will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments
    for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria
    will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations,
    such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process
    in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and
    reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source
    of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide,
    wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly
    generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria
    strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products
    for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural
    pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the potential to help enhance disease resistance in poultry and increase yields due to the delivery of only healthy, fully vaccinated chicks to farms. These healthier chicks will reduce the need for antibiotics in poultry, aiding to combat antimicrobial resistance.  This technology has immediate applications in other food animal industries and fisheries, and allows for data capture on numbers of animals and types of treatments given. Broader applications would include any image capture and analysis that relies on analytics to identify target areas for delivery of substances to live animals or humans.


    This SBIR Phase II project will allow for the advancement and commercialization of imaging technologies for the use of screening and targeting live animals. This proposal brings innovation in the care of food animals allowing for producers to move away from flock health and focus on the care of individual animals. This will be a dramatic change for the poultry industry, but is necessary in the face of antibiotic removal to be able to improve the current vaccination efficiencies and screen chicks for health status. Individualized care is currently not possible due to the high throughput needed to keep pace with large scale commercial hatchery operation. The technical challenges this proposal will overcome include 1) the safe and effective handling of chicks in an automated system that can process 100,000 chicks per hour, 2) the development of imaging systems for health checks and target recognition, 3) the delivery of the appropriate dose of vaccine with the correct amount of agents (virus, bacteria, parasite, and other agents) while not damaging the agents during delivery, and 4) development of a system that is rugged and robust enough to survive in a hatchery environment.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide quick and cost-effective access
    to anyone seeking cutting-edge, electromagnetic, simulation tools for research
    and development. This will involve automating the most technically intensive tasks
    required to accurately, reliably, and efficiently design and prototype photonic
    and optoelectronic devices. Current simulation tools require everything to be
    set up by hand which, even for trained experts, is time consuming and error prone.
    Also, the computational design and prototyping of photonic devices involves too
    much trial and error. Our turn-key, on-demand, cloud platform will: (1) reduce
    design time by 50%, (2) lower the unit cost of simulations by an order of magnitude,
    and (3) enable first-time users with no prior training in electromagnetic simulations
    to get up and running with manufacturing-ready designs in a matter of weeks not
    months. Our advanced simulation tools will facilitate enterprises and entrepreneurs
    with bringing products to market in a variety of industries critical to national
    security, health, and education. Easy-to-use and affordable design tools will
    also reduce the need to fabricate and test as many iterations thereby conserving
    environmental resources. This is the next generation of computer-aided design

    of photonic and optoelectronic devices. Photonics, the science of light, underlies
    critical technologies in telecommunications, networking, photovoltaics, biomedicine,
    photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase II involves
    automating the deployment of finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations
    in four key areas: (1)large-scale shape optimization for devices involving tens
    to hundreds of degrees of freedom, (2) sensitivity analysis to assess the impact
    on device performance of manufacturing errors and predicting manufacturing yields,
    (3) launching simulation jobs using on-demand, scalable, high-performance computing
    (HPC) in the public cloud, and (4) seamlessly importing and exporting planar device
    geometries based on the standard Graphic Database System (GDSII) file format widely
    supported by electronic design automation (EDA) tools and semiconductor foundries.
    This will be made possible by combining advances in machine learning, nonlinear

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to establish a broadly applicable, breakthrough biocatalytic technology to produce an important class of compounds called chiral cyclopropanes.  Cyclopropanes are key intermediates that are used in the synthesis of drugs, crop protection agents, and high-value electronic chemicals. Products accessible using this technology have markets totaling more than $10 billion annually. If successful, the technology under development will create safer, cleaner, more sustainable routes to important chemical products that will lower cost by reducing the number of production steps, lowering the required capital investment, significantly decreasing waste. Replacing existing chemical routes with the more efficient and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed steps will also improve the purity of many advanced pharmaceutical intermediates used in the manufacture of drugs and crop protection chemicals.

    This STTR Phase I project proposes to build on the results from Phase 1 in which a highly efficient biocatalytic process for the manufacture of the drug ticagrelor was developed using a novel, engineered enzyme. We will create an expanded set of cyclopropanation biocatalysts with the capability to act on a wider range of starting materials, thereby broadening the scope and utility of this new enzymatic reaction. We will complete the development and commercialization of the process for production of the key intermediate for ticagrelor and initiate work to develop novel biocatalysts to produce ley intermediates for anti-viral drugs. We will also develop and commercialize a set of enzymes that can be used by drug discovery chemists to establish efficient routes for next-generation drugs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of software and monitoring system for the conservation of water resources and the economic sustainability of agricultural crop producers. Agricultural production uses a great deal of water. In California alone, 80% percent of all water usage goes to agriculture. As communities expand and drought conditions develop, the competition for scarce and expensive water resources has become intense. Growers need to minimize costs and water needs by making their irrigation practices more efficient. While new irrigation application technologies have reduced losses from wind drift, leakages and evaporation, large amounts of water are still be wasted as it washes through the soil past crop roots. The technology developed in this project will allow producers to track soil moisture movement through the soil profile and across fields. This will allow producers to develop irrigation strategies based on the unique conditions of their soil types and topography and reduce water waste. It will save producers money and enable them to stay in business and meet new governmental regulations regarding irrigation. Improvements in water management efficiencies and better crop management practices can increase crop production and uniformity, reduce food costs, and help preserve the environment.

    This SBIR Phase II project addresses priority challenges currently facing growers, producers, and agricultural scientists in effectively using water for crop (food) production. Soil and crop scientists have been examining the need for acquiring higher resolution moisture and temperature data throughout the root zone and across the landscape. A science-based approach is needed to optimally determine the number, location, and depths of sensors to accurately measure, and then model, soil properties for use in precise, effective and efficient water and crop management. Moreover, for perennial crops such as wine grapes, there also is a need to develop models and predictions relating these environmental conditions and historical data to crop quality and volume as well as long-term tree/vine health. The proposed technology uses novel visual analytics to organize the resulting massive data flows and novel predictive models to allow stakeholders to perform precision management of crops based on soil moisture conditions and other field conditions that have not been possible to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result from greatly improving mobile app user experience, boosting developer productivity, and speeding up mobile innovations by automating the mundane and simplifying the complex in Android app testing.  Apps are now everywhere.  They innovate almost every industry.  By making it easy to build high-quality apps, users enjoy better experience and developers enjoy better productivity, benefiting every industry and person that use apps.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to modernize the software development process by combining both program analysis research breakthroughs and big data technologies. Toward this vision, this project aims to build a unique product with innovative technologies to help developers automatically test Android apps. The product continuously tests apps across code changes to detect issues such as performance regressions, crashes, and memory leaks, as soon as problematic code is introduced. In contrast, existing tools often alert developers too late, after real users have been affected and many code changes have been merged, making it both stressful and difficult to find the problematic code. The proposed product gives actionable diagnosis by pinpointing what problematic code developers need to fix and explaining the why and how of the fix. It is thus much more intelligent and easy to use than existing tools.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of novel high-brightness fluorescence compounds (fluorophores). These compounds will find applications in flow cytometry, a laser-induced fluorescence technique that can analyze thousands of cells per second. This efficient technique is important for clinical diagnosis, and research in the areas of blood cancer, STEM cells, and drug development. In a flow cytometry test, each cell structure is stained with a known fluorophore that is conjugated with a specific biomarker. Thus, the population of all cell structures and types can be determined simultaneously by analyzing the fluorescence signals. Unfortunately, such analysis requires experienced engineers, reliable equipment, and high-performance reagents. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores will enhance the performance of equipment and reagents, and enable the detection of low abundant cell structures without complicated signal processing. In addition, these fluorophores will improve data reliability, reduce research and drug development time, and cost. These compounds also will simplify the design and reduce the cost of flow cytometry equipment, which will help to expand market adoption. The commercial impact of this technology is expected to be significant, as the market size for flow cytometry is expected to be $2.2 billion by 2018.

    This STTR Phase II project aims to establish a platform technology for the production of high-brightness fluorophores that can emit in various colors. In principle, flow cytometry could simultaneously detect up to 30 different parameters with 30 color signals. However, due to the issues of spillover (signal overlap), and auto-fluorescence (background noise), the current technology allows for just two- to eight-color analysis to ensure accuracy. These issues could be resolved in part by a complicated signal analysis, but this approach may be prone to analysis errors. The proposed high-brightness fluorophores are designed to overcome spillover by increasing the weak signals of low abundance cells. In addition, these fluorophores also may reduce or eliminate the need of autofluorescence background compensation by increasing the signal to noise ratios. A higher signal to noise ratio will enable scientists to obtain well-resolved data with more accurate conclusions within a shorter amount of time. This technology will allow the detection and sorting of low abundance cells, and will promote the progress of immunology studies, cancer research, as well as technology for early disease detection. This will enabling flow cytometry equipment to be used to its full potential for reliable multi-color detection, which will lead to better patient and research outcomes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project stems from the development and commercialization of a networked-based, easy-to-use, fast and accurate tool that will allow architects, consultants, manufacturers of green building products to quickly compare, manipulate and optimize lighting strategies, perform whole-building annual glare analysis and access recommended manufactured products as solutions, to help make informed decisions for integrated design. Daylighting is a crucial piece of the green building puzzle. With the appropriate tools, daylighting is arguably one of the most cost-effective methods of achieving high performance buildings (and happier, healthier occupants) throughout the design process. World-wide green building is expected to double every three years. The world's green building market is a trillion-dollar industry, moreover, the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. By 2018, green construction will directly contribute 1.1 million jobs and $75.6 billion in wages by 2018 in the United States. Between 2015 and 2018, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings in the United States are estimated to have $1.2 billion in energy savings. Green buildings use fewer energy and water resources; save money for families, businesses and taxpayers; reduce carbon emissions; and prioritize environmental and human health.


    This projects proposes to create robust software for measuring, analyzing, and for recommending solutions to glare in buildings. A novel dynamic tree parallelization architecture is proposed to manage complex, dynamic, and massive amounts of lighting calculations. This will include building the first commercial grade 3 and 5 phase lighting analysis engine. It will also produce a new generation artifact for creating and manipulating data for glare analysis. It will conclude with a validation study.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project will provide an engaging independent-learning
    platform which weaves science into an exciting story for ages eight to thirteen.
    The platform combines a time-travel adventure game, a complementary book, and
    in-game avatars for important scientists (like Albert Einstein) that can answer
    students' questions.  It is aimed at the need for educating more science and engineering
    professionals by tapping into children's strong interest in games to augment current
    science curricula that students often find boring and uninteresting. The story
    is about STARDUST (atoms) and its formation and history in the universe.  It engages
    students by taking them back in time to identify trillions of atoms they personally
    inherited from Einstein and the last T-Rex.  Besides school use, the game's independent
    learning and engagement allows distribution directly to children for recreational
    use, adding another avenue for science learning, and a sustainable business model
    for the Company through school and commercial sales.  The technology can also
    support independent learning in underperforming schools. The development of the
    scientist avatar artificial intelligence technology will have wide application
    for many other educational and training requirements.  \n\nThe innovation is a
    unique platform for independent learning about the sweeping science saga of atoms
    during the history of the Universe and Earth, and the connection of each student
    to that history through the trillions of atoms they inherited from prior beings
    like Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex.  The platform combines video games, a
    complementary fictional story book (based on the science) that acts as game introduction
    and player guide, and in-game avatars (like Albert Einstein and Henrietta Leavitt)
    that can provide verbal answers to students' spoken questions.  The artificial
    intelligence backing the scientist avatars includes learning manager software
    that guides student learning and provides assessments of progress in achieving
    pre-established learning goals. Four players cooperate in time travel adventures,
    exploring the human body, the Earth, and the Universe to find out what STARDUST
    is (atoms), how and when it was created (in the Big Bang and supernovae), how
    it got into Einstein, and from him to others (e.g., the carbon cycle). Excellent
    test results for the Phase I prototype game suggests a successful start at creating
    good player engagement. The project will continue to combine learning and engagement
    in 10 additional episodes with new scientist avatars including female and minority
    scientists."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from addressing the
    important hand gesture based input challenges of VR/AR (expected to grow to $150B by
    2020), Robotics and IoT ($135B by 2019 and $1.7T by 2020 respectively). This technology,
    if successful in mitigating the high technical risks, represents a huge leap in the state of the
    art in 3D hand models for gesture recognition and has the potential to be the industry
    standard for AR, VR, Robotics and IoT applications with broad societal impact in education,
    medical and healthcare. Its broader impact is further amplified by the potential in serving the
    needs of the disabled community in improving their quality of life by being better able to
    communicate, learn and adapt to their interaction needs.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase 2 project aims to significantly
    advance current 3D hand gesture recognition technology by developing a dynamic hand
    tracking model for gesture intent recognition. It is robust against occlusion and tolerant to
    variations in camera orientation and position. This research will result in a transformative
    leap above the current state of academic and commercial hand models and overcome key
    technical hurdles that have so far proven difficult to overcome. It solves the following key
    challenges and involves very high technical risks: 1) robust hand tracking while holding
    objects and 2) robust tangible interactions using objects without using any fiducial markers
    2) low profile hand wearable for touch interaction detection. This Phase 2 project will
    achieve these objectives by 1) data acquisition and hand-object pose estimation, 2)
    understanding user intents with enhanced tangible interactions, and 3) system validation
    and user testing.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be the development of a
    microbial process for the economical and sustainable production of a highly potent
    natural acaricide, which is a pesticide that kills mites and ticks.  Increasing
    wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne
    illnesses creates a tremendous opportunity for natural acaricides. The project's
    terpene target has long been known as a highly effective and safe acaricide; however,
    its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production. The aim
    is to develop an alternative manufacturing process for biosynthetic production
    enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the $1.6 B acaricide
    market. Because the target is GRAS and because it has been used extensively as
    a food ingredient for decades, there is a compelling safety benefit combined with
    its potent efficacy, which may spur increased spraying in public areas and private
    residences. Overall, this project will provide a new sustainable, cost-effective
    production route, thereby enabling acaricide commercialization. \n\nThis SBIR
    Phase II project will lead to sustainable, scalable, and economical access to
    a highly potent natural acaricide.  A commercial fermentation process will be
    developed by employing advanced metabolic engineering and protein engineering
    approaches for improving strain and enzyme performance.  Achieving these production
    metrics will enable formulation and commercialization of various acaricidal products,
    including yard/area sprays, which will allow better control of tick populations
    and halt the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.  In addition,
    this work will significantly advance the understanding of producing complex plant

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project, if successful, will be to demonstrate the potential
    of the technology to dramatically reduce the cost and risk currently associated
    with production of bio-based products, enabling ultra-low cost product development.
    The field of metabolic engineering historically has been limited in predicting
    the behavior of complex biological systems in vivo from simplified models and
    basic in vitro biochemical principles. In many cases, it has proven much more
    difficult than expected to integrate a well characterized production pathway into
    a living host and balance the complex requirements of both biomass growth and
    production. The technology under development is a first of its kind, truly scalable,
    high-throughput metabolic engineering platform enabling the rapid development
    of microbial production strains. This significant reduction in development cost
    enables the possibility to produce numerous specialty products that would otherwise
    not have acceptable internal return on development capital. \n\nThis SBIR Phase
    II project will develop a high throughput metabolic engineering platform that
    enables the rapid development of microbial production strains. The platform, which
    bridges a gap between current in vivo and in vitro bio-production approaches,
    relies on the dynamic minimization of the active metabolic network in the context
    of a standardized two-stage bioprocess. Metabolic networks are highly interconnected
    wherein each metabolite and/or enzyme can interact with endless others. This combinatorial
    complexity results in a huge potential design space, which is intractable to the
    kinds of systematic experimentation required for the development of standardized
    design principles. The global challenges in addressing such a large biological
    design space have persisted, despite the dramatic advances in, and decreased costs
    of, reading and writing DNA, high-throughput DNA assembly, and microbial strain
    construction approaches. Dynamic metabolic network minimization not only results
    in a design space with greatly reduced complexity, but also provides strains that
    are robust to environmental conditions. Robustness leads to predictable scalability
    from high-throughput small-scale screens or \"microfermentations\" to fully instrumented
    bioreactors. This project will extend the validation of predictable strain performance
    from high-throughput microfermentation to pilot scale fermentation."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a platform technology for point of care (POC) detection of disease biomarkers present in low concentrations in bodily fluids. This technology can greatly impact the current standard medical workflow by reducing the time-to-results from days or weeks to 15 minutes, allowing for disease screenings during routine doctors visits supporting early diagnosis and improved treatment monitoring. It will promote preventative care, and therefore lead to improved treatment outcomes, patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. This technology will be incorporated into a portable, low-powered device that can be operated in-the-field, in low-resource settings in the US and internationally, supporting better healthcare monitoring that is often absent in under-served segments of society. The first target application is the detection of liver cancer, a disease that, when diagnosed late, has an extremely high mortality rate and cost of treatment. The proposed system may aid in the screening and early diagnosis of liver cancer. Furthermore, due to the technology?s inherent potential for multiplexing, it may be possible to simultaneous detect multiple biomarkers for chronic liver disease (Hep B, C, and cirrhosis), increasing its applicability to a global patient pool of over 500 million patients.

    Medicine is increasingly focused on personalized and preventative care and hence there is an increasing demand for diagnostic tools that can facilitate rapid screening, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Most current POC tests on the market are lateral flow based and do not target high sensitivity applications like cancer biomarkers, which require quantitative results and are present in low concentrations in blood. The goal of this Phase II project is to develop a standalone diagnostic system consisting of a portable reader and disposable cartridges to rapidly diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via the quantitative detection of AFP. During year 1, a 20-sensor very-high frequency (VHF) biochip will be designed and fabricated, simultaneously the whole blood processing component of the cartridge will be developed and integrated to form an all-inclusive cartridge. A distributed standalone electronic system will also designed and tested in year 1. Year 2 will involve the integration of the reader components to form a standalone system, additionally the all-inclusive cartridge will modified to interface with the reader allowing for plug and play operation. The performance of the integrated system will be evaluated via detection of HCC biomarkers in registry samples and comparison to the current standard of care.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable significant improvement in the shelf-life of unstable natural food ingredients and enable replacing artificial with natural colors in a large portfolio of products of interest to the food and beverage industries. Consumer demand for all-natural ingredients in food has increased multifold, primarily due to health concerns. Despite the strong consumer demand, delivery and stability of natural food colors pose a great challenge for the food and beverage industry. This challenge results due to an inherent chemical instability of natural ingredients and due to their accelerated degradation during food processing and storage. But the current solutions are not cost-effective and require the use of synthetic additives and preservatives, which are not desired by the consumers. This project is aimed at providing an array of low-cost, stable natural ingredients that will improve the overall stability of the finished products both during food processing and storage. This will also address the unmet societal needs for healthy food ingredients and improving sustainability of food products.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop bio-based encapsulation solutions to improve natural food color and phytochemical stability in food and beverage products. Current solutions are sub-optimal providing limited pH (color), heat or oxidative stability and short expiration dates on food and beverage products. To address this unmet need, this project aims to develop encapsulation of natural colors and bioactives that will enhance the overall stability of a finished food product. This will be achieved by working on the primary objectives of this project: Selection and screening of the carriers and natural ingredients to be encapsulated, physico-chemical stability testing of the encapsulated ingredients, scale-up methodologies, stability testing in a finished food/beverage product, consumer evaluation and customer validation of the formulations. As a result of the proposed approach, solutions will be provided that will allow the food and beverage industry to replace artificial with natural colorants as well as significantly extend shelf-life of their desired food products. This will also benefit the consumer who is seeking natural health-promoting ingredients in what he/she consumes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in improving the performance of the computational back-end of a display system that delivers personalized information in public spaces. Currently, the primary method for an individual to receive customized information in public spaces is through personal devices. The heavy use of personal devices in public often leads to heads-down, isolating, and even hazardous situations. The delivery of personalized information through infrastructure can significantly improve these issues. However, the bandwidth requirements in doing so have been prohibitively high using standard computational architectures. This project aims to improve the performance of such a system, allowing practical applications that will broadly enhance safety, accessibility, transportation, and other areas.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on creating a scalable computational pipeline and architecture that will allow a display system to direct personalized visual information in real-time to large numbers of people. Technically, this involves computing, transmitting, and displaying image data for large crowds in parallel. The architecture takes advantage of the inherent redundancies in this application to provide a cost-effective solution. The goal of the project is to create a computational back-end capable of driving, in real-time, a system equivalent to thousands of displays.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a drug screening system that will accelerate drug discovery for several eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular edema.  This technology will fulfill unmet needs of small and large biopharmaceutical companies engaged in drug discovery for various eye diseases by reducing development cost, expediting preclinical research, and increasing the chances of clinical success.  From the socio-economic standpoint, this technology will result in the development of more effective ocular drugs that will decrease eye disease treatment cost. Furthermore, this model will facilitate more rapid development of technologies for the diagnosis of glaucoma and new surgical techniques in the management of this disease.  Overall, this screening system will accelerate the development of medications for eye diseases, enhancing the quality of life for millions of people.

    This SBIR Phase II project will address the lack of effective models for testing targeted glaucoma therapeutics and additional ocular diseases.  Currently, none of the available glaucoma medications target the eye tissue responsible for this disease due to absence of clinically relevant testing platform that incorporates this particular eye tissue. Presently, animal or human cadaver eyes are used to study and test the effects of medications on such tissue, however, these preparations are cumbersome and expensive. The proposed work will be the first-of-its-kind to engineer physiologically-relevant 3D human eye tissues utilizing novel cell culture methods along with microfabrication techniques and a microfluidic system. These 3D tissues will facilitate the development of disease-relevant in vitro model systems for understanding not only glaucoma but also diabetic retinopathy and macular edema pathology. This tool will help increase the success rate of glaucoma and ocular vasculature-related medications at later stages of drug development pipeline.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of a software platform for the engineering of living systems. Specifically, it will complete a software ecosystem that builds upon a core set of computational tools for the specification, design, build, test, analyze, and archive activities in synthetic biology and couple them with a rich set of interfaces to expert services (e.g., DNA synthesis, data analysis). The proposed work involves the completion of state-of-the-art design approaches and algorithms and couples it with the ability to create customized, modular workflows based on genetic circuit design, metabolic pathway modification, and genome engineering. The proposed work advances computational approaches in synthetic biology as well as innovating in the way that software services are monetized with biotechnology companies. The anticipated result of this work is a commercial software package and associated service agreements that can be deployed to both large and small biotechnology companies fundamentally changing the way that synthetic biology designs are conceived, designed, and physically created.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a software platform where the goal is to combine bio-design automation (BDA) software with explicitly integrated access to expert services in a workflow-driven software ecosystem.  The creation of novel living systems using biotechnology to engineer new medicines, materials, and fuels is frequently an ad-hoc process involving long iteration cycles, wasted resources, and sub-optimal designs. The software will allow for the automated specification, design, fabrication, test, and archival of complete plans for the engineering of novel engineered biological systems. This software includes mechanisms for specifying biological "rules," DNA assembly strategies, and automated generation of robotic instructions.  In particular, this effort will focus on the creation of genetic circuits, engineered metabolic pathways, and genome engineering.  The approach provides tools representing state-of-the-art advances in BDA while introducing novel methods of interacting with a large, diverse set of expert service providers. Further, the approach will empower novice experimentalists while enabling expert computational engineers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the production of enhanced-nutrition soybeans that have high levels of protein for use in aquafeed. Meat and fish consumption is rapidly growing due to increased world population and affluence. Aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector. Small wild-caught fish are used for aquaculture feed. Wild-caught fish harvests have not changed in 25 years and overfishing small fish jeopardizes the marine ecosystem. Aquafeed producers are turning to soy-based protein to replace fishmeal but soy-based proteins lack taurine and are deficient in methionine, two important nutrients for fish. To meet fish nutritional requirements, producers supplement soy-based aquafeed with synthetic taurine and methionine. In addition to added costs, synthetic taurine and methionine are produced from hazardous substances, and synthetic taurine has been shown to contain arsenic. Successful development of enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would reduce the amount of supplemental nutrients required in aquafeed, a $2.2B global annual cost predicted for 2020, and could save aquafeed producers 20% of their additive feed costs. Enhanced-nutrition soybean seeds would be an economical, healthy, sustainable, environmentally friendly and secure source of taurine and methionine for the rapidly growing aquaculture industry.

    This SBIR Phase II project will use a biotechnology approach to increase the essential nutrients in soybean seeds for use in aquafeed. Many aquafeed producers use plant-based protein, primarily from soybean, as a replacement for fishmeal. However, plants lack some nutrients required for normal fish growth and development. Taurine and methionine, two nutrients either lacking or limited in soybean, are supplemented to soy-based aquafeed, thus increasing feed-production costs. The goal of this project is to increase the levels of taurine and methionine produced in the seeds of a commercial-grade, high-protein soybean variety that has high feed digestibility. Molecular and biochemical methods will be used to identify soybean seeds with: (1) taurine and high methionine levels; (2) uncompromised quality and viability; (3) unaffected levels of other nutrients; (4) normal to higher-than-normal protein content; and (5) low levels of nondigestible compounds. The anticipated results are the production of soybean seeds with a minimum of 0.2% taurine (dry seed weight) and at least 50% more total methionine compared with control seeds.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to address a strong commercial and scientific need for operational synthesis of spatially consistent and temporally relevant historical and current high resolution satellite imagery for analytical purposes. The technology will contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge especially in the geospatial arena and to market spillovers. By dramatically simplifying access to accurate imagery for any time and place, this technology will provide companies, researchers, educators, students, and regular citizens with a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring our changing planet and will contribute to increasing public engagement with science and technology. Further, the analytical capabilities offered by the imagery have great potential in scientific applications thus contributing to partnerships between academia and industry and improving datasets for research and education. Finally, this technology will be valuable in operational settings at the large providers of commercial satellite imagery, to individual users, and enable a wide variety of new visualization, analysis, and data mining applications. The examples of commercial applications for the technology are virtual earth, insurance and reinsurance, agriculture, emergency, change detection.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will operationally synthesize accurate regional-to-global, high spatial / high temporal satellite imagery of the Earth. The technology will utilize advanced data fusion algorithms to combine various sources of imagery while preserving the best spatial and temporal attributes of the data sources. The complexity of accessing, processing, and analyzing various sources of satellite imagery creates a significant barrier to its use. Synthesis of regionally and globally continuous high spatial / high temporal resolution imagery is a challenge as in addition to inherent differences in spatial and temporal resolutions of the source data, the new models need to account for enormous data volumes and sparse coverage of high spatial resolution imagery. Existing techniques to handle these challenges have severe limitations which curtail their use outside of the research arena. The technology will overcome these limitations by implementing algorithms that are robust, automated, scalable, deliver accurate data, and are usable in operational settings. They will provide spatially consistent and temporally relevant imagery which will empower businesses with regional and global outreach to make better decisions with better data.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to develop a new technology that combines advanced bioengineering with traditional chemical manufacturing. This hybrid approach will allow production of high value chemicals for the polymer industry using biomass at a lower price than current petrochemical based processes. This unique approach allows for the retrofit of existing ethanol fermentation facilities in rural areas with a bolt-on chemical upgrading unit to produce chemicals with far higher value than ethanol, improving the economics of operating these facilities and creating new jobs. The initial chemical product targeted by this project has an estimated $100M annual market and is used in manufacturing a variety of consumer products including specialty polyurethanes, inks, and UV degradable plastics which can be dramatically expanded to $1B by 2020 through cost reductions enabled by this new technology. Eventually, this approach combining existing fermentation facilities with a bolt-on chemical processing unit can be used to produce carbon-neutral fuels that are fully compatible with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel at price comparable to current petrochemical fuels. This project, while here focused on the higher value polymer market, will enable later development of cost competitive fuel production technology.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate at pilot scale a complete downstream process capable of manufacturing the target chemical from the intermediate platform molecule produced with fermentation. In upstream Visolis work, the key intermediate has been produced using fermentation facilities hosted at the Advanced Biofuels Process Demonstration Unit at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories and the National Renewable Research Laboratories (NREL) at pilot scale, and based on current performance metrics the intermediate can be manufactured at prices comparable to ethanol at commercial scale. The goals of this downstream project are to utilize the intermediate generated using a 9000L scale fermentation facility at NREL to demonstrate cost-effective production of the target product from this intermediate. The work includes construction of a pilot scale high pressure chemical reactor, production and testing of several catalysts for performance in producing the target molecule at different process conditions, optimization of the chemical production process, evaluation of the process and catalyst for long-term stability, purification of the products to the levels required by customers, and technoeconomic modeling to inform the design of a commercial facility.

- abstractText: "The broader impact / commercial potential of this Small Business
    Innovation Research Phase II project is to offer a low-cost novel filter to purify
    water with higher effectiveness and superior performance than currently available
    technologies such as carbon filters. The global water scarcity, including some
    parts of the US such as the southwest, has led to a strong need for efficient
    technologies to purify wastewater for direct or indirect potable reuse. Recently,
    there has been growing concerns over emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated
    compounds (PFCs e.g. PFOA and PFOS) in surface and groundwater. These PFCs are
    being found at many groundwater sites and in drinking water wells affected by
    PFCs. Current technologies are not efficient for the removal of PFCs from water,
    and there is an immediate need for new cost-effective treatment technologies.
    To address this unfulfilled need, this project seeks to develop a low cost, reusable
    filter unit for water purification to remove emerging contaminants such as PFCs.
    The technology is expected to be used by entities conducting industrial wastewater
    and groundwater treatment, and wastewater utilities that have a focus on water
    reuse. \n\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to develop a prototype
    water filter,  test and optimize it for the removal of emerging contaminants with
    a focus on PFCs. Specifically, the project will focus on: (1) optimization of
    the adsorbent performance and synthesis method; and scale-up of the synthesis
    method for bulk production of filter media; (2) optimization of the filter regeneration
    process; and (3) design, construct, and test a prototype unit of the technology;
    and determine the process cost. The work will confirm the effectiveness of the
    filter in removing the target contaminants as well as the effectiveness of the
    regeneration process to reuse the filter. The PFC contaminants will be first removed
    from the water and then destroyed. The overall performance of the technology will
    also be evaluated and compared with other available technologies to determine
    its cost-effectiveness."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to significantly improve outcomes for cardiothoracic surgical patients while reducing healthcare costs by ensuring proper post-surgical drainage. In the United States, approximately 750,000 major cardiothoracic surgeries are performed each year. Each of these patients receives an average of two chest tubes to drain fluid and facilitate proper recovery, but approximately 36% of chest tubes become clogged. Patients with clogged chest tubes are more likely to experience post-surgical complications, which can result in life-threatening conditions and significantly increase the cost of care. To mitigate the risk of clogging, surgeons typically use large-bore chest tubes, which are more likely to be misplaced and to cause injury to surrounding organs. The novel device under development addresses these issues by preventing clog formation in small-bore chest tubes, thus maintaining proper fluid drainage. Anticipated impacts of the device include reduced time to ambulation and discharge, hospital readmissions, and nursing time. Commercially, the device addresses a $300 million initial market opportunity and has the potential to save the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion per year from costs associated with preventable chest tube complications.

    The proposed project aims to develop a novel chest tube device to address the clinical need of maintaining proper fluid drainage after cardiothoracic surgery while enabling the use of small-bore chest tubes. Existing systems are prone to clogging, which can lead to life-threatening conditions, longer hospital stays, and increased costs. Building on the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I, the objective of this research is to continue development of the device and prepare for market entry; the research will be performed in three Aims. In the first Aim, critical aspects of usability and manufacturability will be addressed and incorporated into the final device design. In the second Aim, verification and validation activities will be performed to ensure the device meets all safety and functional requirements before clinical use. In the third Aim, the device?s supplemental ability to monitor lung healing status in patients undergoing thoracic surgery will be refined and tested on the benchtop and in an in vivo animal study.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling more efficient Annual Wind Energy Production (AEP) while reducing the cost of energy (COE). This will make wind energy more attractive economically, improve the energy security of the U.S, create jobs, and indirectly help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 2% AEP increase is generally considered attractive. Two turbines (5kW and 50kW) tested during Phase I have shown an increase in AEP between 2% to 8% while reducing the COE by 1% to 6%. About 150,000 turbines worldwide can be potentially be retrofitted with this technology.

    This project will address challenges related to aerodynamic efficiency of wind turbines and the cost of wind energy. It is based on a deeper understanding of wind turbine aerodynamics from a more 3-dimensional point of view; most wind turbine designs are based on 2- dimensional theories. The key technical challenge in bringing this technology to market is to demonstrate the increase in AEP of utility scale turbines retrofitted with our deflector technology in realistic field conditions while reducing the COE. This will be addressed by performing testing at a few customer wind farms and NREL testing centers. The R&D plan consists of designing, manufacturing, and installing deflectors on a few utility size turbines (30-100 meters diameter rotors). The tests will include power performance comparison between baseline and retrofitted turbines according to international standards.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of an informatics-based software platform that will help pharmaceutical companies create more new, effective, and safe drugs earlier in the R&D pipeline. This software platform will address a need for data integration and analysis tools to aid pharmaceutical researchers in 1) phenotypic screening, 2) toxicology analysis, and 3) drug repurposing. It will help these researchers quickly gather and interpret complex molecular and phenotypic data, making the drug discovery process more efficient and creating value for pharmaceutical companies. The economic impact of reducing the preclinical drug discovery process by just two weeks is estimated to be a $252 million cost savings for the industry. By using data more effectively earlier in the R&D process, this software platform also promises to enhance the quality of drugs that enter clinical trials. Thus, it provides an opportunity to reduce overall R&D spending and increase the number of drugs that enter the market - resulting in more economically priced medicines available to the population.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to build an informatics-based software platform that solves cross-domain data integration, analysis, and user application challenges in order to effectively use data to draw insights earlier in the R&D process and compress the development pipeline for new or repurposed drugs. Using highly scalable semantic graph technologies, a flexible three-layer architecture is being developed that includes the 1) Biomedical Data Layer, 2) Computational Layer, and 3) Application Layer. This architecture allows the system be fully scalable and extensible to other datasets and biomedical applications. The system will be beta-tested by pharmaceutical researchers and evaluated though the creation of scientifically relevant use-cases. This development will result in a commercial software system that makes important biomedical data and insights available to all researchers within a pharmaceutical organization by addressing high need data integration, analysis, and application challenges.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to fundamentally change what a storage device can do, and give storage a third capability that is not addressed by existing storage technology - the ability to actually process user data.  For the computation to take place, only the computational request and the resulting data need to transfer over the storage interface, reducing interface traffic and the required power. The advent of Big Data and the increasing use of Hyperscale Server technology have resulted in the creation of an additional storage tier that is different from traditional enterprise storage. This new tier requires significantly larger capacity yet lower cost, lower operating power, and yet must still exhibit enterprise level reliability. This combination of characteristics cannot be serviced by existing technologies, and execution with large data sets typical of Big Data results in inefficient solutions. The information being stored represents the large, unstructured data mined by today's companies for key information and trends that help dictate corporate direction, advertising, and monetization. Future applications include machine learning for video analytics, genome sequencing and enabling Fog Storage and Fog Computing, among others.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project explores the Big Data paradigm shift where processing capability is pushed as close to the data as possible. The In-Situ processing technology pushes this concept to the absolute limit, by putting the computational capability directly into the storage itself and eliminating the need to move data to main memory before processing. The technology innovation begins with a solid foundation of an enterprise SSD tailored for the needs of modern Data Centers. Key technology that will be added to support these capabilities include hardware-assisted quality of service control, low-cost 3D-TLC and QLC NAND Flash enablement through the use of advanced ECC, and a proprietary elastic Flash Translation Layer to support extremely large capacity drives. The final element added to this foundation will be the ability to perform computation directly on the data with the addition of specialized In-Situ processing aided by hardware accelerators.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that the proposed runtime verification technology will lead to a more robust definition of and architecture for ensuring safety in automobiles, medical devices, and aerospace and defense systems.  Through this, these forms of safety-critical infrastructure will be more resilient to attack and catastrophic failure resulting from both critical system failures and malicious attacks.  As a result, the technology will help to address a slew of recent problems with software failures, security compromises, and other unintentional software behaviors that inevitably occur as systems become more complex, potentially saving lives and making millions of safety-critical embedded systems safer, easier to upgrade, and better tested.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will commercialize a first-of-its-kind complete solution for runtime verification and software analysis specifically tailored for embedded systems.  From automobiles that connect to each other and drive autonomously, to control systems that run ever increasing networks that power our utilities, cities, and many other aspects of our daily lives, it is clear that embedded systems are here to stay in the most safety critical domains.  A growing problem in embedded systems is how to ensure they behave correctly; a good case study for this is automobiles, in which several high profile hacks and recalls have called into question the security and integrity of vehicles.  The proposed solution will fill this market niche with a suite of related analysis tools/modules, built on a common novel and formally rigorous runtime verification technology infrastructure, each module implementing unique instrumentation and analysis functionality.  These tools/modules together provide what is needed to develop safe embedded systems.

    track and trace capabilities of intravenous medication compounds.   Key objectives
    include both patient specific and anticipatory workflows with labels, a Passive
    Auditing management system for compounding quality control, and an innovation
    to improve operating room environment medication barcode scanning compliance.
    \ Today, healthcare providers utilize multiple barcoded label technologies with
    minimal embedded medication data across disparate systems.  Medication labels
    could be the link across these systems for ingredient traceability.  However,
    existing solutions are inadequate to meet 2013 legislative traceability mandates.
    \ The project invention will encrypt serialization fields within the barcoded
    label connecting a specific medication to its production data, and eventually
    to the patient.  Compounding process data, such as ingredients, environmental
    conditions, and production instructions, will be connected to individual medication
    labels and stored in the patient?s electronic record.  When an ingredient is recalled
    or questionable process identified, an extraction algorithm will pull the encrypted
    data from the EHR and will be connected to production data. Success of this project
    will be label readability by existing hospital scanners and retrieval of the serialized
    data from the EHR"

    proposed system will enhance the ability of the 1.3 million people currently living
    in the United States with a lower limb amputation to walk in unconstrained environments.
    \ The proposed Quasi-Active Prosthetic Ankle System (QPAS) addresses the RH6:
    Human Assistive Technologies area.  QPAS will be lightweight, have a long battery
    life, and optimize the passive dynamics of amputee gait in unconstrained environments
    by using battery energy to tune its physical system properties, ankle equilibrium
    angle and torsional stiffness.  The device provides a unique set of features that
    do not currently exist in the market, strengthening its value proposition.  The
    amputee population is growing; 2,000 new lower limb amputation are performed each
    week.  Therefore, QPAS will have strong market potential and the significant societal
    impact of improving health by supporting a more active lifestyle for lower limb
    amputees.  This will also lead to more community and family involvement.  Additionally,
    because of the many possibilities to control QPAS, gait researchers will be able
    to study amputee compensation preferences.  A better understanding of the kinematic
    and kinetic preferences could lead to improvements in the design of purely passive
    ankle prostheses.  \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2
    project addresses the needs of lower limb amputees. Lower limb amputees suffer
    from reduced self-selected walking speed, increased metabolic cost, increased
    reaction loads on the sound limb, poor gait symmetry, and reduced stability with
    increased risk of falling.  Passive prosthetic feet are only tuned for level ground
    walking at one speed.  QPAS will utilize a patented compliant actuator to achieve
    a unique set of features: passive energy storage with an articulating ankle joint,
    adaptable ankle angle for slope gait, low electrical energy usage, a large range
    of ankle motion, adaptable stiffness to optimize variable cadence level ground
    and slope gait, and controlled energy delivery to ensure energy builds naturally
    and smoothly.  In this phase 2 SBIR, an intuitive and autonomous controller will
    be built for the QPAS and human subject evaluations will assist in refining the
    device towards commercialization. QPAS will become a successful product by focusing
    on improved amputee gait performance in unconstrained environments, and being
    simple to fit and adjust, reliable and affordable."

    pipelines have low failure rate per mile of assets, pipeline operators are asked
    to proactively enhance pipeline integrity where they do not have all the necessary

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop an easy to use real-time formative assessment tool for educators that will be uniquely aligned to each student and deployed via a virtual reality learning game that uses venomous marine snails as a conduit for exploring scientific issues in nature. The USA is currently ranked 52nd in the world in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is detrimental intellectually and economically to the future of American society. Recent studies indicate it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that enhances student-learning abilities, particularly as it pertains to STEM. As a result, this project is driven by the research objectives to understand how children learn specific science content and why certain game elements are better suited to convey scientific material. The outcome of this project is a proprietary multi-tiered formative assessment tool that can measure real time student learning of novel STEM content obtained through a virtual reality learning game experience. This project will enable teachers to nimbly tailor future instruction with individualized student learning goals.  Commercialization of the products created in this project will transform scientific learning and measurable engagement in educational games for social and economic benefit to meet the NSF?s mission of supporting education initiatives that improve the lives of U.S. Citizens, and generate income for tax revenue and jobs via the employment of software designers, educators and scientists.

    The proprietary technology developed in this SBIR Phase II will be a first-of-its-kind assessment dashboard that will link virtual reality and web-based learning environments with formative assessment to fuel instruction and deepen learning. This project will build proprietary assessment tools into online and virtual reality games which continuously engage users in the process of scientific inquiry and discovery using novel formative assessments customized to each player. The proprietary assessment dashboard allows teachers and players to measure their progress in real-time and identify opportunities to enhance their STEM learning. Using Unity as the platform, player actions and decisions will be met with tailored formative assessments and ongoing feedback throughout game play. This feedback helps teachers delineate where their students are along their learning progressions and fuels further instruction. The novel approach of this assessment dashboard transforms qualitative and quantitative learning and has the potential to significantly enhance student engagement and commitment to scientific inquiry to support emerging science changemakers. The research objective of the player/teacher dashboard is to align feedback on student learning during game play with dynamic quantitative and qualitative formative assessment that create a seamless demonstration of knowledge acquisition while providing teachers with multiple opportunities to engage learners in deeper and more meaningful levels of inquiry before, during, and after gameplay. The products generated from this project are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) program to ensure the content is of the highest caliber and distribution is to a large global customer base. The anticipated results from exposing teachers and students to this project will be increased competencies in STEM, which will transform players into lifelong learners and enhance engagement in STEM fields and careers.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new alloys whose thermal expansion properties can be tailored for laser applications. The tailored thermal expansion alloys will prevent shifts in laser output frequencies, i.e. laser color, by preventing the natural temperature-induced thermal expansion and contraction that occurs in laser housings. This temperature stability is extremely important for fiber-optic systems that are the backbone of the telecommunications industry. According to Strategies Unlimited, the telecommunications laser market was $3.515 billion in 2014, and it is expected to increase with the increasing number of mobile devices and growing demand for high-speed internet. While oil and gas telecommunications systems were identified as the beachhead market, the alloys developed through this project will also have potential to add value to the wider telecommunications market and a number of other industrial and electronics applications.

    The intellectual merit of this project lies in a new method to exhibit unprecedented control over thermal expansion properties in metal alloys. The discovery that mechanical deformation tailors or "programs" the thermal expansion of a bulk metal to match that of other common materials (metals, polymers, and ceramics) will change the way scientists and engineers design for thermal compensation. These alloys can also be tailored not to expand or contract with temperature changes and even be made to shrink when heated. This wide range of tailored alloy responses is achieved without chemical changes or composite fabrication methods upon which competing technologies rely. This Phase II project will reduce the risks associated with implementing the tailored thermal expansion alloy technology in laser applications by developing high thermal conductivity alloys and testing prototypes. Alloys will be purchased, engineered to have a desired coefficient of thermal expansion, and tested for laser performance. The expected outcome of this work is the realization of tailored thermal expansion alloys in laser prototypes.

    Research Phase II project provides a technology platform to convert non-food biomass,
    such as wood and corn stalks, into biofuels, chemicals, and bioproducts. Biomass
    utilization is a solution to increase global sustainability and decrease petroleum-based
    greenhouse gas emissions. This project will use wood biomass to simultaneously
    co-produce three high-end products, dissolving pulp, furfural, and technical lignin,
    of which the dissolving pulp and furfural are the focus of this project. Current
    methods of producing these products only use one of the three primary biomass
    components. By co-producing two products, revenues increase and unit production
    costs decrease as production costs are spread over a larger product volume. The
    use of this solvent obtained from the biomass is a unique approach in the biomass
    conversion industry and offers an alternative to conventional enzyme or microbial
    processing. Benefits include restoring furfural production in the United States,
    decreasing dissolving pulp production costs, and increasing the commercial value
    of renewable biomass that currently has low or no value. This sustainable and
    environmentally friendly technology will increase global sustainability and revitalize
    rural economies by stimulating investment and creating jobs. \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate and advance to pilot scale
    our technology to simultaneously co-produce dissolving pulp and furfural from
    biomass using gamma valerolactone (GVL) as solvent. While other technologies focus
    on the production of a single product from biomass, GVL?' ability to fractionate
    lignocellulosic biomass into its three main components (cellulose, hemicellulose,
    and lignin) at high concentration and purity, produce significant cost and technical
    advantages. GVL fractionation produces solid cellulose at high yield (>90%) and
    purity (>90%), without the need for pre-treatment or further chemical refining.
    This cellulose can be converted into dissolving pulp for high-end applications
    such as textiles (rayon), cellophane, or microcrystalline cellulose. The hemicellulose
    fraction does not need to be separated from the GVL and is readily converted into
    furfural within GVL at high yields (>75%) and high concentrations, minimizing
    separation costs. Preliminary mass and energy balances and techno-economic modeling
    based on lab data predict attractive financial returns. Tasks will focus on biomass
    fractionation to produce dissolving pulp, furfural purification, and GVL recovery
    at bench-scale. This experimental work will inform the engineering development
    for an integrated, continuous process, pilot demonstration unit."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.

    The objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to promote and improve the use of high quality video in products that the general public works with every day.  From high resolution auto dashboard cameras, to low latency video streams from flying drones, to wireless laptop docking stations, to higher quality coverage of news and sporting events, to better and faster delivery of video over the Internet, every application requires the high quality, low latency, flexible, power efficient video encoders that will be developed in this project.  The uses of video are increasing every day.  Video instruction manuals are replacing printed instruction manuals.  Video is replacing still images in on-line advertising, social media and billboards.  It is predicted that over 90% of all Internet traffic will be video data in the next few years.  Enabling all these applications requires the latest technology in video compression such as the techniques developed in this project.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project tackles the problem of creating a real time video encoder, using the latest H.265 compression technology, running in hardware on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).  An FPGA is a type of chip on which the logic is configurable - it can be programmed to implement any function.  It represents a mid-point between a dedicated integrated circuit, which is very expensive to develop, and can never be changed or enhanced once it is fabricated, and a pure software solution which is very flexible but requires bulky and power hungry equipment (i.e. computers) as an underlying platform.  The research conducted under this grant will devise, test, and implement algorithms that are amenable to realization on an FPGA, that operate in real time, and that yield a high quality result in terms of the visual quality of the compressed video with respect to the number of bits used.  The goal, at the conclusion of this research, is the demonstration of a functional HEVC/H.265 encoder running on an FPGA which has cost, flexibility, power and performance advantages over other encoders.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to transform commercial construction through the democratization of scanning and automation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Constant design and change management is a unique challenge that is costing the US construction industry billions of dollars annually. In order to prevent such a huge economic loss, this industry is in the path for a digital revolution. BIM is known as the first truly global digital technology that could revolutionize the construction industry. However, BIM usage is currently limited because it is only viable for large-scale projects. The primary reason is that the process is too laborious and expensive. The proposed technology will completely eliminate these barriers. Its ease-of-use, ubiquity of the capturing device, and automated object detection democratizes as-built BIM modeling. Enormous value could be generated due to streamlining and data management capabilities that are offered by the technology in the form of accelerated project schedules, reduced numbers of requests for information and change orders, and timely identified design clashes. This will pave the way to increase the competitiveness of the US construction industry, by enabling new products and services that support automatic BIM modeling.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigates the technical and commercial feasibility of an automatic and inexpensive solution for the Scan-to-BIM problem in the construction industry. Scan-to-BIM refers to 3D scanning of a physical structure and converting the captured raw spatial data into an object-oriented, semantically-rich model. Although there are a few technologies that aim to facilitate this process, the 3D modeling component remains primarily a manual and time-consuming task. When using the proposed technology, a non-technical worker videotapes the target structure. The video is automatically sent to a server for processing. A unique videogrammetric 3D reconstruction engine reconstructs the 3D geometry of the structure in the form of a 3D point cloud. It then extracts object hypotheses from key video frames and spatial data in the form of observations. Afterwards, it optimizes a novel coherent joint probability distribution function and infers a 3D layout. The outcome is an object-oriented 3D representation of the structure with embedded geometrical attributes and property sets. The main novelty of this technology lies in a hybrid approach that combines low-level segmentation with high-level space modeling. This advances the state-of-the-art in robust intelligence, particularly the interpretation of complex, unstructured data.

    vivo surgical development and ex vivo efficacy studies supported by our Phase
    I/IB awards.  First, a 40-animal rat study will be undertaken to further investigate
    the biocompatibility of the retinal implant.  Second, previously developed surgical
    procedures will be refined in pigs to ensure reproducible and safe subretinal
    implantation. Third, a high-throughput in vitro assay will be designed to investigate
    a number of implant parameters, as well as the integrity and biostability of the
    retinal implant using retinal pigment epithelial cells.   Additionally, medical
    device sealants will be investigated in this in vitro study, and the functional
    integrity of the implant will be measured using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy
    and an ion-sensitive detector, which is being developed specifically for this
    application.  Lastly, this ion-sensitive detector will provide an opportunity
    to further measure the spatial sensitivity of the retinal implant with high resolution.
    \ These in vivo and in vitro studies are vital for the continued evaluation of
    biocompatibility, surgical feasibility, and efficacy of the implant.  The results
    from these studies will further demonstrate the commercial viability of the technology
    under development."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to develop an online, fully automated platform for designing high-affinity antibodies for use as potential drug candidates. The success of antibody-based drugs has generated interest in faster and more efficient methods to discover and optimize antibodies. The goal of this project will be to develop and implement a computational method for producing protein sequences of humanized antibodies. This will be achieved by providing software that allows scientists to move some of their initial experiments into the cloud, and achieve results much more quickly by using computational methods saving time and cost for new drug development. In addition, it is anticipated that this will improve the features of antibody-based drug candidates, enhance the success rate of clinical studies, and accelerate the commercialization of new drugs.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and implement computational tools for designing antibodies that are more effective, have fewer side effects, and have fewer problems in manufacturing. Current computational design methods rely almost entirely on the expertise of scientists iterating between experimental and bioinformatics approaches. An automated, systematic approach will help researchers design better antibodies with desired features in a shorter amount of time. The final platform will allow researchers to incorporate experimental and structural information to develop better drugs by determining which experiments will be necessary, assessing the viability of a potential candidate, and identifying structural features responsible for the molecule?s stability, immune response, and binding properties. The typical antibody design process takes many months and tens of thousands of dollars. With the aid of a computational process, this time can be cut back to the click of a button.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be the development of genetically engineered tobacco plants that produce antibodies for the treatment of individuals infected with the Ebola virus. In the recent Ebola outbreak, a new antibody-based drug was shown to be effective in treating infected patients that was based on a transient tobacco-produced Ebola antibody cocktail called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc, San Diego, CA). Unfortunately, Mapp Biopharmaceutical's supply of antibody was quickly depleted, as the manufacturing method was not able to keep up with demand. The technological innovation in this proposal is the targeted production of antibodies within the gland cells of the tobacco leaf surface structures called glandular secreting trichomes. The research objectives will be to demonstrate the secretion of antibodies to the Ebola virus from tobacco trichome glands. The goal is to generate a line of N. tabacum plants that is optimized for antibody production in plant trichomes to provide a biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale production of antibodies that may be used in the treatment of Ebola infection, and in the future, other diseases.

    This SBIR Phase II project proposes to use a recently developed plant-based biomanufacturing system to scale-up the production of antibodies to the Ebola virus for use as a therapeutic treatment. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has produced a drug based on antibodies to the Ebola virus produced in a tobacco plant transient gene expression system.  Using this system, they have identified a glycosylated antibody variant (glycoform) with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Using glycosyl-transferase knockout lines of N. benthiamiana and transient expression strategies, the company utilizes plants to produce glycosylated antibodies that produce optimal recruitment of natural immune effector cells (Olinger et al., 2012). Other expression hosts (Chinese hamster ovary cells, yeast) yield product with reduced potency, and are not suitable alternatives. To recover active antibody with their current plant expression technology, Mapp Biopharmaceutical must destructively harvest plants, and isolate antibody from plant tissue homogenates. Unfortunately, this method has not been able to produce enough antibodies to satisfy the demand.  The proposed method will allow for the production of antibodies in tobacco plants in large scale.  In addition, the proposed system will use antibody harvesting strategies that do not require destructive homogenization as the antibodies will be secreted onto the surface of the leaf, and recovered by washing. The goals of this project are to increase the functionality of plant-produced antibodies, scale-up production, and reduce the costs of production further through system optimization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to address one of the primary barriers to the emergence of flexible electronics -the inability to assembly and interconnect thinned integrated circuits (ICs) onto flexible substrates in a reliable, cost-effective, high volume manner. Flexible electronics has been the subject of many industry journals, trade shows, technical conferences and market research reports. All describe a new age of ubiquitous electronics with devices embedded in the structures and items around us.  Flexible electronic devices, unlike today's devices that are rigid and boxy, can conform to natural, curved shapes that exist in the real world. However, flexible electronics have yet to have their predicted economic and social impact. A major reason is because the electronics industry has not yet found a reliable, low-cost method for assembling thin, flexible ICs onto flexible circuit boards. Today's 'pick-and-place' assembly technology cannot handle ICs thin enough to be flexible. Until a new method is developed and adopted, the potential of flexible electronics will likely not be realized.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the integrated circuit (IC) aspects of a flexible hybrid electronics technology to a level at which these devices can be produced reliably and in volumes in a production-relevant environment. While most of the components of flexible hybrid electronics technology relating to printed electronics methods have been adequately researched and developed, little has been done on the integration of solid-state semiconductor devices onto highly flexible, organic substrates. Partial results have been reported in the literature, however, no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive, wafer-to-end product approach suitable for commercial applications. This project will address this gap by focusing on all the steps for IC integration, including the preparation for assembly of ultra-thin, flexible semiconductor dies, their attachment onto a flexible circuit board using laser-enabled assembly technology, and their reliable electrical interconnection. The anticipated end results will be a complete flexible hybrid electronics integration technology developed to a level of pilot production readiness.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that it will enable a group of customers we call Risk Pricers (specifically, property and casualty insurance underwriters and mortgage bankers in financial firms) to profit from tailoring pricing on their products. They can do this by rapidly predicting financial losses for buildings having specific configurations, using the software developed in this proposal. These customers can then tailor pricing of earthquake insurance and mortgage terms based on refined analyses that we facilitate. Besides offering a clear financial benefit to Risk Pricers, this new analysis approach will also fundamentally change market forces and incentives around building safety. If a building's owner is incentivized to improve its earthquake performance (via lower insurance and mortgage costs), then high-performance buildings become more appealing and this will encourage design of better buildings. As the company's software makes more explicit the links between building properties and financial costs, society will benefit from more efficient resource allocation, ultimately leading to increased societal resilience.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop algorithms and software tools that provide financial guidance to customers interested in repair costs and closures of buildings due to earthquakes.  To complete the development of its tool, the company will focus on calibrating statistical models to predict displacements and accelerations in a wide range of building types, when they are subjected to earthquake shaking. The company's method for rapid estimation of structural responses utilizes principles of engineering mechanics, but applied in a domain where academic research does not focus (i.e., estimating response of a structure whose properties are not fully known to the analyst). The key identified need is to calibrate a statistical predictive model for the response of a structure that is effective over all popular construction types of interest to customers in the insurance and mortgage banking markets (i.e., light frame wood, steel, concrete, concrete tilt-up). The company will also develop loss metric and calculation outputs that incorporate insurance contract conditions such as deductibles and limits, in order to link the calculations to customers' workflows.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be high performance error correction for flash memory. Error correction plays a critical row in making digital devices reliable. Shrinking semiconductor geometries results in more errors. This has created a special problem for flash memory where the need for more rigorous error correction is approaching a practical limit with the widely used Bose Chaudhuri Hocquengham error correction. Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) is a recognized solution that  can approach the theoretical limits of what is possible. This LDPC based technology can improve lifetime of flash by without the added cost of the existing BCH solution. This technology helps Flash Memory enterprises to use higher density flash to improve storage capacity and cut the storage product costs. Without the superior performance, small size and low power consumption of the LDPC technology, the migration to low cost high capacity flash memories will be seriously slowed. In the absence of a comparable alternative approach, there will be serious limitations on the performance of a vast array of products that depend on highly reliable and economical flash storage.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a variety of  techniques to minimize the area and power requirements and enhance the performance of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error correction codes for flash memory. Many of these techniques are applicable to a wide range of error correction applications in digital communication and storage from WiFi to hard disk drives. The need for better error correction is crucial for flash memory but there is a widening demand for improved error correction. For example larger memories require better error correction to insure the system failure rate is low. In the next two years the company expects to develop a Verilog version of the LDPC decoder that is easily integrated with a flash controller. The project will work with potential customers/partners to ensure the code works with controllers. In the long run these techniques can be adapted to a wide range of applications as the need for more reliable data continues to rapidly expand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can be found across the semiconductor industry with its initial market in wireless communications.  Due to the extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), applications include low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, and RF power amplifiers (PAs). Looking forward, carbon nanotube transistors (CFETs) can reshape analog radio frequency electronics, enabling the higher data rates and improved capacity demanded by next generation wireless systems due to their intrinsic linearity and associated low out of band interference . CFETs are highly efficient, dissipating less unwanted power than current state of the art technologies while handling high power levels. This translates into more battery life for mobile devices with lower cooling costs. With more linear RF transistors, many billions of dollars of spending on additional base stations, larger batteries, and radio spectrum can be avoided, at great savings to consumers and industry. More speculatively, the creation of reliable grwoth techniques for CFETs and associated manufacturing processes may offer an excellent sensor platform or better ways to form on chip interconnects. The key problems being investigating of in situ growth of high performance nanotubes are applicable to the fabrication of CNT based devices for many electronic applications.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop electronic devices for radio frequency applications using carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  CNTs are a one dimensional material with diameters in the nanometer range. CNTs have unique and highly desirable properties ranging from superior mobility to current carrying capability to thermal stability.  Calculations show CNT amplifiers will be inherently linear with noise suppressed to the lowest possible quantum limit. These properties allow for electronic devices that will perform better than existing technologies, such as silicon and gallium arsenide.  Just as importantly, the cost for making these devices will be dramatically lower due to the relatively simple method for material synthesis and device fabrication. This work will enable wafer scale arrays of high density in-situ tubes to be grown on silicon enabling the development of carbon electronic components a manner comparable to silicon devices. This work will enable cost effective wafer scale growth of devices which exploit the groundbreaking linearity that CNTs can deliver.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project in the long term has two main components.  First, the development has potential to reduce the country's overall energy consumption by funding the development of low cost air quality sensors for energy efficient buildings.  And second, the project will enhance the safety of our natural gas infrastructure with a low cost, low power methane (natural gas) sensor technology.    This work will develop a methane (natural gas) sensor prototype with 10x lower cost, size and power consumption than current solutions.  The proposed methane sensor will meet several currently unmet needs.  These include enhanced public safety by enabling methane leak detection for natural gas distribution systems, and protecting first responders by enabling more and better methane detection in hazardous environments.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop the world's most porous materials, Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sensing material.  MOFs have been an active topic in material science research for over a decade, but they have yet to find a commercial application.  This project promises to be the first commercialization of this exciting new class of materials.  Nearly 40,000 different MOF structures have been identified to date.  The crux of this work is to use a combination of computer models and laboratory experimentation to optimize a MOF structure that selectively and rapidly absorbs methane gas.  The end goal of this project is to develop a commercial prototype methane sensor 'on a chip' that consists of a solid state mass transducer with the MOF coating that has been tuned for sensing methane.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer electronics market
    (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance, low power, small footprint
    multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices, are all directly microfabricated on a common
    ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented user experiences by using data collected from all sensors and
    processed using machine learning algorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to
    exceed $6 billion dollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to
    reach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion market. This can have
    a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with mobile platforms, can be used to
    monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these solutions affordable will make it amenable to low
    income households not only in the US but also around the world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of
    knowledge such as in digital sensory systems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.

    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale microfabrication of
    Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
    substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a structural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and
    accelerometers, are pervasively used in consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however,
    requiring higher device performance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on
    the same package, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by monolithically
    fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon as a structural material. Using e-
    Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the structural material, can enable easier routing to
    implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller dimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as
    no wafer bonding is required, smaller form factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing
    low noise and higher performance. Phase II tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate an inertial measurement unit that is
    monolithically integrated with its ASIC with optimal performance parameters.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless
    communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.
    Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,
    WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive
    antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi
    and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more
    effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity
    in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities
    that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with
    more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.
    These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project
    builds upon.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and
    commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input
    multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset
    manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their
    complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector
    grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near
    optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This
    limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger
    array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near
    optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.
    It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the ability of the haloacetic acids (HAAs) analyzer proposed here to change how superintendents of drinking water utilities go about understanding their drinking water treatment plants. The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.



    This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to continue the development of a family of new nanostructured conductive additives for use in high-performance coatings and composite resins. Static charge buildup from the environment is a critical problem in a number of vehicular applications, which increasingly utilize lightweight components constructed from non-conductive plastic or composite materials.  Static charge buildup interferes with electronic components, such as distributed sensors, so that mitigation of this effect is essential for safe vehicle operation. The design of lightweight vehicles using composite materials, which requires high-performing antistatic coatings, will lead to large reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation.  In 2011, emissions from transportation accounted for 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Modern aircraft designs, utilizing composite materials, show more than 20% reduction in fuel consumption compared to traditional vehicles.  Imminent increases in fuel efficiency standards in automobiles will also drive manufacturers to adopt the use of composite materials. The development of the proposed antistatic coatings is essential to enabling these new lightweight material technologies.

    The new additives are based on the synthesis of self-assembling nanostructures from conductive polymers and structure-directing agents. When successfully incorporated in commercial paints and primers, the conductive properties of the coating are enhanced without compromising adhesion and durability. In this Phase II effort, we will further optimize these additives, based on key customer requirements, and develop a plan to scale up their production tenfold with reduced waste and production time.  Corrosion properties for marine applications will also be evaluated, and the product portfolio will be expanded to address follow-on applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is significant; transitions of care impact millions of Americans every year. The healthcare system bears substantial cost and inefficiency&#8232;on account of suboptimal care transitions and overspending. This Phase II project will support progress towards a "learning healthcare system" and will extend the capabilities of data mining and machine learning in healthcare

    The proposed project seeks to improve data mining technologies for healthcare decision support. This project will focus on the analysis of a broad variety&#8232;of data types that are common in healthcare settings. The anticipated improvements would allow frontline care staff, operational managers, and healthcare executives to assess and make stronger evidence-driven decisions regarding quality, cost, and access as patients move through the healthcare system. The enhanced data mining system would utilize state-of-the-art pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to dynamically process and interpret clinical, claims, and other types of healthcare data. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics.

    Research Phase II project is that the palladium on hierarchically porous monolithic
    carbon catalyst being developed promises longer lifetimes and higher performance
    to industrial chemical companies. This more active, more selective catalyst can
    lower the operating temperature in chemical reactions thereby decreasing energy
    usage and giving products with fewer impurities, requiring a smaller number of
    purification steps and producing less waste. Success will therefore impact both
    ecological and commercial sustainability in the chemical industry.  \n\nThe objectives
    of this Phase II research project are 1) demonstrate that the carbon support is
    scalable while maintaining the mechanical properties needed for industrial use,
    2) scale loading the palladium catalyst onto the support, 3) exhibit the same
    high catalytic performance as the laboratory prepared catalyst, and 4) enter full
    scale production while setting up a quality system. The catalyst to be produced
    at large quantities represents the first of a new class of hierarchically porous
    catalyst supports and so further validation of this new product will provide the

    explore the applicability of a Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GD-OCM)
    instrument to image and evaluate optical materials as part of the manufacturing
    process.  The immediate broader impact of this project is to effectively provide
    both qualitative and quantitative information about product quality in manufacturing,
    with an initial focus on contact lens manufacturing. Providing high-speed, industrial,
    micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions, GD-OCM enables contact lens
    manufacturers to replace multiple inspection steps with a single measurement done
    automatically, reducing the opportunity for damaging the samples and human error,
    and ultimately leading to increased productivity and yield.  The resulting improvements
    in contact lens performance and extended wear effects are poised to have a positive
    impact on a significant percentage of the population.  Recent evaluations of GD-OCM
    have indicated its ability to provide a new wealth of characterization methods
    for quality control of various materials that are otherwise impossible to characterize
    nondestructively, including gradient refractive index polymers, glass and layered
    structures.  Additionally, GD-OCM will enable new advances in a wide variety of
    scientific fields via its capability to non-invasively optically section samples
    of a variety of material types. \n\nThe objective of this Phase II project is
    to establish the effectiveness of the emerging GD-OCM technology for nondestructive
    on-line metrology of contact lenses in manufacturing. Quality control and detection
    of product-significant defects, and a corresponding increase in production yield,
    represent the value proposition for the introduction of GD-OCM instrumentation
    into the contact lens production environment. The project will result in two major
    outcomes: 1) implementation of a robust production-environment instrument to effectively
    provide micrometer-level resolution in all three dimensions and quantification
    of yield-relevant contact lens quality metrics not previously available in a single
    instrument; and 2) demonstration of the technology for inspection in a production
    environment to rapidly and accurately monitor defects and quantify contact lens
    quality using product relevant metrics. This nondestructive, on-line optical inspection
    system can have significant impact not only on the process control and thereby
    yield of contact lenses, but also in manufacturing of layered materials in general,
    including polymers, plastics, and glass. Longer-term, the technology offers new
    paths for tissue imaging, guided surgery, and monitoring of eye disease."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to allow a greater number of organizations,

    Modern SWIR technology has existed for more than 40 years, but its expense has
    limited its use to the military and large corporations; this project is grounded
    in the belief that when everyone has access to SWIR technology, the benefits to
    society are exponential.  SWIR image sensors have potential applications in food
    safety analysis (e.g., identifying harmful adulterated foods and revealing sub-surface
    flaws in produce), manufacturing (e.g., sorting), security (e.g., night vision),
    medical sensing (e.g., vein mapping and blood oxygenation monitoring), and the
    automotive field (e.g., night/inclement weather vision systems and for self-driving
    vehicles). A low-cost sensor will open the SWIR imaging market to players in these
    fields who have so far been shut out due to price. In addition, a low-cost, high-quality
    sensor will also make SWIR imaging directly available to the general public for
    the first time ever in the form of a SWIR camera smartphone add-on, establishing
    a new market for SWIR imaging. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

    will address these problems by utilizing a unique Ge-based SWIR sensor structure.
    In addition, a monolithic method of integrating the image sensor material onto
    the Si readout integrated circuit will be pursued. This will enable precise alignment
    of the readout integrated circuit  and the imaging device, which will lead to
    smaller pixel size and better resolution. Finally, issues of power use and sensitivity
    will be addressed through an innovative structure called Gate-controlled Charge

    processes necessary to reliably produce low-cost, high-quality Ge-based SWIR image

    New photonic bandgap structures, characterized by suppressed density fluctuations

    that light propagates the same way through the photonic solid independent of direction
    (which is impossible for a photonic crystal). While the layout of waveguides in

    tightly-constrained to follow characteristic crystal axes, the layout rules for
    hyper uniform disordered solid waveguides have no such fundamental constraints.
    The universal protocol and highly-efficient computational framework covering the
    full range of photonic crystal, quasi crystal , and hyper uniform disordered solid-based

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are both technical and economic. The developed error-correction solutions will enable flash-memory-based devices to have higher capacities, higher reliability, and faster speeds at lower power while driving down the cost. This will have a major impact on mobile computing capabilities and enterprise storage by improving the efficiency and reliability of data centers, servers, and mission-critical storage that incorporate flash memories. Improved enterprise storage boosts the efficiency and growth of IT businesses, e-commerce, and financial trade. The solutions will also enable reduced power consumption and heat dissipation leading to greener systems.  The benefits of the error-correction solutions are also applicable to the hard disk drive and communications industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate novel low-density parity-check (LDPC)-based error-correction for flash memory-based solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are rapidly being deployed for both enterprise and consumer storage due to their fast speeds, low power, and low heat dissipation. But they bring numerous technical challenges stemming from the fact that reducing flash memory cell sizes leads to an unavoidable degradation in the reliability. With a trend of increasing die density to enable higher storage capacities, the industry is swiftly moving towards adopting LDPC codes to provide more powerful error-correction. However existing LDPC solutions use complex post-processing and multiple reads to bring down the error rates to the desired levels which lowers the read speeds, making them unattractive for future SSDs.  Novel binary LDPC-based solutions will be developed for a range of parameters, and validated in hardware.  The design method will be extended to develop new non-binary LDPC solutions which provide even greater reliability enhancements, leading to greater endurance in SSDs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aligns with a major shift in healthcare to reduce hospital acquired infections. At a cost of over $1.5B and 600,000 extra hospital days in the US alone, surgical wound infection in high-risk abdominal surgery patients is a major healthcare burden. In addition, providers and hospitals face greater scrutiny of their wound infection rates today, and the sweeping changes of healthcare reform have incentivized these critical stakeholders to invest in preventative solutions. However, currently available solutions are insufficient, and existing surgical device companies have not developed a compelling pipeline of products to address this unmet need. The proposed technology enjoys a competitive advantage in that it operates in a relatively open competitive landscape, and its unique mechanism of action provides a comprehensive wound protection strategy. Thus, this technology has the potential to make a significant worldwide impact on wound infection, both from a healthcare quality and commercialization standpoint. The initial market for this technology is in colorectal surgery, with ample expansion opportunities into other abdominal surgical markets totaling over $1 billion.


    The proposed project seeks to develop and commercialize a novel technology designed to prevent one of the most frequent, morbid, and costly hospital-acquired infections: surgical wound infection. The technology is an innovative surgical tool that provides a comprehensive anti-contamination strategy for the wound that is also user-friendly for the surgeon. This device has the potential to be a transformative innovation in the quality of surgical care, particularly in the 3.5 million patients undergoing high-risk abdominal-gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in whom wound infections are the most common. The technology also allows surgeons to experiment with a variety of approaches to identify ?best practices? for intraoperative wound care. This Phase II project proposes three main objectives. First, the company will refine the scientific understanding of the local and systemic therapeutic of the anti-contamination therapy through numerical modeling and pre-clinical testing in a porcine model in order to provide clinical use recommendations. Second, the company will design and develop a product sized for laparoscopic surgeries in order to support a broad-based commercialization effort. Third, the company with develop scaled manufacturing capability to support commercial release of the CleanCision product platform.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project derives from an enhanced capability for automated processing of free text and other structured data.  Motivation for this approach comes from neural networks and, in turn, it has applications to neural modeling and our understanding of how the brain processes information.  In the software industry, commercial innovation continues to revolve around automated processing of web pages, which plays a key role in creating many new companies.  Therefore, the ability to automate decision-making from free text is increasing in importance. A better way to represent text for use with machine learning will open new capabilities wherever the structure of sentences must be taken into account.  This has the potential to lead to new startup ventures, thereby resulting in new products and services. A successful project will result in platform technology that can provide a substantial competitive edge to companies that take advantage of it, provide new and better capabilities for consumers, and help advance the nation's lead in technological innovation.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to further develop new ways to process textual material so that computers can better learn applications related to natural language.  Applications include sentiment analysis (assigning either positive or negative views to a body of text), summarization of documents, and classification of documents using multiple labels from a fixed set of many classes.  The project will further develop new techniques to improve performance, and prototype components for transforming text and applying computerized learning methods. The new techniques represent words simultaneously with document structure using a single high-dimensional vector (for example, a list of 1,000 numbers).  The project is aimed at improving computational capabilities involving documents, web pages, and other text as well as providing new techniques that can be applied to automated translation, better computer understanding of images, and genomic information.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project results from lowering the barrier to entry for, and simplifying the use of, cloud computing systems via a novel, open source, cloud platform.  The proposed advances have the potential to facilitate and expedite innovation and technological progress by a diverse software and global developer community, enabling more people to tackle the important yet increasingly challenging and data-intensive computing problems facing businesses today. The company's technologies address directly the key pain points of this explosively growing platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and cloud-based application development market - namely privacy, lock-in, and control.  Unique to the company's approach is compatibility with a leading, proprietary, public cloud PaaS standard (Google App Engine).  As such, the company's solutions have significant commercial potential because they are directly applicable to businesses that employ App Engine today (there are currently over 4.5 million active applications), and they lay the groundwork for addressing the larger PaaS market in the long term.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is based on a distributed system that executes and manages web-based and mobile cloud applications (apps) via automation, thereby relieving developers, operations staff, and Information Technology (IT) groups of the burden of doing so.  The proposed technology advances address the issue of vendor lock-in - i.e. the use of proprietary technologies, services, and systems that effectively prevent users from switching to alternative vendors.  In the cloud space, lock-in is proliferated through the use of (i) proprietary interfaces and tools, (ii) complex pricing models, and (iii) the lack of interoperability across vendors.  The proposed technology disrupts lock-in by public cloud vendors by automating software deployment and management across clouds, and by making it easy to move applications and data between vendor offerings and on-premise clusters. In particular, the company's technologies abstract away the complexities of cloud use, and provide monitoring, backup/restoration, and migration of applications and data across clouds at the push of a button.  By providing features that are currently unavailable today, the proposed technologies have significant potential for reducing the cost, risk, and learning curve associated with cloud-based development, deployment, disaster recovery, and migration for the next generation of cloud applications.

    The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at reducing the impact of knee arthritis and improving the quality of life for those suffering from this debilitating condition, while simultaneously strengthening the bond between academia and industry by providing students with unique research opportunities through the development of a novel Total Knee Replacement technology.  Over 600,000 total knee replacement procedures are performed annually, comprising 8% of all Medicare spending.  Total hospital charges for this procedure approached $40 billion for 2012.  The revision rates for this procedure are significant: 10% at 10 years and 20% at 20 years.  Considering the aging population of the United States, the number of total knee replacements and revisions are steadily increasing and the majority of these will be completed under Medicare coverage.  The primary cause for revision surgery is loosening of the implants.  This innovation aims to develop an anchoring method for implantable orthopedic devices that will reduce the total number of revision procedures performed by creating a more stable interface between the bone and the device, and therefore enhance the scientific and technological understanding of orthopedic implants in general.

    The proposed project is a device that utilizes structural engineering principles such as load transfer and truss design to improve osteo-incorporation of a total knee replacement implant; such a device is likely to be more efficacious than current designs.  Currently available systems suffer from significant revision rates after being implanted only a short while.  With younger patients receiving these implants, devices need to be developed that will give the mobility and quality of life required by these patients.  The novel web structure fixing the tibial tray of a total knee replacement into the bone should provide improved initial fixation, reduce micro-motion, and eliminate aseptic loosening, all of which contribute towards a reduced revision rate and improved patient comfort.  After using the information gained from the Phase I SBIR investigation to inform computational models, the design of this device will be finalized.  The device will then be subjected to rigorous mechanical testing to investigate its performance in vivo, while simultaneously serving to satisfy the testing requirements mandatory for FDA approval.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the ability to rapidly engineer yeast for
    production of fuels, chemicals, enzymes, and other valuable molecules. Yeast offers
    high value production capabilities; however, engineering new strains is very complex
    and expensive - costing approximately $75-100 million, and requiring 7-10 years
    for development with current engineering methods. This project will develop a
    genome engineering technology for yeast that can substantially reduce the cost
    and time for developing new strains for industrial biotechnology applications.
    This technology will increase the ability of companies to use yeast to efficiently
    produce high-quality products from renewable feedstocks, and help grow the overall
    industrial biotechnology market. \n \nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    the ability to perform rapid whole-genome engineering in industrial yeast strains.
    Current technologies to engineer cells for specific functions (e.g., chemical
    or fuel production) are inefficient, expensive and extremely time consuming. Multiplex
    Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) is a disruptive technology that provides a
    powerful platform to engineer microorganisms at tremendously reduced cost. Until
    recently, MAGE was limited to a laboratory strain of E. coli, possessing key genetic
    features that enable MAGE. Recent advances have allowed us to port MAGE to yeast,
    and the goal of this project is to increase efficiency of the system and endow
    existing industrial yeasts with the capacity to undergo MAGE. The goal is to improve
    MAGE efficiency in yeast by developing a high-throughput system to rapidly create
    and quantify strain variants for their capacity to undergo the MAGE process itself.
    This project will establish a system to identify and optimize the requisite genetic
    features for MAGE in yeast, in order to rapidly engineer industrial yeast strains
    for specific function."

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to significantly enhance reliability
    and security of critical network infrastructure, and ease network management tasks.
    Through multiple pilot deployments on live networks, a prototype version of the
    company's software tool has found a number of serious errors and vulnerabilities
    that were missed by existing state-of-the-art auditing techniques and monitoring
    tools, and was able to perform real-time network-wide verification within as little
    as one millisecond. When more fully developed under this project, the company's
    technology will help ensure highly available networking infrastructures. To this
    end the company will work with Urbana-Champaign Big Broadband (UC2B), a community
    network expected to provide gigabit fiber-to-the-premise to 2700 under-served
    residences and 350 community anchor institutions. The company will also work with
    the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI), which is building a collaborative
    network environment to catalyze groundbreaking discoveries and innovation in emerging
    global networks. \n\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
    will continue the development and commercialization of a new approach to analyzing
    and protecting computer networks. Every aspect of our society, from business,
    to government, to medicine and the sciences, is now tightly intertwined with the
    functioning of computer networks such as the Internet. However, modern networks
    are extremely complex, leading to a rich variety of failure modes and outages.
    These errors can result in very high costs for businesses, including lost revenue
    from SLAs, lost customers and contracts, fines for violating regulations such
    as HIPAA, leaks of sensitive information, and decline in corporate image. To address
    this challenge, the company is building a system that automatically verifies security
    and correctness of computer networks in real-time, discovers vulnerabilities,
    and assists network operators in determining their cause. The technology functions
    by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network's behavior,
    and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically determine whether the
    network contains faults. It can vet networks continuously as the network state
    evolves, detect transient errors and signal immediate alarms, and scale to large
    and highly dynamic environments. It is intended to provide immediate practical
    assistance to network operators."

    the precision of microtechnology with low-power microfluidics to realize a fully-implantable
    micropump specifically tailored for drug delivery applications in rodents. Currently,
    drug administration is predominantly conducted by manual handling and needle injection
    which is labor-intensive, induces stress and other ?white-coat? effects and is
    limited to simple drug release profiles. There is a need for advanced drug administration
    capability in animals that enables new complex dosing profiles, provides automation
    for chronic studies, and improves scientific validity. Technical challenges include
    the development of a low-power inductively-powered pump actuator, ten-fold pump
    miniaturization and wireless control of a large number of implanted pumps. The
    research objectives are (1) to optimize pump performance and usability (2) to
    extend cage size compatibility and connectivity (3) to optimize software usability
    (4) to optimize system design and establish quality assurance processes for scale-up
    and (5) to conduct an in-vivo validation study.  Successful demonstration of the
    remotely-controlled implantable infusion pump system will enable new dosing schemes,
    provide precise temporally controlled dosing for more reproducible results from
    acute and chronic studies, and enable new approaches to drug therapy that would
    not otherwise be possible. \n\n\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this
    project lies in uniquely improving scientific outcomes and facilitating the drug
    development/discovery process. Currently, only one in 10,000 drug candidates successfully
    attain FDA approval with a significant number of candidates failing or discarded
    due to inadequate drug administration.  Rapid and accurate evaluation of efficacy,
    safety and toxicity early in the drug development process is improved through
    the fully automated, wirelessly-controlled drug dosing technology supported by
    this Phase II project.  This project targets the international laboratory animal
    market estimated at $3.4B in 2012. Animal models are employed throughout the drug
    development pipeline and in particular, rodents are critical to drug candidate
    target validation, screening, and optimization. Included in this effort are several
    significant first-to-market capabilities such as chronic dosing capability in
    freely-moving, tether-free mice and high-throughput evaluation of multiple new
    drugs through automation. The controlled delivery of agents, including emerging
    biologics, siRNA, peptides, and small molecules, is an important capability in
    a multitude of clinical and preclinical research applications including neuroscience,
    pharmacology, toxicology, and physiology. More importantly, this project will

    positron emission tomography (PET) imaging products to manage neurodegenerative
    disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. PET is now a key diagnostic and
    management tool in oncology, and compounds labeled with [18F]-fluoride provide
    optimal signal to noise ratios and resolution in medical imaging applications.
    Ground Fluor Pharmaceuticals (GFP) developed proprietary single-step fluorination
    technology that allows [18F]-labeled medicines to be prepared efficiently from
    cyclotron-produced [18F]-fluoride. Under this Phase II research project GFP will
    apply its new technology to produce the imaging agent 6- [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA),
    a compound useful in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and in cancer imaging, that
    is not currently readily available because of the difficulty in its production.
    GFP will scale-up and manufacture pharmaceutical grade ALPDOPA (GFP's precursor
    to FDOPA) under pharmaceutical cGMP conditions, and offer this material for research
    studies and for clinical imaging. GFP will develop an FDA drug master file and
    will provide technical and regulatory assistance to cyclotron pharmacy customers
    adopting GFP's technology for commercial production of FDOPA. In addition to helping
    to bring this valuable imaging agent to market, GFP will assist academic and pharmaceutical

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will determine the technical feasibility and the commercial value proposition for high temperature, highly processable fiber optic coatings across a range of markets to include fiber lasers, fibers for oil and gas, avionics fiber, and medical fiber. Tetramer will perform research to modify the structure of polymer coatings to provide enhanced performance which will extend the capabilities of current fiber optics. Coatings developed will advance our understanding of structure property relationships and establish new boundaries for the polymer system. During this program, Tetramer will synthesize new monomers and polymers and evaluate their properties for use as fiber coatings. At the end of this program, Tetramer anticipates it will have developed 3 new types of polymers with a set of performance characteristics which are not available from any one single material today. New fiber coatings will be developed which are capable of operating at temperatures above 300 deg C, having greater processability, and for laser applications, having lower refractive indices.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will impact society in many ways due to the various markets in which the coatings can have a meaningful impact on the optical fiber performance. Fiber optic lasers are quickly becoming the preferred method for laser fabrication. By enabling fiber lasers to operate at higher temperatures, fiber lasers will immediately see increased output powers and longer service lifetimes. With applications in industrial metal working (welding, cutting, and engraving/marking), micromachining, and medical devices, doubling power output via improved coatings will have a major impact across many industries. Higher temperature fiber coatings will improve down-hole drilling and the overall efficiency of oil drilling operations through better temperature monitoring in deep wells. This has the potential to lower prices of oil and increase oil production. Additionally, these fibers can aid in geothermal well monitoring which would provide a green source of energy. The coatings under development have the potential to generate increased revenue and profit throughout the value chain through increased performance of products and enhanced market sizes through enhanced capabilities. Tetramer will also use this Phase II program to train undergraduate and graduate level students from nearby Clemson University

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the technology research and development necessary to bring wireless instrumentation and smartphone technology used for feedback to lower-limb amputees about their real-time performance, for rehabilitation in situ. The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the opportunity to transform the field of rehabilitation and to advance healthcare by enabling a fundamental shift toward low cost, ubiquitous rehabilitation that can be used away from the clinic. This proposal will research and develop the pre-market alpha- and beta-prototypes of an instrumented insole, smartphone app, and HIPAA-compliant data transfer and remote server storage and analysis system, as an essential and transformative tool utilized for physical therapy and gait training outside of the clinic. While sensors have become small, inexpensive, and highly available, many research lab applications are limited to proof-of-concept evaluations that involve tethered systems and/or post-processing of the data. This research quantifies the effect of this low-cost, personalized, wireless assistive technology that can be used away from the clinic. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for more complex rehab feedback systems, e.g. using a smartphone to detect gait and provide feedback to an orthotic or prosthetic for muscle stimulation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes the focus on mobility limitations in persons with lower-limb amputations, which affect twice as many minorities as Caucasians. The commercial potential of this wireless assistive technology is vast: with diabetes as the major contributor to amputations, the number of amputees is forecast to triple to 3.6 million by 2050. The knowledge gained can be expanded to impact individuals with a wide variety of mobility limitations, e.g. stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, etc. The orthopedic market ? 773,000 total hip/knee replacements performed annually in U.S. ? is also commercially relevant, as patients must affect an asymmetric gait following fracture repair or joint replacement to reduce weight-bearing on the healing limb. Another significant group are athletes seeking to improve performance or recover from injury through precision gait analysis and real-time feedback. In this Phase II proposal, this research will quantify the effect of this wireless assistive technology by enabling persons with amputations to use individualized proprioceptive feedback and to participate in the design of the personalized feedback methods. This work will enable a wealth of information collected away from the clinic, including a way to investigate how and whether patients follow treatment protocols.

    and math) and robotics interest in young people. The project's intent is to address
    the growing skilled labor shortage in STEM fields and prepare learners for the
    cross-industrial rise of robotics. Through exposure to experiential STEM learning,
    the project will create a groundswell of student interest and aptitude that will
    help close STEM workforce gaps in the long term, as well as plant the seeds for
    a future cohort of robotics professionals. The project's hypothesis is that its
    game-based VR-enhanced learning platform can reliably instill design/engineering
    thinking skills into learners while exceeding the capabilities of existing educational
    tools in terms of scalability and adaptability to student needs. The project is
    additionally intended to drive K-12 VR hardware adoption by providing a compelling
    and teacher-customizable solution that will justify institutional hardware investments.
    When proven scalable, the project will act as a beachhead for other VR and game-based
    learning entrants to bring their own innovative learning content into the K-12
    ecosystem, simultaneously promoting the progress of science in alignment with
    the NSF's mission, as well as providing a broad economic lift to the American

    will provide students with a first-of-its-kind immersive robotics sandbox that
    allows for hands-on experimentation. Players will be able to form hypotheses,
    build robots, test, and iterate, mirroring the processes of project-based robotics
    and maker programs. Beyond robot construction, the project will offer challenge
    courses that test players' ability to build to specification. Each course will
    require a different physics-based solution for which a capable robot must be constructed.
    For example, a course might challenge players to navigate a set of stationary
    obstacles and then place a cube on a pressure plate, requiring a robot with maneuverability
    and the ability to pick up, transport, and place objects. This task serves as
    a model of the underlying dynamics of engineering design: identifying a problem,
    thinking critically, and developing a solution engineered specifically to that
    problem. To establish this project in the larger context of teaching media, it
    will be developed as a desktop-only intervention, a VR-only intervention, a desktop/VR
    hybrid intervention, and a paper-based control intervention. These variants will
    be tested with middle school and high school end users to verify the efficacy
    of game-based VR as a pedagogy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is the development of a comprehensive physiological monitoring platform that provides individuals working in hazardous occupations, such as firefighters, with longitudinal and real-time physiological monitoring that includes predictive diagnostics. Because existing physiological monitoring products are cost-prohibitive for most fire and emergency service agencies, and 50% of firefighter deaths are due to sudden cardiac events, this technology offers fire-service agencies an affordable mechanism for addressing this critical problem. Multiple studies have shown that early detection of an irregular heart-rate event (arrhythmias) offers a significant advantage in preventing and treating further CVD. The proposed technological innovation would consist of a wearable physiological monitoring device, which will use a range of networking mechanisms to communicate with a user-friendly analytical platform. Further, the integration of a self-alert system into a wearable patch would support a standalone operation even if there were to be a communication lag between a firefighter and command center. Early detection of arrhythmias and promoting corrective actions could reduce each individual cardiovascular disability claim by about $325,000.

    The proposed project aims to reduce the economic and social costs associated with firefighter injuries and fatalities due to underlying cardiovascular-disease and the extreme physiological strain resulting from the hazardous occupational environments in which fire services personnel work. The affordability of the proposed technology would not only improve occupational safety in the industry, but also enable scientists to further scientific knowledge about the interrelationships between oxygen saturation, ECG values, and extreme heat and physiological stress by using this technology to conduct experimental and field-based research. The longitudinal analysis possible with this platform would also give scientists the tools necessary to research the relationships between physiological stress and human performance factors, to gain a deeper understanding about critical factors in mechanisms such as decision making, risk perception, and communication. These factors are frequently cited in National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) after incident investigations of firefighter fatalities, along with playing important roles in the operating procedure standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new class of soft, flexible, nonabrasive sensing elements which provides precise temperature readings to positively impact the health and mobility of diabetic patients. The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.

    The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project aims to create and test a game-based intelligent
    tutoring system that both assesses and improves the behavioral readiness and social
    emotional skills of Kindergarten and 1st grade students. Research has shown that
    early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for
    success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved
    social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including
    those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately
    impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed
    by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional
    learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible,
    and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students
    as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly
    translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention
    that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible
    with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based
    and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded
    instruction. \n\n\nThis project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent
    Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social
    emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science
    and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models
    where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented.
    However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like
    social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and
    what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several
    significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but
    may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations
    are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively
    enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more
    student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate,
    leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance
    the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition
    to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this
    SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.\n\nThis

    This SBIR Phase II project will enable the development of the first known commercial medical ultrasound device utilizing air-coupled Capacitive Micromachine Ultrasound Transducer (CMUT) technology to diagnose otitis media. Otitis media is the number one indication for which antibiotics are prescribed for children, and the number one cause for surgery in childhood, costing $15+B annually in the US and resulting in 30M annual doctor visits in the US alone. Clinical studies show a diagnostic error rate averaging 50%. Today's tools are unable to accurately determine the presence, and much less the type, of effusion in the middle ear. This leads to significant over- prescription of antibiotics, over-referrals to specialists, and unnecessary surgeries. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. is developing a simple and sensitive medical device to provide diagnostic data to quickly and accurately diagnose both presence and type of otitis media.

    The work of this project will establish fast and economical assessment of CMUT sensor manufacturing performance, by electrical and acoustic measurements. OtoNexus will design and construct test systems to rapidly evaluate electrical and acoustical performance of CMUT sensors as an assessment of production quality. The Electrical Vector Impedance (EVI) test fixture provides an electrical surrogate measure for acoustic output, which can be performed rapidly at the wafer-level with 100% sampling. The Acoustic Output Measure (AOM) test fixture evaluates the pressure emitted by CMUT, and other acoustic performance parameters, after speculum final assembly. This project will develop test fixtures, methods, and processes for assessing production reliability and process consistency. The OtoNexus ultrasound device will be marketed to pediatricians and other primary care physicians, and will decrease prognostic uncertainty and resultant over-prescription of antibiotics, and place the tools for more accurate diagnosis into the hands of the very first clinician the patient sees. This will reduce costs by decreasing both antibiotic usage and specialist referrals and will also decrease required physician time by enabling a nurse or other physician extender to perform the test for otitis media.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a suite of screen-printed receive coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that are flexible, lightweight, low-cost and adapted to the entire population from infants to adults. MRI is widely used to establish a broad variety of clinical diagnosis, but suffers from long examination times and a high rate of failure, resulting in a yearly loss of more than $4 billion in the United States alone. Printed receive coils are extremely flexible, lightweight, and conform well to the human body. With this technology, coils can be designed and manufactured inexpensively to fit all patient sizes, thus improving image quality and enabling robust acceleration of the method. These benefits can contribute to increase the success rate of MRI exams, speed up procedure time, enhance the clinical workflow, and reduce equipment costs. Printed coils will improve the quality of care offered by MRI suites and increase the availability and use of MRI to a wider patient population. Overall, this project will develop a clinical-ready system capable of delivering the full economic and clinical benefits of printed coils, which will contribute to a reduction of the healthcare costs associated with MRI.

    This project aims to fully realize a clinical-ready system consisting of a collection of printed, flexible lightweight MRI coil arrays, and connecting to a single universal cable to interface with the MRI scanner. A first part of the project will focus on the design of the cable and the associated connection scheme allowing interchange of multiple printed coil arrays of different sizes. Different strategies will be examined with the intent of maintaining high performance and safety while maximizing the advantages brought by printing. A second project goal will focus on the development of a collection of printed coil arrays for patient sizes ranging from newborn to adult, that are compatible with the universal cable and for both 3T and 1.5T scanners. The arrays will be designed for body imaging and will consist of 32-channel devices divided into 16-channel posterior and anterior portions. Their performance will be compared to a commercial 32-channel product. The final system will meet all the safety requirements for medical use and will be ready to be manufactured at scale.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a new tool for the analysis of in situ indican precursor in indigo plants, which when combined with genomic analysis and genetic linkage mapping in selectively bred indigo crops, will lead to high indican yielding breeding parental lines and ultimately competitively price natural indigo dye.  Additionally, characterization of genetic markers will accelerate further crop improvement by understanding and harnessing the genes crucial to indican synthesis and other aspects of significance to overall indigo yield. These advancements will benefit customers, denim mills, by leading to a more reliable, lower cost plant-derived indigo supply. The success of this multiphase STTR project will enable a cost-competitive, cleaner, and more sustainable denim dyeing process, while greatly expanding the market for domestically produced natural indigo.  Commercialization of a more consistent and higher yielding US-grown indigo plant that produces high purity indigo powder can replace the current standard of synthetic, imported indigo powder. While in demand by the marketplace today, plant-derived indigo is currently only used in premium denim products due to the high cost per pound resulting from low yields per plant per acre. The direct result of this research will be to open new market segments and expand existing market penetration for US-grown and manufactured biobased indigo for the textile industry, an addressable market of $1.86B. The methods and technology developed through this project have a direct path to the commercial marketplace and the industry is ready to support biobased textile dyes such as plant-derived indigo.

    During this project, reference genome resources will be constructed for indigo feedstock crops, F1 mapping populations will be constructed for P. tinctoria, I. tinctoria, and I. suffruticosa varieties, and design of the handheld rapid assay device will be validated through laboratory analysis. The reference genome for I. suffruticosa will be built using Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and assembly.  In addition to this reference genome, whole-genome resequencing will be performed on available I. suffruticosa and I. tinctoria varieties.  Nucleotide variation and variant effect prediction will be made between the Indigofera-based indigo varieties.  This variation will be used to develop markers to evaluate intervarietal crosses. Controlled greenhouse crosses of three species will be made to create F1 mapping populations for use in constructing a genetic map and linkage mapping, in combination with the resources developed.  Intraspecies varieties exhibiting distinct phenotypic traits of commercial interest or notable dye yield differences will be selected for crossing to generate the F1 populations. Results from laboratory-based fluorometry equipment will be evaluated for efficacy and then compared against extractive indigo dye analysis from the leaf biomass.  A final prototype will be constructed based on these findings and validated through use in the laboratory and in the field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project can lead to a revolution in 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces at the micron-scale range. The proposed technology will significantly improve photorealistic rendering in digital prototyping, and therefore reduce the waste from using physical material samples during design, engineering, and manufacturing. This technology will help reduce product development time and cost, and lead to a greater sustainability.

    The proposed project will develop a computational imaging system that allows for high-resolution 3D microgeometry and reflectance properties measurement of object surfaces. The current approaches for 3D surface measurement at the micron scale are based on sophisticated optical and mechanical components that are expensive and can be difficult to use, and most of these approaches cannot capture the full appearance of a surface, such as diffuse reflection, specular reflection, and surface roughness. The goal of this research program is to develop a combination of hardware and software that can measure 3D surface microgeometry and reflectance properties with micron-scale accuracy. The proposed technology is expected to achieve superior performance at greatly reduced cost.

    Research (SBIR) project is multilayered. First, there is the potential for creation
    of a carbon nanotubes manufacturing industry in the United States that will create
    hundreds of high-paying domestic manufacturing jobs advance U.S. leadership and
    knowledge in industrial electrochemistry. Secondly, Saratoga Energy's technology
    has the potential to benefit the United States economy by increasing the cost-competitiveness
    and performance of lithium-ion batteries, paving the way to the broader adoption
    of electric vehicles and grid/renewable energy storage. In turn, this will help
    reduce the strategic importance of oil, the cost of securing global oil supplies,
    as well as greenhouse gas emission. While lithium-ion batteries are the focus
    of this body of work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are also used in a variety of other
    applications - advanced composite materials, nanotechnology, catalyst supports,
    water filtration, and other areas of commercial impact. \n\nThis SBIR Phase II
    project proposes to 1) electrochemically characterize carbon nanotubes as a cathode
    conductive additive for high-performance lithium-ion battery applications and
    2) construct a small pilot-scale carbon nanotube manufacturing unit capable of
    producing 1 kg of product per day for retail distribution. Saratoga Energy Research
    Partners, LLC (Saratoga Energy), has developed a high-selectivity electrochemical
    process to convert carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes. In the work conducted
    thus far, Saratoga Energy has established that its carbon nanotubes can be manufactured
    at a cost ~50X cheaper than the market price for state-of-the-art battery-grade
    carbon nanotubes.  Battery manufacturers use carbon nanotubes to enable the reduction
    of conductive additive content in the cathode, thus improving specific and volumetric
    energy density. Carbon nanotubes also act as a reinforcing agent in the electrodes
    improving their mechanical properties. This is important for the battery assembly
    process but also for battery life performance, as the carbon nanotube network
    maintains a high level of cohesion of the electrodes upon repeated charge-discharge
    cycles. However, today, the high price of commercial carbon nanotubes limits their
    use, which will be addressed by our lower cost CNTs.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be observed through a direct reduction in
    the energy consumption required by large industrial facilities, commercial buildings,
    campuses, and homes. Due to reduced cooling demands as a result of carefully designed
    radiative properties, the sustainability of federal and industry facilities will
    be significantly improved with the installation of passive radiative composite
    (PRC) roofing material for building energy management. The market demand for cool
    roofing materials has exceeded $1 Billion, annually, and is expected to grow with
    increasing need and return on investment. PRC roofing material can expect to compete
    in a growing industry due to non-trivial improvement over state-of-the-art options
    in commercial cool roofing products and the economic fabrication method identified
    in the PRC conceptual design stage. Opportunities extend beyond structural thermal
    management to a variety of cooling needs including refrigerated transportation
    and storage. The development of PRC roofing will advance understanding and use
    of spectrally-selective materials designed for intelligent control of thermal
    radiation. \n\nThe proposed project will provide critical design, testing, and
    experimental validation needed to transition PRC technology into the commercial
    sector. Designs based on electromagnetic and thermal modeling include composite
    material options capable of providing passive radiative flux of over 100 Watts
    per square meter of installed material. This passive cooling advantage, relative
    to current commercial cool roofing materials, is expected to create significant

    structures. PRC material properties designed to be spectrally selective offer
    the opportunity for intelligent thermal management through reflection of solar
    and near-infrared portions of the radiative spectrum, while emitting strongly
    in the 8-13 micron atmospheric transmission window. A primary objective of the
    SBIR project is to optimize PRC designs considering full spectrum properties with
    three criteria in mind: thermal efficiency improvement, durability, and large
    batch manufacturing economy. Demonstration of PRC-based roofing materials on full-scale
    test structures will quantify passive cooling power and robustness to weathering,
    positioning PRC-based roofing for introduction by a commercial manufacturing partner.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable vast deployment of energy storage to increase installation of renewable energy for reduced pollution and greenhouse gases, to improve energy security, and to improve energy efficiency and safety. The project will realize a dramatic reduction in cost and size of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) that will allow penetration of ESS into markets served by fossil fuels. One key market is grid ancillary services which includes Frequency Regulation (FR) that regulates grid frequency and stability. With the potential of this project, the FR market for battery based ESS is expected to grow from $100M/yr to over $4B/yr. This project has the societal benefits of replacing fossil fuel based ?peaker? plants that are commonly used to perform FR, with clean Li-ion battery based ESS. Furthermore, by providing lower cost FR capability for the grid, the project will enable grid penetration of more renewable energy, which requires additional FR capability.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a highly compact integrated modular inverter/energy storage system to revolutionize deployment of energy storage system for grid, micro-grid, energy efficiency, and energy reliability support. The development effort proposed here includes an advanced energy storage system consisting of an extremely compact 150kW high frequency 3-level inverter, an integrated 100kWhr compact Li-ion battery system, proprietary battery management systems and internet communications capability. This will provide a highly integrated and scalable 150kW Energy Storage System with an integrated battery string inverter with 60% reduced system cost and 10X reduced size that will open new markets for energy storage and renewable energy. The project will develop key technology innovations which work together with advanced Li-ion batteries to form a revolutionary new product. These innovations include: high frequency 3-level inverter with innovative high frequency control and output filter to achieve >10X reduction in volume; a novel topology that integrates inverters into each cell string and eliminates many components resulting in 60% system cost reduction; a modular and scalable design that is fault tolerant and allows easy optimization for multiple system uses.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to transform the lives and future economic opportunities of young people and their communities through democratized access to cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Daily life, economies, innovation, and national security all depend on having a strong and skilled STEM workforce. For this workforce to exist, our schools must provide the necessary education and experience to prepare students for such careers. Unfortunately, a vast majority of K-12 educators today are not equipped with the resources to do so successfully. The importance of solving this problem cannot be overstated; developing a plentitude of competent STEM professionals is critical to ensure economic and security stability. These project goals are aligned with NSF?s mission to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; and to secure the national defense. The resulting technology innovation is of potential service to more than 50 million primary and secondary school students and 3.5 million educators nationally, with an ability to impact their course of study, improve STEM outcomes, increase hands-on project-based experience, and improve future economic opportunities.


    This technology innovation emerges at the intersection of cloud-based software technology, real-time collaboration tools, and learning management systems. This reimagined technology tool easily connects, attracts, and fosters delivery of cross-curricular, educational computing literacy resources aligned with national and state educational standards. The project aims to empower and support educators and students in tackling the many new opportunities and growing number of resources in computer science (CS) and engineering education at home, in classrooms, and in community centers. As the CS education landscape evolves with new and exciting technical curriculum, this innovation analyzes the willingness of educators to create or adopt new computer science education, the effectiveness of real-time collaboration tools on CS education outcomes, and measures student awareness and feelings about computer science and engineering disciplines. This technology innovation promotes customer participation and a unique ability to provide support at the ground level in real-time. There are solutions that provide massive online CS courses and curricula; however, none targeting K-12 classrooms or educators which support and integrate cross-curricular computer science, engineering, and cybersecurity education. Offering cloud-based, synchronous technology tools this technology enables real-time, expert mentoring and pair-programming in a K12 virtual learning environment on a massive scale.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase overall crop health and production with the proposed smartphone compatible crop health sensor. More specifically, crop disease remains a significant threat to global food security, and with the ability to perform pre-visual screening, the proposed platform enables cost efficient, quantitative detection of crop disease, empowering farmers to take action to reduce disease impact. Initially the sensor platform provides a timely solution for cost effective, high throughput, and pre-visual screening of citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), enabling citrus growers to effectively manage HLB in their groves and remain profitable. The pre-visual, cost efficient and quantitative detection capability also translates to detection of diseases in other crops. In addition, the sensing technology developed can be used for quantitative assessment of crop nutrient and water stress, enabling farmers to optimally manage crop health, providing a means to optimize profits, increase crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts. This is critical to ensuring national and global food security, and protecting national water supplies by reducing eutrophication of water bodies due to misdiagnosis and mistreatment of crop stressors.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is built upon Atoptix?s patented compact self-referenced spectrophotometer design, which reduces the size and cost of an optical spectrophotometer to enable field use and integration with smartphone technology. For each spectral measurement, the sensor simultaneously records a self-referenced spectrum, retaining the sensitivity and reliability generally reserved for costlier and bulkier spectrophotometer designs, but also enabling a non-technical user to collect data in the field at the push of a button. Distinct from surface reflection methods, the proposed sensor enables pre-visual detection of a pathogen, as it only captures light that has penetrated inside of a leaf and interacted with internal structures. By lowering the cost of the optical sensor through patented designs, increasing ease of use via a smartphone, and joining the precision of optical spectroscopy with machine learning based analytics, the proposed sensor can enable widespread adoption by growers in disease prone regions, where community wide screening is key for protecting grower assets.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the need to reduce the time associated
    with conducting tests currently used to establish targeted antibiotic (and dose)
    to treat infections.  Sepsis and septic shock are one of the leading contributors
    to death in US Hospitals, responsible for 250,000 deaths annually (estimated at
    30-50% of all hospital deaths).  To combat these high death rates, time is of
    the essence.  The administration of targeted (versus broad-spectrum) antibiotic
    therapy in the first five to six hours of septic shock increases the likelihood
    of survival by roughly fifty percent.  This project combines electronics and microchannel
    fluidics to rapidly obtain results on antibiotic susceptibility.  The project
    requires engineering, software development, and method development, resulting
    in an instrument that utilizes disposable cards to conduct the testing.  The resulting
    product will allow transition from broad spectrum to targeted antibiotic therapy
    faster (1 day - weeks), leading to major benefits: (1) patient outcomes are greatly
    improved by faster transition to directed antibiotic therapy; (2) Reduced hospitalization
    stays (reduced intensive care stays), resulting in significant monetary saving
    for healthcare systems (estimated at a cost savings of at least $3.75B annually).
    \ (3) Reduced broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy reduces the current fostering
    of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings globally. \n\nThis project uses
    Microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to measure the \"bulk capacitance\"
    (Cb) of a suspension. Cb is a measure of the amount of charge transiently accumulated
    at the membranes of living cells in a suspension. Cell proliferation results in
    an increase in Cb, whereas cell death results in a decrease.  Using m-EIS to measure
    bacteria in the presence of candidate antibiotics and doses, is robust, sensitive,
    and extremely fast, determining, in real time, cell growth, stasis, or death (in
    approximately 4 hrs).  This project will develop a rapid, direct-from-sample,
    inexpensive commercial system. This is achieved by using commercial MNPs to isolate
    microorganisms from clinical samples such as blood culture broth, urine, sputum
    etc., and re-suspending the pathogens in specified volumes of growth media to
    obtain a suspension containing optimized concentrations of bacteria.  Pathogen
    growth or death is then monitored using m-EIS in microfluidic cards where they
    are exposed to a range of antibiotic concentrations. The result is a phenotypic
    antibiotic susceptibility (AST) profile, yielding the minimal inhibitory concentration
    (MIC) of multiple candidate antibiotics within 4 hours of sample collection. The
    AST and MIC information is then used to treat infections with targeted therapeutic.
    \ The first products utilizing this system/method will focus on urine and positive
    blood culture broth samples.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will extend to a number of applications, including smart buildings, home automation, and security. The development of this new technology for efficient indoor sensing, and development of new algorithms for occupancy sensing and counting techniques, will have immediate implications in the building automation and home construction industries, where improved occupancy sensing is necessary to achieve the promise of Smart Buildings that adjust environmental conditions such as lighting and air conditioning automatically to suit the needs of the occupants. Implementing this false-alarm free technology will realize millions of dollars in cost savings from reduced energy use. Such energy savings would impact the US energy independence while helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to "smart building"/energy efficiency applications there are also significant opportunities to apply these highly-reliable and difficult-to-defeat sensors to facility security, military, law-enforcement/correctional facilities and in-home care monitoring. This project represents Broadening Participation: As a woman-owned minority business in an underrepresented geographical location (Hawaii), the success of Adnoviv will bring opportunity for graduate students through our relationship with the University of Hawaii and encourage young girls to enter Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields.

    This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will result in a revolutionary advance in occupancy sensing for smart buildings and energy-use reduction by providing a low-cost sensor capable of real human presence detection and occupant count and eliminating the issues that have limited the utility of occupancy sensors in many applications. The feasibility of using radio frequency Doppler radar to detect human cardiopulmonary activity and estimate number of occupants using a low power system-on-chip (SoC) platform will be demonstrated. In particular, reliable occupant detection without false alarms, and occupant count estimation will be investigated to further enhance energy savings potential, especially in conjunction with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. The significant commercial potential of such True Presence Occupancy Detection Sensors in energy-saving applications will be demonstrated in partnership with one of the largest building automation companies in the world.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will address two societal needs. It will enable mass charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) at minimal cost, and will enable the provisioning of energy services to help integrate renewable energy
    sources. This is critical as electricity generation and transportation together consume close to two-thirds of all US energy and emit more than half of all US greenhouse gases. To drastically reduce greenhouse gases will therefore require electrification of our
    transportation and renewable generation of our electricity. California (CA) has a mandate to have 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles by 2025 and, currently, half of the nation's EVs are in CA. If the project is successful, the proposed technology, when deployed at scale,
    can potentially save CA $144M annually in operating costs and $1.1B in capital cost when CA reaches its ambitious goal by 2025. This can help reduce greenhouse gases annually in CA by 5.5 million metric tons. This project will therefore make an impact in both clean
    transportation and clean energy.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will develop an adaptive EV charging system that can implement a number of innovations that are not currently available in the EV charging industry. It will offer a site host a solution to recover costs,
    jointly optimize onsite distributed energy resources such as solar panels and battery banks, minimize operating cost for site host and charging cost for drivers, and optimally trade off preferences and constraints of different drivers and of the site host, subject to
    infrastructure capacity constraints. These technologies will be based on unique real-time sensing, communications, and control capabilities, as well as advanced optimization and learning algorithms. These technologies will provide a target charging capacity at minimal infrastructure and operating costs, as well as a platform for energy services to the grid.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) project is to allow for the recycling of valuable materials from
    complex wastes that today cannot be recovered. The commercial impact from this
    innovation is to allow for complex waste streams that contain multiple materials,
    such as textiles, to serve as the source of raw materials for the manufacture
    of new goods in a way that is cost advantaged. This gives those businesses that
    use such raw materials a sustainable alternative and importantly, a lower-cost,
    efficiently produced material. In this way, there will be significant incentive
    for the reuse of thousands of tons of material that today either goes to landfills,
    oceans, or is incinerated for energy, a very low value application. A funded,
    successful project will yield an entirely new framework for recycling of complex,
    multi-component materials.    \n\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop
    novel technologies for fractionating complex wastes. Multi-component wastes such
    as textiles represent upwards of 4% of total landfill volume. Today, there does
    not exist technology for recovering the high-value materials that are in these
    wastes. The proposed project intends to develop a new approach using chemical
    techniques as opposed to simple melt recycling to enable the value-added recycling
    of high value polymers from such wastes. Chemical process development will take
    place in order to take the current status of the technology to implementation
    in a pilot plant. The main technical objective of the proposal is to develop the
    process so as to produce large amounts of consistent, high purity product. Materials
    such as polyester and nylon cannot be separated from natural or cellulosic fibers
    such as cotton or other textile materials. The goals of the research are to develop
    the proposers' current process for fractionating the synthetic resins with an
    emphasis on achieving high purity products at larger volumes. To this end, various
    chemistry and chemical engineering techniques will be investigated for exclusion
    of impurities from end product polymer at the kg scale.\n\nThis award reflects

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to lay a foundation for vehicle to infrastructure communication focused on applications that add direct value to mobility. Many solutions are focused on getting information to the vehicle, while it is often the infrastructure that requires vehicle information to operate more efficiently. Currently, traffic signals enforce the right-of-way of everyone regardless of in-vehicle technology. This is why optimizing their effects on the road network can provide tremendous benefit. There are significant benefits to transit as well, like buses and light rail that, when given priority at intersections, improves on-time performance which is a major factor in ridership rates.

    The proposed project advances the work of the joint standardization of the National Transportation Communications for Intelligent Transportation Systems Protocol (NTCIP) to achieve interoperability between various traffic signal controller vendors to enable shared control and organization between different operating agencies. It is not unusual to have sections of roadway be managed by local, county, and state within the same small area. These overlapping jurisdictions produce fractures within the road network resulting in the asynchronous timing of traffic signals. The aim is to consolidate the management into a signal network capable of coordinating large areas of traffic signals to increase mobility's overall efficiency. With a cloud solution that is capable of speaking to each networked intersection, vehicle telemetry data and route information can be used to proactively optimize signal timing. Working with prioritized vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, and ambulances, pilot studies will be conducted to perform priority and preemption along routes that cross jurisdictions. Each pilot case will be analysed based on key performance indicators set forth by the agencies.

    This SBIR Phase II project will benefit society by reducing the cost of manufacturing biologic pharmaceuticals and improving their quality, including pharmaceuticals that are currently too costly to manufacture because they target relatively small patient populations. In order to accelerate the availability of newly discovered drugs, the pharmaceutical industry and federal regulatory agencies have identified a great need for advances in process analytical technologies (PATs) in biomanufacturing. This project will advance state-of-the-art PAT by providing a continuous in-situ sensor enabling novel methods of drug quality assurance. This multi-analyte sensor will allow biopharmaceutical companies, for the first time, to monitor the concentration of the product in-situ as it is being produced along with the concentrations of other important cell culture conditions. This ability unlocks new avenues for optimizing biopharmaceutical production which consumes about 35% of the biologic drug cost-of-goods. Efficient control of upstream processes using sensors such as the one proposed here is expected to reduce these costs by up to 30%. Furthermore, this technology can be directed towards other analytes by replacing the bound affinity ligands. Thus, this technology can be used as a sensing platform in biopharmaceutical manufacturing or medical diagnostics, food processing, and water quality monitoring.

    This project will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing, hydrogel chemistry, and process analytics by developing the first continuous monoclonal antibody (mAbs) sensor suitable for biomanufacturing. Remarkable progress has been made in developing affinity ligands that specifically bind to targets, but thus far the primary application has been medical therapeutics. This project will develop a biosensor adapting affinity ligands, aptamers in particular, for the first time for application in bioprocess monitoring. This will be accomplished by synthesizing the first antibody-responsive hydrogel containing covalently attached peptide aptamers. Each of the four objectives will focus on hydrogels, electronics, software and system validation respectively. The mAb biosensor will be capable of monitoring quality and yield of mAbs besides the key parameters: pH, osmolality, glucose, and lactate in cell culture environments. This novel hydrogel will be the basis for the first in-situ bioreactor sensor for real-time antibody measurements during biomanufacturing. This adaptable technology can be leveraged towards a number of protein targets; thus, this project represents a transformative approach that will advance scientific knowledge of biosensing across a multitude of applications. Thus, the proposed sensor array will be a powerful tool to advance process analytics and biomanufacturing.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a personalized learning environment for guiding students in effective use of educational sketching in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM). There is an estimated need for 1 million more STEM professionals in the U.S. over the next decade. However, the dropout rate for students in STEM majors ranges from 48% to 69%. Recent reform in mathematics education in the U.S. has focused on sketching and modeling so that students have a better understanding of the problems they are solving rather than rote memorization. Sketching is also important for improving the ability to visualize three dimensional shapes in engineering, medicine, and science. Teaching sketching has been shown to increase retention in STEM by over 50% among students entering college with low spatial visualization skills, especially among women and other underrepresented minorities. However, the traditional method of sketching on paper requires teaching expertise and classroom time, which has limited its use. Our touchscreen software will improve upon sketching on paper, by providing immediate feedback and intelligent hints when students are stuck. A key advantage of our approach is that it can reward persistence by having students retry a sketching assignment until they get it right, as opposed to multiple-choice questions that can only be tried once. Impact will include improved conceptual understanding in K-6 mathematics and STEM education at all levels.


    This project will develop an intelligent learning environment where students can freehand sketch on a touchscreen phone, tablet, or computer. They will receive personalized feedback based on the sketches they draw to improve their conceptual understanding and promote persistence. The software algorithms developed will automatically grade student sketches and provide hints that are just enough to keep the student engaged but not so much as to give away the solution. An expert teacher knows that developing skill and increasing persistence requires that students struggle a bit as they overcome obstacles to learn new concepts. The algorithm for interpreting student sketches and providing hints will mimic an expert teacher looking over the shoulder of the student. By interpreting student intent in their sketches, the algorithm will be able to distinguish between intentional marks and unintentional ones that are due to poor coordination or sloppiness. Subject areas include elementary school mathematics, spatial visualization for 7-12th grade technical education, post-secondary vocational and engineering programs, and eventually physics, geology, medicine and other STEM areas. This project will replace sketching on paper and pencil with widely available touchscreens, and make educational sketching more effective and engaging.

    This SBIR Phase II project will develop a drug delivery technology to address the unmet need of antiproliferative drug delivery below-the-knee. In the United States, there are 323,000 new critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients each year. CLI is the most severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis of the lower limbs. Ultimately, 40% of CLI patients will undergo lower limb amputation as a result of CLI, half of whom will then die within a year. Existing technologies have failed in these vessels, resulting in higher rates of patient amputation. This project will create a better intravascular drug delivery tool to treat PAD patients after angioplasty. This improved drug delivery will provide three key societal benefits: 1) reduced costs and greater efficiency when revascularizing the vessels of critical limb ischemia patients, 2) a reduction in healthcare costs by reducing repeat procedures, and 3) improved patient outcomes resulting from improved drug delivery achieved using image guidance. If successful, this technology may improve patient health while reducing treatment costs for millions of patients around the world. This will also improve understanding of what aspects of CLI treatment are most effective by offering the flexibility to vary different aspects of drug delivery. When completed, this project will enhance the understanding of intravascular drug delivery with ultrasound and microbubbles.

    This project will provide strong technical innovation through a new ultrasound drug delivery device and new methods to evaluate cardiovascular drug delivery devices. Using a combination of intravascular ultrasound and drug loaded microbubbles, this project will provide better localization of delivery with lower drug doses. This project will then evaluate the drug delivery platform using realistic models of human disease from donated tissue combined with routine techniques (histopathology) and more recent advances (microCT) to evaluate the effect of the disease on drug delivery. The core research objective of this project is to deliver paclitaxel to human diseased arteries with the new intravascular ultrasound and microbubble drug delivery platform. It is anticipated that this project will result in an improved drug uptake over the existing technologies in diseased arteries where drug uptake is poorest. The data and techniques from this project will be used to compel adoption among interventionalists and to validate the the drug delivery system as a tool to prevent amputations in CLI patients.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes development of berry post-picking screening and handling that will provide a safe and efficient way to remove contaminated berries from the processing stream of an automated harvester. The project will advance machine vision technology for robotic harvesting and will be a key enabling technology leading to acceptance of automated harvesting as safe and effective. The market sector addressed by this project is strawberry farmers, though the technology will be applicable to other types of fruit and vegetable farming as well. The automated harvesting technology advanced by this project will alleviate chronic and worsening labor shortages faced by strawberry farmers and will ensure that strawberries remain affordable and available to consumers. Filling the need created by farming labor shortages is a $1 billion business opportunity.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop new vision processing and inspection methods vital to enabling use of an automated, robotic strawberry harvester. Acceptance of automated harvesting technology by strawberry farmers hinges on the ability of the harvester to remove bad berries from the plant without allowing the undesirable berries from entering the harvester packaging stream and potentially contaminating large quantities of berries. To achieve this, it will be necessary for the harvester to identify and eliminate diseased, rotten, damaged, or infested berries at multiple stages in the stream from automated picking to final packaging. The classification method that identifies the berries to be eliminated will be extremely accurate, with a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. The methods developed will be suitable for installation on a farming machine that is subject to a harsh outdoor environment as well as the shock and vibration environment found on a robotic harvesting device. New handling processes will be developed that will allow automated inspection of the entire berry without damaging the fruit or creating a risk of cross contamination from infected berries, significantly advancing the state of the art for automated strawberry processing.

    This SBIR Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a transparent, thin multifunctional coating for corrosion and biofouling prevention on coated surface. Its environmentally friendly product will be an efficient ready-to-use single component product that can be applied with ease, and would dry in ambient conditions without the need for external heating equipment. The global annual expenditure to mitigate corrosion is in the range of $2.5 trillion, roughly equal to 3.4% of the world's GDP. Protecting assets from corrosion is, hence, a critical requirement for all the industries. A broad range of applications can benefit from this coating technology such as aviation industry where removal of toxic chromium compounds from coating procedures is of high priority, automobile manufacturing where extended corrosion protection to vehicles without using toxic treatments is constantly sought, structural engineering where providing long life protection to bridges is always needed, marine engineering where protecting ships from corrosion and not contributing to ecological imbalance is long sought, military where minimizing the maintenance downtime of tanks and guns is of prime importance, hospitals that are interested in longer lasting medical implants, and paints and coating industry that is desiring removal of volatile organic components from their paints and coatings. The proposed coating is expected to offer scratch resistance and oleophobic characteristics in addition to corrosion protection. The initial success of this project will result in two high-volume products.


    This project aims to develop a specialized single-part, ready-to-use, nominally bioceramic liquid coating for protection against corrosion and fouling activities. On application over desired surface, this transparent liquid transforms into hard-yet-flexible coating. This thin coating composition consists of in-place generated nanoparticles of organometallic compounds in the 3D network of polysilsesquioxane. The reactivity of the precursor to coating is designed such that material can react with substrates in ambient conditions and dries to solid film without the need of any external heating. The hardened coating adheres to most surfaces including metals, ceramics, plastics, glasses, and wood. The optimum thickness of coating is approximately ten microns and can impart various desired surface functionalities to the coated object. In this project, efforts are directed towards optimization of current composition to be compatible with broad range of commercially available topcoat materials. The optimized coating composition will be subjected to a rapid properties screening before third party testing, validation and approvals. An extensive field testing will be conducted in collaboration with potential customers. This innovative coating technology will initially result into two products that can be used in place of carcinogenic hexavalent chromium compounds that are currently in use for the corrosion protection of metals. While one of the products would act as a corrosion prevention compound that can adhere to commercial topcoat paints, the other would act as self-cleaning coating to prevent biofouling activities.

    This STTR Phase II project supports standards-based math education in elementary school classrooms with a hands-on technology intervention. Research has shown that many elementary teachers suffer from low confidence and limited subject content knowledge in math and struggle to develop instruction designed to meet or exceed common core math learning goals. Teachers and researchers alike seek new approaches to engage students and improve teacher effectiveness to improve learning outcomes. The primary goal of this project is the development of a flexible, user-friendly, hands-on robotics kit with associated curriculum and support for teachers, that will engage students in learning math content, align with core curriculum, and measurably increase student achievement. The commercialization of this research-based classroom kit will enable school districts to adopt active learning into their math pedagogy. Ultimately, this promotes the NSF mission to increase national prosperity through science innovation by improving math preparation for students across the United States and preparing them to participate in careers that drive the advancement of science and technology.


    The core contribution of this work is composed of a flexible hardware kit to enable active learning within the core elementary curriculum as well as more traditional maker activities, and a suite of apps that allow students to use this kit to learn specific math content while also providing options to learn computational thinking through general purpose programming apps. To accomplish this, the team employs a proven design process in which hardware, software, and curriculum are simultaneously designed to align to learner goals, evaluated in classroom studies, and iteratively refined. The kit will combine the ease of use and simplicity of a regular snap-together style electronics kit with the flexibility of a programmable microcontroller. The apps developed for this project will build on a new math-based paradigm for robot programming. These math-oriented apps will remove the barrier of programming skills for elementary teachers and students alike when using the electronics kit for math instruction. Simultaneously, programming apps will enable open-ended explorations of making and computational thinking. Another contribution of this project will be the testing and analysis of the hardware system and complementary math curricula. Formative evaluation will enable exploration and understanding of novel mechanisms for learning math, and evaluation of the program's efficacy will enable characterization of the impact on student outcomes in math achievement and attitudes towards math.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is a video-based safety system for improving
    the quality and reducing the cost of dementia care. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) affects
    5.4M in the US, including 1 in 9 over 65 and 1 in 3 over 85, and represents two
    thirds of all those affected by dementia. It is the single most expensive disease
    in the US ($236B direct; $221B indirect costs). The size of the US population
    with AD doubles every 15 years. The drug failure rate for AD is among the highest,
    currently 99.6. Fall accidents account for 26% of all AD related hospitalizations
    and are a major concern and key cost contributor, with an average fall rate of
    4 falls per year and 3 in 4 repeated falls. Unfortunately, safety products developed
    for falls were developed for cognitively aware adults and not designed specifically
    for individuals with AD. The proposed system will change the quality of care and
    operations in memory care facilities, increase quality of life for patients and
    families, and help the medical profession gain a better understanding of dementia.
    \n\n\nThe proposed project addresses this critical gap in Alzheimer's care by
    detecting safety critical events, based on camera video where events can be reviewed
    by a human assistant in real-time and after the fact. It is expected to achieve
    two main objectives that advance science and technology: (1) Demonstrating the
    ability for our machine learning algorithms to automatically perform safety critical
    tasks, by learning over a sufficiently rich set of data. These extend existing
    methods for fall detection to include (a) fall prediction; (b) wandering detection;
    (c) bed sores detections; (2) enabling the Company to demonstrate that the system
    proposed can run with a fully operational HIL paradigm running at scale with up
    to 1000 patients in 100 memory care facilities.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will usher new Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) products delivering high accuracy with explainability. Without rationale behind predictions, decision makers can't trust and effectively use AI/ML solutions.  Outcome of R&D through this project would lead to more accurate and faster detection with appropriate explanation of anomalous interactions and recommend effective controls to 1) eliminate billions of dollars of fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) in Health Insurance  markets;  2) lower costs, improve quality and speed of Health Care delivery to consumers; and 3) promote new markets in Personalized Health and Smart Health sector for  emerging Medical Internet-of-Things (IOT) devices and systems, enabling economic growth.  The results of this research are expected to enable the discovery of medical anomaly together with advancing the detection of new types of FWA. The boost in detection accuracy with explanation will save hundreds of millions of dollars. Societal impact includes reduced costs to consumers and taxpayers through better FWA control and advance health outcome through early medical IOT anomaly detection. More broadly, the system is expected to detect possible opioid or substance abuse epidemic cohorts, under/over-medication, advanced alerts for community health anomalies.

    The proposed project will extend and generalize a novel machine learning method to solve the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) problem in health insurance, coupled with explanatory capability providing rational behind predictions and operationalized in a distributed parallel computing framework for scaling. The technical problem is how to combine relations between entities (e.g., doctors) with their attribute (e.g., a doctor's prescription history). This project advances the state of the art by combining relations between rows in the training data (e.g. doctors) with standard machine learning to improve prediction accuracy while facilitating local explanation. The result is vastly improved prediction accuracy with explainability. Thus, the method uses network information to fill in the gaps of entity information alone and vice versa while facilitating explanation for a test case. This method is expected to significantly improve the ability to detect FWA and pave ways for multi Billion dollars savings, call out IOT-based medical anomaly in advance to improve health outcome and build trust in the predictions for the decision makers through the explanations provided. The team intends to deliver not only the accuracy boost with explainability, but a fully operational system with automated data pipeline, parallel and distributed algorithmic processing framework which can be deployed on a SaaS basis or an enterprise solution.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that this research will address the resolution and detection range requirements of autonomous driving in complex environments such as urban scenarios. The next major revolution of transportation is undoubtedly autonomous driving, which will increase safety, mobility and productivity. Fully autonomous transportation may eliminate human error, the leading cause of traffic accidents, and could also lead to reduced traffic congestion, higher energy efficiency, and enhanced mobility for the aging and disabled population. The proposed advanced sensing system with intelligent algorithms is expected to help enable and advance the autonomous driving revolution. The proposed effort will also have great commercial impact. The global market size of autonomous sensors is expected to grow from $5.2 billion in 2018 to $11.9 billion in 2023, with the radar-based sensor segment representing $2.9 billion in 2023. In addition, the expected research outcome may lead to advancements in a number of important market sectors including wireless communications, sensing, mobile internet, assistive technology, and additive manufacturing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to realize a 3D-printed Luneburg lens-based high performance automotive radar for autonomous driving. Existing automotive radars do not have enough distance detection, field of view, and angular resolution for classifying and locating dense targets, which is critical for achieving fully autonomous driving. As a result, current autonomous driving tests utilize LiDAR ((Light Detection And Ranging) systems which are more expensive and less reliable than radar especially under adverse weather conditions such as rain, snow, fog, and smoke. Compared to conventional manufacturing techniques, this project utilizes 3D printing, which is convenient, fast, inexpensive and capable of implementing millimeter wave Luneburg lenses. Based on the Luneburg lens?s ability to form multiple beams with high gain and broad bandwidth, a novel automotive radar will be designed by mounting radar detectors around the lens. Moreover, with the wide bandwidth and natural beam forming capabilities of the Luneburg lens, an adaptive sensing approach is proposed to improve the scanning efficiency and avoid interference from nearby or intruder radar systems. With these proposed approaches, the objective is to achieve a high performance and high value millimeter-wave sensing system suitable for autonomous transportation applications.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require additional care to fully recover - or simply to maintain their health - after being discharged from the hospital. Whether subacute or community-based care, significant opportunity exists to leverage machine learning, decision science, and advance data mining techniques to better support patients. State and federal budgets cover the costs of care for millions of Americans every year. This expenditure is growing faster than inflation, prompting the development of both optional and mandatory payment reform efforts that stand to simultaneously reduce costs and improve care outcomes. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.

    The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon user-centered decision science in healthcare. The proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as claims/billing data from acute, subacute, and community care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will continually refine and move towards production of this project's Creative Maker Tool, an augmented reality experience where the act of playing is inherently inventing. The system uses modern technology to avoid digital screens. Throughout this experience, learners tap into their natural proclivities to make and shape ideas in the non-digital world, and develop the ability to fluently construct new ideas in a technical medium. The commercialization of this project will address two, nationally important issues. First, by scaffolding young learners through progressively bringing their ideas into reality, this project will foster creative confidence: the natural ability to come up with ideas and the courage to act on them. Next, there is a gender gap in innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. Women patent at 40% the rate of men, only 9% of information technology related patents have one or more female inventors, and only 8% of the beneficiaries of incubators meant to commercialize innovations were women. This project will address gender equity issues in the maker community (currently 80% male) and by widening pathways to engage in making.


    The system is composed of a projection system that allows real-time programmable interactions between everyday and virtual objects without a computer screen. Throughout this research, we will create and refine STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics) Apps, which are built-in augmented activities where users create small inventions with everyday objects to code interactions and affect program flow or gameplay, develop Augmented Tutorials, bridge seamlessly to existing STEM tools through real-time interfacing, as well as manufacture and prepare the system.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is that if successful, the results of this project will revolutionize large area LED array assembly manufacturing, leading to unprecedented growth of the direct view LED display market. Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.

    The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.

    This SBIR Phase II project will create an industrial process for bonding ceramics to metals at the molecular level. Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.


    The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.


    The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.

  title: 'SBIR Phase II:  An Affordable Metal Additive Manufacturing Machine'
- abstractText: |-
    This SBIR Phase II effort will create transformative open tools to enable affordable access at scale to high quality assessments (problems & questions) for foundational subjects in secondary and post-secondary education. The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.


    This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.

    Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and commercialize MRA arrays for
    use in 802.11ac/ax WLAN systems and 5G mm-wave systems based on new radio specifications.
    5G systems require exploitation of massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
    technology with a large number of antennas to attain significantly improved spectral
    efficiency, thereby achieving required network capacities and enhanced connectivity.
    Massive MIMO is also needed to overcome severe propagation losses in mm-wave bands,
    where large swaths of spectrum is available. If a MIMO system uses legacy dumb
    antennas with fixed properties, the resulting complexity and cost figures, and
    the power consumption associated with a large number of RF front ends render them
    commercially prohibitive. The MRA array technology delivers 3-10 dB higher array
    gain compared to legacy arrays. Such gains can be used to improve RF coverage,
    increase user throughput, and reduce network costs by lowering the number of RF
    nodes or reduce the cost, size and power consumption of access point equipment
    by lowering the number of antenna elements. This project will deliver the beta
    prototypes of two MRA array modules containing the hardware and control algorithm
    that can be seamlessly integrated with WLAN and 5G small-cell modems.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project are numerous and include commercial, societal, environmental, and educational impacts. Commercially, an innovation of this magnitude would enable flexible design illumination, with great control over light placement, beam shape, stray light, and light pollution, all while decreasing the size and complexity of the optics and fixtures required. This will impact the amount of electricity used for lighting, helping to reduce global energy consumption, preserve our environment, and create economic and societal benefits. This project will also result in the employment several technical personnel to carry out the project's technical goals. Educational outreach will continue to impact the local community, students and researchers at nearby institutions, as well as visitors through seminars and workshops on solid-state lighting, materials research, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the technical results may also inform future materials research in the development of robust materials, components, and device architectures with optimal properties to advance other areas of solid-state lighting research.

    The proposed project is aimed at achieving deployment of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for illumination in the commercial marketplace. Research in the field of solid-state lighting is advancing towards the goal of ultra-efficient and smart lighting. Exploring laser-stimulated phosphor emission could lead to next generation, energy-efficient light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies. Optical modeling and thermal simulations will be used to optimize the optics, phosphor materials, and device architectures to achieve narrow-beam angle, low-etendue, and high color-quality white light sources, while maintaining efficient operating temperature. Secondary components will be designed, including the electronics, packaging, heat sinks; compatibility tested with fixtures and manufacturing processes; and implementation into a light engine compatible in design and functionality with customer-specific applications. Regulatory, safety, and performance testing will be completed to achieve industry-specific standards, by working with regulatory bodies to test lifetime and durability in operating conditions, implementation of safety mechanisms, and photometric testing to ensure performance metrics. Lastly, planning, partnerships, execution, data collection, and reporting of field trail testing of products in real life conditions will result in a fully deployed and tested product, ready for implementation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to develop low-power, low-cost and small
    form factor wireless connectivity solutions, facilitating the deployment of inexpensive and long-lived
    wireless sensors and devices for a diverse set of applications. For instance, it is infeasible to place
    conventional sensors or wireless connectivity on low-cost or disposable items due to the high cost and
    short battery life of wireless communication devices. With the successful completion of this project,
    items ranging from consumer packaged goods to medical consumables and pill bottles could be
    connected to the Internet. Brands and manufacturers could gain previously inaccessible market and
    product insights based on the way products are used, while consumers could enjoy benefits ranging
    from new services and features (such as automated product reordering) to better-designed products
    which more closely fit their needs. By enabling new use cases for wireless connectivity, this technology
    can prompt innovation across many industries.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project introduces a new long-range
    backscatter-based communication technology based on Chirp Spread Spectrum, a wireless protocol
    which can be detected at extremely low signal levels. The low-power wireless system prior to this
    project is comprised of three elements: A passive backscatter-based radio, a first gateway device which
    provides an illumination signal, and a second gateway device which receives the resulting
    backscattered data and forwards data to the Internet. In this project, the passive backscatter-based
    radio will be implemented in an integrated circuit form, realizing the low power and low cost possible
    with this technology. The two gateway devices will be combined into one full-duplex radio device, to
    address the needs of the majority of deployment scenarios. Techniques to localize the backscatter
    radios within the field of the gateway device will be explored. Finally, security challenges will be
    addressed and the system will undergo extensive evaluation and testing.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will research and develop new functional materials for advanced additive manufacturing. The goal of this project is to develop high performance materials for light activated 3D printers. If successful, this will enable new tools for manufacturing and research. Applications of this project would enable affordable, waste-free, and energy-efficient manufacturing with the goal of lowering barriers to innovation. Specifically, this project has the potential to improve the quality of healthcare around the world, by dramatically lowering the costs of designing and manufacturing biomedical devices.

    polySpectra has developed a new class of modular 3D printing resins, capable of manufacturing production-quality parts with tailored geometry and chemical functionality in a single step. This process is called ?functional lithography,? and it unlocks the ability to simultaneously define the form and function of advanced materials. The application of functional lithography to additive manufacturing enables production-ready parts to be directly 3D-printed, whereas existing materials can only make prototypes, mock-ups or toys. The goal of this project is to develop new advanced manufacturing processes using functional lithography, towards direct additive manufacturing of high-fidelity polymer components, devices and hardware.

    Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will focus on the design of the first completely
    automated radio frequency ablation (RFA) system for breast tissue. Of the  approximately
    200,000 breast cancer patients in the US who elect lumpectomy annually, over 20%
    must undergo re-operation due to lack of clear margins. Furthermore, many breast
    cancer patients who are treated with lumpectomy require expensive adjuvant radiation
    therapy that can last up to 7 weeks causing time away from work and family. Fortunately,
    performing intraoperative RFA of the lumpectomy cavity has been shown to decrease
    the need for re-operations and radiation therapy by sterilizing tumor margins.
    However, no RFA devices are designed for post-lumpectomy breast cavities or breast
    tissue. The RFA system being developed in this project will automate post-lumpectomy
    RFA, accurately and precisely delivering energy based on local tissue properties
    and desired ablation depth in three dimensions thus customizing treatment for
    each patient. Eventual commercialization of this system could provide early stage
    breast cancer patients new treatment options that improve quality of life, reduce
    burdens of care, and costs while providing breast cancer recurrence control.   \n\nThe
    proposed project aims to develop a system (control unit and device) for optimal
    post-lumpectomy RFA. The proposed device is designed to mechanically fit the post-lumpectomy
    cavity for near-perfect tissue contact. The control unit includes advanced algorithms
    that utilize machine learning to create a three-dimensional ablation status map
    of each margin (ablation vs in-ablated) for controlling ablation. The combined
    system allows the surgeon to customize and monitor the three-dimensional ablation
    profile and automates therapy delivery to ensure accurate, precise ablation results.
    The objectives propose gathering device requirements, identifying critical tasks
    of an automated RFA procedure, and improving the system algorithm by collecting
    training data in cadaveric and prophylactic mastectomy specimens. The intellectual
    merits proposed are: (1) an automated ablation system implemented on an embedded
    microprocessor and co?]processor FPGA capable of ablation shape estimation and

    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to treat chronic back and lower
    limb pain more effectively using a high-resolution stimulation technology.  Lower
    back pain affects more than 100M Americans.  While spinal cord neuro-modulation
    is successful for about 60% of patients, many people remain untreated and suffer
    from chronic pain.  Low-back pain is the most difficult to treat due as conventional
    electrode technology cannot selectively deliver energy to these fibers due to
    the bulky paddle electrode volume associated with the legacy manufacturing processes.
    \ Furthermore, to achieve maximal pain relief, neurosurgeons must wake the subjects
    during an operation to verify if the patient senses pain relief as the electrode
    is positioned.  Many subjects undergo multiple operations due to inaccurate electrode
    alignment or movement of the electrode over time due to physical activity.  The
    proposed active grid electrode technology seeks to double the size of therapeutic
    surface area, including providing therapy to low-back fibers which are not accessible
    by conventional electrodes.  The technology is expected to improve low-back pain
    relief, as well as use wireless programming to alter the therapy in the event
    of electrode movement, avoiding the need for re-operation.  \n\nThe proposed project

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project on hospital service robots is improving the quality of care in hospital systems that are under increased pressure to provide high-quality patient-centric care while functioning as profitable businesses. Hospitals face a shortage of qualified nurses and high rates of nurse turnover. Nurses play a critical role in communicating care plans, educating patients, and guarding against medical errors. The amount of time they spend in direct care activities is a key determinant of patient satisfaction, better patient outcomes, fewer errors, and shorter lengths of stay. In the face of nursing shortages across the U.S., it is increasingly important to have nurses performing at the 'top of their license'. Reducing the amount of time they spend on non-nursing tasks is crucial to this goal. Automation could address these challenges and labor shortage by allowing clinical staff to focus on providing skilled care. The proposed project aims to develop technology that is general-purpose enough to transfer to other markets, such as long term care facilities and, eventually, individual consumers. Robots that perform assistive tasks in homes could increase the feasibility of independent living for many older adults.


    The proposed project will establish the technical and commercial feasibility of developing hospital service robots that act as assistants on acute care units, enabling nurses to spend more time at the bedside with patients. This project will make technical advances along three dimensions: the ability of the proposed robot to autonomously navigate within nursing units and across the hospital (navigation capabilities); to easily adapt its manipulation skills to specific tasks and to physical characteristics of a particular hospital/unit (adaptive learning of manipulation skills); and to work alongside humans in a socially acceptable manner, including appropriate navigation in crowded hallways, speech, and eye gaze behaviors that communicate the robot's intentions (socially intelligent interoperability). The team intends to collaborate closely with a single partner hospital to iteratively improve the reliability and robustness of the artificial intelligence software suite developed with NSF funding and to deploy production-quality versions of the three core competencies. The final 6 months will involve a long-term deployment, with the robot autonomously working on an acute care unit of the partner hospital. The impact of the robot on unit staff and workflows will be documented, with the ultimate goal of developing a service robot that hospital staff view as a competent member of the care team.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to enable and support the future development, approval, and clinical use of new therapeutics the cure HIV-1 infection.  HIV-1 infection can be controlled by available antiretroviral therapy, but cannot be cured due to the persistence of the virus in a quiescent, or latent state.  This latent HIV-1 is the barrier to curing infection.  While latent HIV-1 can be found in all infected individuals, it is present in very low frequencies.  To cure HIV-1 infection, new therapeutics that eliminate latent HIV-1 must be developed.  This development is hindered by current lack of a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in infected individuals.

    The proposed project seeks to develop and optimize a sensitive, accurate, and scalable test to measure latent HIV-1 in the blood of infected individuals.  Current tests used in research laboratories to measure latent HIV-1 are either non-specific or require large volumes of blood and many days to complete.  This project is focused on developing a new molecular test that specifically measures latent HIV-1 from a minimal volume of blood in hours.  Specifically, the project is focused on defining initial test performance and developing critical assay controls needed for robust performance of this new molecular test for latent HIV-1.  Successful completion of this project will yield a latent HIV-1 test prototype that can be advanced to market to support research and early-stage clinical trials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is the development of a user-friendly asthma management solution. The asthma management tool consists of a portable medical device and mobile app combination that measures lung function with the consistency and accuracy of a trained lab technician, displaying current asthma status, and providing health insights to act upon. During the 2-year duration of this proposal, the applicant will further develop a machine-learning algorithm that obtains the same level of consistency and accuracy as if a trained lab technician were coaching and correcting the asthmatic patient on proper usage. Steps will be taken to establish the efficacy of such technology through verification of classification by pulmonologists. In order to engage users to continue using the product over several months, gamification elements will be implemented into the mobile app. By expanding on the machine-model through a longitudinal study, earlier detection of asthma exacerbations may be identified. Early detection leads to improved self-management as measured by the reduction of severe asthma attacks, the use of systemic corticosteroids, hospitalizations, emergency department or urgent care visits related to asthma.

    The proposed project aims to develop an asthma management tool that provides parents a simple way to reliably monitor their child's lung health, eliminating the guesswork associated with relying on symptoms alone. The rate of asthma continues to rise, with an increasing amount of healthcare utilization among asthmatic individuals. Effective technologies for proper management remain trapped within the hospital due to high costs and requirement of a skilled lab technician for proper measurement collection. This proposal aims to develop an algorithm alongside UCSF pediatric pulmonologists to gain consistent and accurate spirometry measurements, so that only proper measurements are acted upon. Our machine-learning algorithm will determine the cause of failure and prompt the user on corrective action to achieve a good quality measurement on a subsequent effort. By the end of this proposal period, the applicant will have a mobile app algorithm that is able to achieve the consistency of a trained lab technician, provide effective corrective feedback, engage users over the span of months for consistent lung monitoring, and potentially predict the onset of an asthma attack.

    This SBIR Phase II project should increase the adoption of pedagogically validated educational games that facilitate retention and effective use of business concepts taught and relevant to managing organizations. Start-ups, for-profit and nonprofit companies all need managers who can make effective decisions in the face of complexity and uncertainty. It is of the utmost importance to society, therefore, that the next generation of business leaders is equipped with relevant frameworks and tools that supplement traditional teaching methods and enable effective use of knowledge on the job. Hence, this project has the potential to empower the U.S. workforce to be more productive and innovative, which will improve existing business outcomes and thus drive U.S. job and economic growth. Improved business operations will also lead to more profitable business in general and potentially larger tax revenues for the U.S. government. Eventually opening the GDL to third-party authors in the $18.6 billion global game-based learning market will accelerate game innovation and usage in other business and engineering disciplines at a lower cost, which will both enhance the effectiveness of the STEM workforce and encourage more economic activity in the game development market.

    This project is based on three innovations that differentiate this solution from others: (1) a scientific Game Research and Development (GR&D) process designs games containing pedagogical learning objectives; (2) a Game Design Language (GDL) accelerates implementation of game concepts as automatically validated, domain specific language while eliminating runtime errors; and (3) an innovative web Game Distribution Platform (GDP) minimizes the effort to setup and manage games in the classroom. Typical educational game development in languages such as JavaScript is time-consuming, involves professional software engineers and requires debugging of runtime errors, while usage of game technology in the class is disruptive to the flow of instruction. Such challenges are therefore prohibitive for non-professional programmers and game administrators such as professors. To mitigate the problem of runtime errors, this project employs methods of video game development, which typically use domain-specific languages based on non-Turing-complete models of computation to solve these issues. Games created with GDL will enable rapid new game development and have a guaranteed level of technical quality, allowing professors to focus on pedagogical relevance during instruction. The main technical hurdle is to tailor these methods to result in GDL capable of expressing the Operations Management (OM) games conceived during the scientific GR&D process and playable via the GDP that enables seamless class integration.

    This SBIR Phase II project continues previous development of an invention disclosure tool that allows users to draft a United States Patent and Trademark Office compliant patent applications by using an intuitive interface and game-based educational tools to draft patent applications. Inventors and small companies having no background in patent law and patent-application drafting strategies struggle with properly describing their inventions.  Overcoming this lack of understanding on the part of the inventor requires a great deal of one-on-one educational training with a patent professional in order to draft a quality patent application. However, engaging a patent professional is costly and time consuming. This project expands the capacity of the invention disclosure software by allowing users to configure and customize the software for specific types of inventions and arts.

    Specifically, this project proposes a new customization tool for integration with the existing invention disclosure tool to allow for widespread adoption into varied technology arts. The customization tool comprises software modules that allow end users to identify and create narrative goals, design software interfaces by configuring display rules, design text output state configurations based on logical operators, design natural language output, design the natural language generated output that is desired for that product type and configure template text, token input, and grammar associations, and determine the position of natural language output into an overall document structure. This customization tool will allow for rapid, scalable distribution of the product to be driven by end users rather than through a traditional software development process, e.g., 1) researching, 2) market testing, and 3) designing and implementing each new version of a product for different technology arts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project lies in the development of a novel cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture footwear. Currently most footwear is mass manufactured, typically overseas, using fixed molds that do not meet the specific needs of an individual. 3D printing of footwear offers the promise of providing individual customization tailored not just to fit, style, and colors, but also to individual biomechanics and/or medical needs. However, a number of technical challenges exist to make 3D printing of footwear sufficiently cost-effective that it can be provided beyond just a select few individuals. This project develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing process to manufacture the critical components of footwear, using readily available and recyclable thermoplastic pellets. This novel 3D printing process will enable the manufacture of new, innovative footwear designs that cannot be made with any other manufacturing process. Additionally, it will make mass customization of footwear a reality, providing access to healthy customizable footwear for many individuals. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes currently being done overseas, this novel manufacturing technology is very amenable to implementing in the United States on a local level. Thus, this project will not only help move footwear manufacturing back to the United States, generating income for tax revenue, it will create entirely new clean, safe jobs in manufacturing.


    This project, led by a woman physician-scientist with a unique combination of expertise in both biomechanics and manufacturing, develops a novel and cost-effective 3D printing technology to print a proprietary mix of elastomeric material into a novel sole design that was developed on the basis of over twenty years of biomechanics research. The primary innovation that is being developed in this project is a specialized plasticizing screw-based extruder mounted on a 3D printer, specifically designed to make footwear, that uniquely and reliably extrudes a recyclable, thermo-elastomeric material that is most suitable for footwear, from its most cost-effective raw form: pellets. This project also develops a novel healthy and customizable sole design, based on the principal investigator's biomechanical research, which can only be made with this manufacturing technology innovation. Finally, this project develops a biomechanically research-based algorithm for customizing footwear made with this technology based on an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or specific medical need. This project will allow for a novel, cost-effective manufacturing process where a bank of 3D printers operate simultaneously, each producing their own made-to-order pair of footwear and/or footwear components customized not only to fit but to an individual's specific biomechanical profile and/or medical need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to demonstrate the feasibility of Battery Resourcers recycling process on a scale that has commercial significance. This will further allow Battery Resourcers to scale its process such that it can be a player in the lithium ion battery recycling market place. Battery Resourcers' ultimate goal is into increase recycling rates of spent Li-ion batteries by providing an economically viable domestic recycling option.  Additionally, Battery Resourcers process produces low cost cathode materials for the battery industry which may ultimately further enable green technologies like solar, wind and electric vehicles.

    This SBIR Phase 1 award proposes to scale the Battery Resourcers recycling process from 50kg to 0.5 tons of spent Li-ion batteries. The proposed research focuses on process speed, safety and the quality of the recovered materials. Rate limiting steps in Battery Resourcers recycling process will be studied with an effort to improve process speed. Specifically, Battery Resourcers will look at new filtering methods for the solutions generated in its process. A method to safety shred Li-ion batteries is examined by controlling the atmosphere and removing the batteries' stored energy. Finally, the production of quality cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries is scaled from 50kg to 0.5 tons.  Battery Resourcers' goal is to produce commercial quality cathode powder on a scale that matters to industry.

- abstractText: "This SBIR Phase II project was initiated as a direct result of extensive
    research into the US math crisis and the complexity of the problem. As a nation,
    we must invest resources directly into the breaking point: the mid school math
    cliff. The US shows the greatest decline worldwide from 4th to 10th grade on International
    tests in math. This project is designed to address all 146 Common Core State Standards
    (and all other state math standards) from 5th to 8th grade, providing a virtual
    reality context for each standard, embedded in an engaging, interactive 3-Act
    math story problem. The theoretical foundation of the project stems from Productive
    Failure, the concept that students perform better when they encounter productive
    failure prior to direct instruction in contrast to the reverse, where instruction
    is given first. Additionally, each simulator directly links student input to functional
    output to show how the math works, specifically allowing students to persist in
    exploring solutions. This project supports the NSF mission to support education
    for all fields fundamental to science and engineering, and holds the potential
    to positively impact a critical problem in U.S. education through broad commercial
    acceptance in schools throughout the US. \n\nThis project is designed to provide
    simulations in a virtual reality context for all standards from 5th to 8th grade,
    using a core software platform for delivery that can be ubiquitously used in classrooms
    throughout the United States. This high-risk technical innovation uniquely embeds
    math content in such a way that input leads to functional output such that students
    can see how the math actually works. Students watch the outcomes of their solutions,
    both the successes and the failures so they can try again. Math problems have
    context and meaning. Students experience the direct results of their mathematical
    abilities, while teachers have the ability to deploy specific problems and receive
    real-time metrics to further respond and support student comprehension. Underlying
    the advanced classroom technology is the pedagogical framework based on Productive
    Failure and the intentional withholding of instruction and information prior to
    direct experience with grappling with a difficult problem with trial and error
    repetition. The goal of the research is to illustrate that math simulations show
    the highest achievement in comparison to other methodologies and that Productive
    Failure is a viable tenant of learning that can be applied to all fields supporting
    higher math applications and scientific discovery."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in development of Ultrasonic Nanocoining - a new platform technology that is used to generate plastic films or glass panels that are anti-reflective, self-cleaning, or colored through structure. Such nano-structured surfaces can provide benefits for a wide array of commercial applications, ranging from consumer electronics to automotive and aerospace. These surfaces can save energy by preventing internal reflections in OLED displays and cover-glass reflections on the surface of solar panels. What?s more, these surfaces enable better use of available space by adding functionality to surfaces without adding any appreciable volume. Nanocoining is a low-temperature, chemical-free process that does not rely on chemical etching or nano-particles, which have recently come under scrutiny from the EPA because of unknown health and environment effects. The science contained within the project spans several disciplines, and Nanocoining would ultimately contribute to low-cost, scalable manufacturing for a wide array of industries.


    Ultrasonic Nanocoining enables low-cost, high volume reproduction of surface textures comprised of nano-structures that are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This is done by creating a cylindrical mold with a nano-structured surface, then imprinting that mold into plastics using roll-to-roll processing. The objectives of the current project are to use Nanocoining to indent billions of sub-wavelength features into both flat and cylindrical Nickel-plated molds in a continuous pattern, then use these molds to replicate the structure into a variety of polymer materials using roll-to-roll processing. The research will study each step of the mold fabrication process, including focused ion beam machining of the diamond die, controlling a dual-mode ultrasonic resonant actuator and registering millions of indents side-by-side without leaving a significant seam between them. Replicated film surfaces will be tested for optical and wetting properties, and the final result will be functionalized transparent film samples that prove commercial potential. In the future the process may be used to create meter-scale nano-structured metal molds for production-scale imprinting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to revolutionize the efficiency of electric motors in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. The innovation technology area is a new class of electric motor and control hardware and software that is based on switched reluctance technology, exhibiting very high efficiencies of 90%+ across a broad range of speeds. This innovation will enhance scientific understanding by showing how this new class of electric motors can be optimized to minimize noise and vibration, while allowing variable speed control and Internet connectivity. The potential societal impacts of such a technology are significant: more than half the new motors purchased each year in the United States are 1-5 horsepower motors (1.024M of 1.792M), and they collectively account for nearly 25% of the United States electricity consumption. As such, if commercialized this technology could save retail and commercial organizations millions of dollars a year in electricity savings due to efficiency improvements. The benefits for an adoption rate of just 5% of available applications are $500M / year in electricity savings and 1M tons / year of carbon savings.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to research a new type of electric motor with a high rotor pole switched reluctance (HRSRM) design. This HRSRM motor has a simplified physical construction with no permanent magnets but complex electronics that manage the torque and speed in the motor through carefully timed generation of magnetic fields. This class of motors have proven extremely difficult to research because of highly nonlinear response characteristics, and sensitivity to very small changes in timing, electromagnetics, and physical setup. This project will research methods for adapting dynamic control algorithms to increase the speed and sensitivity of the power electronics to manage these characteristics. Research will also examine physical elements of the design and build a generalized simulation model combining both finite element analysis as well as structural modeling, constrained mode analysis and vibration models to reduce and optimize noise, vibration and harshness measures. Finally this project will optimize the ~600 key parameters associated with an HRSRM motor, allowing the rapid design and prototyping of new motor designs in minutes rather than months.

    Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a novel, intraoperative imaging
    technology to address the problem of inadvertent cuts to vasculature during minimally
    invasive surgeries. More than 17% of patients who undergo these types of in-patient
    surgeries suffer from an intraoperative bleeding event. When a vessel is injured,
    there is a higher probability of hospital borne infection due to the loss of blood,
    and the added cost of care per patient increases by thousands of dollars due to
    corrective action and extended length of stay for the patient. The risk of vascular
    injury is compounded by risk factors, such as obesity, which limit the surgeon's
    ability to visualize and navigate vasculature. Therefore, there is a critical
    need to identify and assess hidden vasculature in real time. The proposed technology
    helps identify blood vessel before a cut is made. Importantly, this system will
    be designed for seamless integration into a suite of surgical instruments for
    multiple applications. Long term, the company will provide surgeons with the preeminent
    imaging platform to view, assess, and characterize a range of vessels (i.e. arteries/veins,
    ureters and bile ducts) in real-time for improved surgical guidance and outcomes.
    \n\nThe proposed project will develop a novel blood vessel detection and visualization
    platform using low-cost optical imaging sensors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    The proposed technology will provide visual and quantitative information about
    vessel presence and size in real-time that can supplement a surgeon's technique.
    This system will be simple, cost-effective, easy to employ, and highly accurate.
    Traditionally, the avoidance of blood vessels during minimally invasive surgery
    is accomplished by visualization or costly intraoperative imaging. The proposed
    technology will use pulsatile light absorption characteristics of blood vessels
    to provide quantitative information about vessel presence and size in real-time,
    supplementing a surgeon's technique. This project will also add significant value
    to the body of research conducted in the areas of signal processing and image
    analysis. In addition, the proposed technology will remove the risk of data loss
    due to artifacts in general and motion artifacts in particular. The proposed technology
    will be validated ex vivo and in vivo using a porcine animal model."

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project has the objective of demonstrating that discrete, belt mounted internet-connected wearable devices used by industrial workers can detect high risk lifting activities, promote safe lifting practices and behavior change, and predict the risk of musculoskeletal injuries due to unsafe lifting. Each year over 600,000 workers suffer a musculoskeletal injury due to lifting related activities, which cost US companies over $15bn annually. Worker injuries affect employee morale, absenteeism, productivity loss and employee turnover, all of which are challenges to the efficient running of a company and are a unnecessary cause of human suffering. By developing a wearable device that can detect high risk lifting activity and provide immediate feedback to workers, safer lifting practices can be promoted and a reduction in the number of unsafe lifts registered, leading to a reduction in injuries.

    The project includes three main technical objectives: i) the development of machine learning algorithms to detect lifting events from sensor data, and to measure risk related metrics associated to those lifting events. When a lift is considered high risk, real-time feedback will be provided to the worker; ii) the deployment of the device in an industrial setting at several customer sites for 12 months, with the number of high risk lifts performed by workers quantified over time to measure the ability of the system to drive behavior change in the workforce; and ii) the development of a model that can predict the likelihood of musculoskeletal injures based on the risk metrics measured. It is expected that the outcomes of the project demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of suffering musculoskeletal injuries, paving the way for a clear return on investment value proposition for the industrial companies and their insurance carriers who are potential customers.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the effort to bring our biomimetic rotor
    design to the marine hydrokinetic (MHK) market. MHK energy is a socially and environmentally
    friendly alternative to hydroelectric power, which harnesses energy from rivers,
    tides, ocean currents and manmade waterways without the use of a dam. This market
    is potentially large but still nascent due to high technology costs, concerns
    over turbine survivability, fish friendliness, and difficulty in permitting deployments.
    Our rotor's small, flexible configuration is a unique approach that addresses
    many MHK challenges with the mission of reaching the largest set of individuals
    underserved by current energy technologies. Our rotor seeks to displace diesel
    generation and complement intermittent renewable energy sources by providing an
    affordable, baseload clean energy solution for any individual or community; with
    the objective of scaling up to larger deployments by leveraging the scalable rotor
    design. This R&D Project will expand the body of knowledge for the rapidly emerging
    field of biomimicry by developing a flexible micro-hydro solution that enables
    energy generation from flowing water by allowing fluids to move over the surfaces
    of the rotor in their naturally preferred way. \n\n\n\nThis project will transform
    our promising proprietary rotor design into an optimized MHK turbine to be incorporated
    as the key component of a flexible micro-hydro system that addresses many of the
    challenges faced by the MHK market. The rotor is based on biomimicry and was designed
    using streamlines found in moving bodies of water with a deep profile to maximize
    the power transfer from low speed flows. The logarithmic design with receding
    edges results in a turbine that avoids damaging impacts with debris and marine
    life. The design is stable in variable flow conditions, which allows for a flexible
    power takeoff configuration with both the generator and power electronics housed
    above the water for improved affordability. During the project, computational
    fluid dynamic modeling will be used to simulate design changes and drive performance
    improvements. The most promising designs will be prototyped and integrated with
    multiple generator and tether combinations to determine the most efficient flexible
    power takeoff system. Conversion to power output for 12V battery charging will
    also be tested and optimized resulting in a complete power conversion chain. The
    performance of the rotor and system will be characterized by full scale testing
    locally and with The University of Washington."

    on developing compact camera modules with lower noise and improved contrast using
    a submicron pixel imaging sensor array. The commercial potential of this project
    centers on developing compact cameras for endoscopes, navigational and robotic
    surgical systems and more. Embedding these cameras in endoscope systems, and even
    the surgical tools themselves, permits new treatments across a broad range of
    medical specialties that otherwise are not possible. Switching to the minimally
    invasive forms of some common surgeries could save an estimated $14 billion in
    healthcare spending. Oncology, urology, gastroenterology, women's health and pediatric
    medicine are just some of the specialties that will significantly benefit from
    these ultra-compact cameras. A broader impact will ultimately come from utilizing
    submicron pixels in unique ways in high density arrays. The sensor?s small size
    and fast response times offer unique opportunities for spatial and temporal oversampling.
    The resulting large numbers of pixels can be employed in a compact multi-aperture
    arrangement to deliver significantly enhanced color mapping over traditional semiconductor
    imaging arrays, multispectral imaging, 3-dimensional image reconstruction, motion
    free auto-focusing, or some combination of the above, providing unique applications
    in medical imaging, defense, robotics, and consumer electronics.  \n\nThe miniaturization
    of camera systems calls for the continuous shrinking of pixel sizes. At a certain
    point, however, the maximum photo-electrons a pixel can hold becomes limited,
    yielding low signal-to-noise ratios and poor dynamic range. This project develops
    a novel optical sensor that maintains sensitivity down to hundreds of nanometers.
    As the size of this sensor decreases, the maximum measurable light intensity can
    remain constant and the signal-to-noise increases, bringing significant improvements
    to images? dynamic range and color/feature rendition. This result stands in stark
    contrast to the behavior of conventional pixels where maximum intensity threshold
    scales down with pixel size and noise increases with decreasing pixel size. Reducing
    these image sensors to practice requires transitioning from gallium arsenide based
    devices to silicon.  The work focuses on 1) finalizing design parameters, fabrication,
    and characterization of the electrical properties and optical response of the
    system and 2) fabrication and characterization of a linear photodetector array
    for the creation of both linear images and 2-D images assembled from linear images
    to characterize the noise, contrast and other image quality parameters of the
    prototype."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in its ability to improve healthcare in fundamental ways, such as (1) low volume draws that will enable diagnostics in low-resource settings like drug stores, at home, or in developing countries, (2) higher quality small-volume samples to make Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics more competitive with lab tests, enabling faster results in critical care/outpatient environments, and (3) low draw volumes, coupled with small volume diagnostic tests, that will enable improved care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired anemia, including neonates and patients with bone marrow damage caused by cancers or suppressed bone marrow due to cancer drugs. Our technology will enable medical testing from a small amount of blood, which could significantly impact global neonatal and pediatric healthcare, particularly in developing countries, and expand the market for blood containers.


    This project aims to design a microliter-scale blood container that offers the same analytic stability and consistency as blood samples obtained by larger volume tubes.  Critical to specimen stability is the ability to rapidly and uniformly distribute an anticoagulant in a blood specimen.  In larger containers, mixing is achieved by shaking a collection tube, creating turbulent flow wherein eddies and vortices mix the blood with the stabilizing reagent.  In low volume containers, fluid flow is laminar and shaking does not produce mixing.  Typical low volume containers rely on diffusion driven mixing.  This process is slow, and frequently results in the formation of micro-clots prior to complete specimen stabilization.  We will use our proprietary actuated, surface-attached posts (ASAP) to rapidly and thoroughly distribute anticoagulant in blood, increasing the accuracy and the reproducibility of results obtained from small volume draws.  This project will begin with an assessment of the biocompatibility of materials and specimen processing procedures.  We will test a number of ASAP configurations in order to minimize the time required for specimen stabilization.  The project will culminate with the production of a fully functional prototype that will be validated via comparison against blood stabilized in a larger volume specimen tube.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing manufactured concrete blocks that can be used to build arches, including roofs.  This feature has never been done with manufactured concrete block, and holds the potential to greatly expand the uses, benefits and capabilities of concrete block to an entirely new market segment.  The structures expected to be made possible with this novel masonry system include inexpensive, high-performance, energy efficient buildings with increased fire safety ratings, resistance to termites, increased safety for tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis and other sever weather events, and greatly increased building life cycle time. This technology could have a large positive economic impact on masonry construction and on the concrete block manufacturing industry in particular, both across the US and around the globe.  This work is expected to provide a greater understanding of the anisotropic strength of manufactured concrete block, and how this anisotropic strength is to be maximized within a given structure; this scientific understanding is expected to benefit the catenary thrust-line analysis of masonry arches.  This technology is expected to make superior construction available to homeowners, businesses, government buildings and public works (including bridges) at greatly reduced cost.


    This project will create a design for a building which will utilize as many of the common features made available by this masonry system which the average user (homeowner, building owner, business, government agency, etc.) is expected to want to use.  This building will be designed as a planetarium for Alfred University's Stull Observatory, and will include a twenty-four foot diameter planetarium room, as a domed hemisphere, made as a third frequency truncated icosahedron.  This building will also include a separate meeting room and a separate office.  This building will include Gothic windows, arched roofs, and flying buttresses which will create an outdoor porch which rings the outside of this building.  This building will be designed with a Professional Engineer and a Registered Design Professional (architect) to show all the equations, stress analyses, free body diagrams, etc., which were used to arrive at the final design.  Once completed, this building will serve as a test or sample building used to obtain an Evaluation Report by the International Code Council - Evaluation Services (ICC-ES).  A positive Evaluation Report from ICC-ES will allow this technology to be sold globally in accordance with the International Building Code (IBC).

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to improve the quality of care for anterior ocular wounds. To accomplish this, the project is focused on the development of a novel, hand-held, point-of-care device that can be used to evaluate the ocular surface in post-trauma or post-surgical patients. The device should be able to provide an accurate, objective measurement of a tear film biomarker that can be used by medical professionals to identify dangerous fluid leaks in the front of the eye which can save vision. Currently, this evaluation is only performed by trained eye doctors and requires positioning the patient at an expensive, immobile machine called a slit lamp to evaluate their eye. This cannot be done on patients who are unconscious or uncooperative and availability of this machine is limited. The lack of adequate tools for evaluation results in limited access to care, costly hospital transfers and missed diagnosis of wound leaks which can cause severe ocular infections and permanent vision loss. Successful commercialization of this product is expected to improve the accuracy of ocular examinations in 3.8 million Americans annually and may introduce a new frontier of tear film testing.


    The proposed project is focused on developing the device for direct use for patient care. The technological aim of the research is on the creation of a sophisticated biosensor that can accurately and noninvasively evaluate the tear film concentration of a specific biomarker. This work is expected to include the development of the electrical circuitry, the chemical composition and the channels for connection to the base unit. The plan is to also design the model for the handheld device. In order to make the device safe for patient use, the device can then be tested for its shelf-life stability and develop the proper sterilization. The next steps of testing can include clinical patients to evaluate the ability of the device to record the findings from the tear film. This information can then be used to refine the exact testing parameters for the device. The anticipated result of this research is a final prototype of the device that can be used for regulatory approval and clinical trials. The goal of the project is to transform the current standard of care for eye professionals and enable physicians to have an objective measure that can warn them about possible wound leaks and potentially save vision.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is in the improvement of atmospheric state observations from various platforms. This compact, integrated and ?plug and play? receiver design will make the existing observations more available, more economical, and will also enable previously unattainable observations of water vapor distributions within the atmosphere. This environmental sensor?s small size and low power requirements enables its deployment on various airborne, spaceborne or ground-based platforms, such as unmanned aerial aircraft, nanosatellites, ocean buoys, and remotely located ground-based instruments. One promising commercial application is private weather observing satellite constellations. It has been estimated that around 400 remote sensing nano/microsatellites will be launched worldwide between the years of 2016-2018. Water vapor and cloud observations are among the most important observations promising further understanding of weather events and to better synoptic or mesoscale forecasts. Improved atmospheric observations are directly related to increasingly accurate and useful weather forecasts. The benefits are expected to extend widely across the economy. Meteorologists point to more accurate and rapidly refreshed atmospheric observations as one of the necessities for the continuous improvements in weather forecasting, understanding of the atmospheric physics and climate.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will complete the design and build a fully functional prototype of a very compact, direct detection radiometer receiver, operating in the vicinity of the 183 GHz water vapor absorption line. All the receiver components will be designed and evaluated, including a noise source, detectors, filters, Monolithic Microwave Integrated circuits and others, first as individual parts and then within the assembly. A novel receiver architecture and integration of all components into one assembly allow for a drastic reduction in the receiver size and reduction of its power consumption, while improving its observational capabilities and stability. There are several aspects of the proposed effort that are unique and would provide profound advances in ultra-compact microwave radiometry. The receiver is expected to consume less than 0.5 Watt of power and weigh around 100 grams, with a continuous two-point calibration capability at its input.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to overcome limitations that prevent effective treatment of wound infections. There is a large potential market for this product as the U.S. spends over $50 billion per year on wound care and current wound care products have a high risk of rejection, scarring, and antibiotic resistance. The proposed novel wound care product will reduce the costs to treat infected wounds and limit the number of medical procedures required to restore tissue function. The product consists of a patented human extracellular matrix (hECM) coupled to a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP). The main innovation of the proposed product, compared to current treatments, is that it is designed to be toxic to infective bacteria and other pathogens, without harming human tissue. The hECM has regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity to enhance wound healing and improve treatment outcomes. In addition to creating a transformative product in a global market, achievement of AMP extracellular matrix tethering will lead to a broader understanding of AMP activity and unlock their commercial utility. The product can be used as a temporary wound dressing, a tissue restoring implant, or an implant coating.


    The proposed project will utilize a patented recombinant protein with an antimicrobial peptide, combined with a human extracellular matrix (hECM) material. The patented antimicrobial protein (AMP) is designed to bind collagen in the hECM. The combination of hECM and AMP will result in an antimicrobial regenerative matrix that will reduce the incidence of infection and improve wound healing. The objectives of the project are to scale-up hECM and AMP manufacturing processes, establish methods for assessing product characteristics and performance for manufacturing quality assurance and release criteria, and evaluate the shelf-life and in vivo performance of the scaled-up manufactured AMP-hECM product in a clinically relevant infectious wound healing model.  The AMP-hECM will be evaluated using biochemical, antimicrobial, mechanical and cell growth performance assays.  Scale-up of the bioengineered AMP and hECM will be achieved by optimizing the in vitro manufacturing bioreactor growth parameters and processing methods to improve overall product yield.  The anticipated outcome of the project is to have defined the large-scale manufacturing protocols and release criteria for the AMP-hECM product. This milestone will enable the execution of validation production runs, and advance the regulatory and commercialization pathways for the product.

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.

    The intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a hormone-free treatment alternative for women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the vaginal tissue is thin, dry, and inelastic. Women with vaginal atrophy experience day-to-day vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. This SBIR project catalyzes the development of a technology platform that will enable a novel home-use, hormone-free medical device to treat vaginal atrophy. This project represents a medical device treatment for vaginal atrophy developed specifically for women wishing to avoid hormone-based therapies. Currently available treatment options fall in two categories: over-the-counter products and hormone-replacement therapies. Over-the-counter products, like lubricants, are available at drugstores, but these products are often limited in their efficacy relative to the severity of symptoms many women experience. Hormone-replacement therapies on the other hand, such as estrogen creams, can be effective for women; however they are contraindicated for large market segments of women (e.g. breast cancer survivors and women with cardiovascular risk factors). Therefore, this SBIR project is critical to the development of a safe treatment alternative for women and represents a chance to significantly improve their quality of life.

    The proposed project supports the technical work required to develop this medical device treatment and addresses a major unmet need for breast cancer survivors and post-menopausal women. The work supported by this SBIR grant will complete necessary device improvements and prepare the technology platform for commercialization. The main objectives of this project are to 1) optimize the device for safety and usability, 2) execute specific design enhancements to ensure cost-effective manufacturability, and 3) complete all necessary quality system testing to meet FDA (Food and Drug Administration) requirements. To achieve the first objective, the company will complete all prescribed activities under the company's quality management system. User interviews will also be completed with device prototypes to explore features that enable and encourage appropriate device use. This work will be completed in cooperation between the company's engineering team and an outside industrial design firm. The second objective will require design for manufacturing activities, which will also be completed in a partnership with an outside firm. The third objective will be executed again by following the company's quality management system policies, processes, and procedures. All of these activities, once complete, will ensure the company's device is ready for commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the result of introducing a new generation of low-power wireless sensors for detecting Acoustic Emission events and detecting fatigue damage in structures. According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US transportation infrastructure has 605,102 operational bridges, of which 66,561 are structurally deficient. In particular, the fatigue damage monitoring technology of the project will initially target the more than 18,000 US highway bridges that are categorized as ?fracture critical? by the Federal Highway Administration. The technique?s ultra-low energy consumption will enable its use in low-power wireless sensors and make it an ideal response to this challenging problem. The anticipated benefits and commercial applications of this project are (1) a low-cost, easy-to-use mechanism for effective monitoring, allowing for early detection and timely repair of fracture and fatigue damage in infrastructure systems such as highway bridges; (2) improved public safety, with reduced maintenance costs and extension of the service life of critical and high-valued infrastructure systems; and (3) additional commercial applications in monitoring the structural health and integrity of other structures, including aircraft, oil and gas pipelines, machinery, cargo cranes, ships, etc.

    Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project addresses distributed structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure systems, particularly highway bridges. Because the creation of fatigue cracks in a structure is accompanied by the propagation of acoustic emission (AE) waves, wireless AE sensors can be used to detect such cracks. However, a challenge of AE detection sensors is high energy consumption, significantly more than the energy available in a battery-operated wireless device. As a result, conventional AE detection methods cannot be used with low-power wireless sensors. This project uses a novel and ultra-low power technique for long term monitoring of strain.  Then, AE monitoring is activated only if history of tensile strain in the structure under monitoring suggests likelihood of fatigue damage. In addition, using history and pattern of AE events, the method estimates the severity of fatigue damage in a material. Moreover, the method uses a variety of techniques to eliminate the effects of mechanical noise on AE measurements and achieve a high reliability in fatigue damage assessment. After development, the method is planned to be evaluated on highway bridges, airframes, and pipelines.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research, Phase II project is to help make therapy more consistent with patient preferences, beliefs, and values to maximize engagement in therapy and improve patient outcomes. Therapy for mental health problems is highly effective, yet many patients drop out before getting the full benefit because they are not satisfied or engaged in the therapy. The proposed project involves collecting data on all of patients actions in the online treatment system along with their ratings of each activity and their symptom improvement over time. The research and development team will use this data to create a machine learning system that will make suggestions for best next steps in therapy based on what thousands of other users experienced. This is the intelligent counseling system. It will work very similarly to movie streaming services or online book sellers who recommend movies or books to you based on your past preferences and the preferences of thousands of other users.

    The proposed project will develop a feedback and recommendation system based on advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to provide personalized treatments to customize and individualize online mental health treatment, the Intelligent Counseling System (ICS). This personalized system will contain a number of alternative treatment items from several theoretical perspectives, using a variety of patient interactive activities, varying in format, length, pace, and other characteristics. In such a setting, a recommendation system can predict the users' preferences and recommend the subsequent treatment component. In addition, to achieve maximum adherence and to decrease the attrition rate, the platform will enable personalized motivational interventions and supportive messaging. The delivery times and the content of supportive messaging will adapt and vary depending on the projected treatment progress. Our machine learning based system will be trained incrementally as more data becomes available over time, thus it will benefit from improved accuracy over time. We will extract local, semi-local, and global temporal features at multiple temporal resolutions and will use feature selection techniques to identify which factors contribute to the success of treatments for patients, and to predict if a user is improving or is deteriorating. This will result in adaptive motivational messages and recommendation for tailoring treatment in term of important identified treatment features.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project intends
    to meet the need for low cost dose-on-demand production of Carbon-11 isotope for
    biomarker and radiotracer applications in nuclear medicine.  Biomarkers and radiotracers
    are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT)
    metabolic imaging, in support of research, drug discovery, and detection of cancer
    and other illnesses.  They are also used for therapy staging of cancer, to determine
    if treatment is effective.  Common examples include myocardial perfusion imaging
    of the heart to visualize blood flow and function, PET scanning of the brain to
    detect early onset Alzheimer's and brain tumors, and Choline PET/CT for the diagnosis
    and staging of prostate cancer. Carbon-11 is an important radiotracer/radiopharmaceutical
    that offers unique advantages due to its ability to be easily incorporated into
    many molecules without impacting biological activity.  Carbon-11 is currently
    produced by using specialized targets on high-energy commercial cyclotrons.  These
    cyclotrons cost millions of dollars to install, and existing targets are inefficient.
    \ Low energy cyclotrons are significantly less expensive, and are currently under
    development by multiple commercial companies.  This project seeks to develop a
    novel cyclotron target methodology for producing Carbon-11 at low energies using
    unique nanomaterials, resulting in significantly lower costs.  \n\nThe intellectual
    merit of this project is in the use of novel nanomaterials to produce Carbon-11
    more efficiently and at lower cost, through development of recoil escape targets.
    \ It is challenging to find a good target material suitable for both efficient
    production of Carbon-11, by one of several available nuclear reactions, and efficient
    recovery of the produced radiotracer in a usable form.  The produced Carbon-11
    can be difficult to recover, as it is easily trapped in many conventional target
    materials, resulting in low yields.  Recent advances in nanoscience and technology
    allow for production of novel materials with unique characteristics.  Boron nitride
    nanotubes (BNNT) are composed of fibers with single atomic thickness, or at most
    a few atoms thick, allowing Carbon-11 to be efficiently produced and recovered
    in the form of carbon dioxide gas using low energy cyclotrons.  Prototype production
    targets will be developed and tested at commercial cyclotron sites.  The process
    for collecting the produced Carbon-11 gas will be optimized to achieve the highest
    yields of usable radiotracer material.  Efforts will be made to further develop
    BNNT materials with ideal characteristics, including high purity and optimal density."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is very significant. Suboptimal operational decision-making in emergency departments and hospitals leads to inefficiencies that result in excessive patient wait-times, the diversion of ambulances to other emergency departments, wasted resources and patients who either leave before being treated or against medical advice. By connecting modern analytical approaches, including statistical modeling and systems engineering methods, to real-time data routinely collected by hospitals, the proposed project promises to result in a tremendously valuable analytics platform that will assist administrators in making dozens of operational and staffing decisions each day. This informed decision-making will not only improve hospital efficiency, it will lead to both healthier and more satisfied patients and simultaneous dramatic increases in revenue and profit. The technology proposed will have the potential to add significant value to the approximately 5,000 hospitals in the U.S., often on the order of millions of dollars annually. Hospitals and health systems now realize the value of effective analytics, and the analytics platform proposed here will be an obvious investment for any emergency department or hospital whose goal is to provide the best care to its patients at lower costs.

    The proposed project promises to yield a set of decision-support applications upon which emergency departments and hospitals will base their decisions each day. Substantial investments by hospitals and health systems on information technology, and in particular, electronic health records, have set the stage for evidence-based, data-driven decisions. These decisions will effectively leverage real-time data along with analytical methods such as statistical forecasting and event-simulation modeling. In particular, this proposed project will develop software applications, based on these analytical methods and linking to real-time data sources, tailored to emergency departments and hospitals. This project will involve 1) addressing the real-time needs of hospital operational decision-makers, 2) further developing a statistical and simulation modeling platform to inform these real-time needs, specifically reflecting emergency departments and whole hospitals, and 3) ultimately ensuring that actionable insights are delivered in a timely and intuitive manner to key stakeholders. These actionable insights that derive from the data and sophisticated methods must be delivered to the right decision-maker at the right time and in the right format, but will then have the capacity to substantially improve both the quality and efficiency of care-delivery throughout the hospital.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is the reduction of deaths and long-term disabilities in people suffering from bleeding in the brain caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or traumatic brain injury. Currently, physicians detect worsening bleeding through a clinical exam where a patient shows outward signs of deterioration in their neurological status. By the time these signs of additional bleeding appear, much of the damage to the brain has already occurred. About a third of people who suffer a severe traumatic brain injury either die or are left disabled. For hemorrhagic stroke, 60% die and 70% of survivors are left with significant disabilities. A device which transmits and receives very low power radiofrequency signals has been created that can be put on a patients head. The presence of blood outside of the brain's vessels and arteries creates a characteristic change in the radio signal used by the device. Using radio waves to non-invasively detect brain bleeds will allow treatment to start sooner, which will save lives, reduce disabilities and lower the cost of treating severe brain injuries.

    The proposed project tests (i) the ability of the device to detect and characterize small changes in ICH size and location over time and (ii) the ability to display changes in the bleed in a meaningful way to physicians. An algorithm for determining the size and location of the hemorrhage will be tested using both a phantom model that mimics the human brain and an IACUC-approved pig ICH model. Multiple hemorrhage volumes and locations will be used to test the algorithm's ability to detect hemorrhage volume changes within 1 mL, location within 1 cm, and distinguish changes due to the hemorrhage from physiological changes in a living pig's brain. Signal measurements taken before, during, and after infusion of blood will be captured at each time point to test the accuracy of the algorithm. Software will be developed to display the information from the algorithm in three-dimensions while giving doctors and nurses control over thresholds for triggering an alarm and how often the device scans. To test the software, the data collected during the pig experiments will be used to determine how accurate the display matches the location and size of the hemorrhage from CT images collected during testing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create a suite of consumer hardware and software products that provide realistic tactile feedback to users who are touching objects in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). As evidenced by the current proliferation of low-cost head-mounted displays and motion tracking systems, three-dimensional interaction technologies are revolutionizing how people interact with computers, media, and each other. Since they are currently limited to vision and audio, endowing consumer-level human-computer interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly increase user immersion, making games more fun, online interactions more effective, and tools more efficient. Consequently, this project has the potential to expand the commercial reach of the burgeoning VR/AR market, opening up myriad opportunities for companies particularly in the gaming, entertainment, and e-commerce sectors. The innovation of this project also promises to enhance scientific and technological understanding of haptic human-computer interaction by establishing a new paradigm that blends minimal wearable hardware with sophisticated software algorithms. Finally, commercializing novel interactive technology also has the potential to help inspire a diverse array of young people to pursue a career in the critical areas of science, technology, engineering, and math.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project aims to advance knowledge of low-cost technology that can provide realistic tactile feedback to a user touching objects in VR or AR: the project?s intellectual merits center on testing a new approach that combines minimal haptic hardware and sophisticated software algorithms. The research objective is to create a fully functional industrial prototype of a wearable fingertip thimble and custom software that embody the proposed approach. When the user's finger moves to touch a virtual object, a platform inside the thimble will initiate contact with the fingerpad and press with a force that varies with penetration distance, to render surface softness. A thermal actuator will convey the object?s thermal conductivity and temperature. When the finger slides along a virtual object, the user will feel its texture via carefully designed platform vibrations. Specific research tasks to be addressed include exploring haptic actuator options, building a library of haptic object properties (HOPs) that can be applied to virtual objects, and creating a communication protocol for exchanging haptic signals among devices. This project is expected to yield a fully functional industrial prototype and developer kits for the wearable fingertip thimble.

    in design courses and contributes to the training of a strong workforce in areas
    related to science, technology and engineering. The Ecosystem is a software tool
    that automatically verifies designs against the requirements, to uncover oversights
    early in the process, but also fosters engineering judgement and creativity, allows
    for assessment of designs with less subjectivity, and facilitates smooth communication
    among team members. This results in productivity enhancements, higher quality
    designs and shorter time-to-market, but also in societal benefits (safer products,
    less risk of catastrophic accidents and more competitive design organizations).
    The target market consists of (1) educational institutions teaching engineering
    design, and (2) design companies striving to ensure compliance with the design
    specifications.  The core innovation is three-fold.  First, it consists of an
    e-design assessment engine that is being developed to a high degree of sophistication.
    \ Second, design repositories are investigated and developed for integration.
    \ Third, holistic (big data) analysis of design content and metadata is implemented.
    \n\nThe project seeks to develop an innovative design decision (learning) support
    system addressing problems related to the high cost of design oversights. Such
    oversights can result in catastrophic failures, product recalls, or simply in
    budget or schedule over-runs (due to rework).  The Ecosystem offers a flexible,
    yet systematic and generic, framework, for guiding designers through the design
    process, and for automatically assessing design activities, from each stage in
    the design process, against the product design specification (PDS). At the center
    of the Ecosystem is the e-design assessment engine, which decomposes the PDS,
    correlates the design activities against individual requirements, and provides
    real-time advisories in case of design oversights. The assessment engine automatically
    configures popular development tools for engineering design, determines relevant
    analyses, and interprets the outputs. The Ecosystem interfaces with these development
    tools, but does not replace. The Ecosystem can translate qualitative customer
    requirements into solid engineering requirements, and verify the relevance of
    the design content provided through seamless interfaces with industry databases.
    The Ecosystem improves designers' productivity through automation of many administrative
    tasks (e.g., generation of project reports). Despite the automation, the learning
    experience is not diminished. The Ecosystem prompts for, captures, and preserves
    the rationale for relevant engineering decisions. It also supports accredited,
    generic learning objectives for engineering design."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will revolutionize the treatment of individuals with autism. One of every sixty-eight US children has autism (over 1.1 million). The estimated cost of providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy to those who could benefit is $7.5 billion dollars annually. Societal impacts include: 1) more individuals with autism across the globe will receive treatment regimens that will enable them to live more fulfilled lives and reach their full potential; 2) families whose children are good candidates for treatment and receive it will experience reduced stress and better family life; and 3) the additional lifetime cost of not effectively treating children with autism, which is approximately ten-fold the cost of treatment, will be reduced. Because high-quality, contextually rich ABA performance data will be collected for the first time, efforts to apply data analytics will contribute in two important ways: a) patterns may be discerned across individuals with autism to better understand variations in autism and create therapies to target these differences; b) expansion of the frontiers of data mining to provide guidance in real time will contribute to a number of areas within and beyond ABA therapy.

    The proposed project will optimize therapy outcomes for individuals with autism by transforming agent-based guiding technology into an adaptive and intelligent ABA therapy assistant for supervisors and instructors. The project pushes the boundaries in providing cost-effective, adaptable, intelligent, real-time guidance and data-collection support to instructors that integrates naturally into the instructional process and is easy to learn and use. ABA therapy experts, supervisors and instructors will verify the analyses and resulting guidance incorporated into the technology.  Advanced theories of usability engineering, including some developed by the project team, will be used to build interfaces that supervisors and instructors can intuit without the need for learning new concepts and syntax. The project will utilize the collected logs from multiple sessions with multiple therapy recipients and multiple therapy providers to uncover hidden patterns and assist supervisors in selecting appropriate therapy steps personalized for the individual with autism. The project will build on a large body of recent work in visualization, machine learning on temporal predictive modeling and sequential pattern mining, including some of the previous results of the project team. Special attention will be paid to the recent work in educational data mining and intelligent tutoring.

Because the technology works on any mobile device and requires little instructor facilitation, it will be commercially successful in home settings when parents are busy and school settings where budget restrictions limit the number of facilitators. Beyond commercial impact, this project will help address the nation's need to prepare citizens for the 21st century economy, improve science literacy and help provide equal opportunities to underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This project is an effective teaching tool because it employs personalized learning, where the content and pace of learning are optimized for the individual learner. Personalized learning has already been shown to result in higher learner engagement and increased retention of concepts in educational software. Through the use of proprietary augmented reality and adaptive learning technology, this project brings personalized learning to hands-on STEM education, enabling learners to develop problem solving skills in a more effective, engaging and lower cost way.

    The key innovation in this project is a single software framework combining advanced augmented reality  (AR) and adaptive learning (AL) techniques to capture learners? interactions with real world objects (for example, circuit blocks, fraction bricks or chemistry models) via a mobile device camera, analyze the significance of the interactions and automatically provide personalized guidance to each learner.  The system will be the first to provide a high level API above the complexity of AR and AL, allowing designers of learning experience modules to focus solely on content and user experience instead of hundreds of thousands of lines of complex code associated with AR and AL. The methods employed will be the research, design and development of the augmented reality and adaptive learning engine, its integration with three learning experience modules: circuits, fractions, basic geometry, and an evaluation of the modules. To guide the development, pilot studies utilizing A/B testing with competing approaches, pre and post assessments, and behavioral analysis of users interacting with the system will be conducted periodically.

    the advancement of telerobotic control technology for subsea operations. As humans
    deploy and maintain ever more complex underwater hardware, conduct subsea scientific
    sampling and exploration and develop natural resources in hostile, deep and remote
    locations, the need for ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) is increasing. ROVs
    have transitioned from basic transport and inspection tools to mission critical
    machines for construction, maintenance and intervention. Despite advances in sensing
    and machinery, significant challenges persist which have plagued the industry
    with high costs and unacceptable downtime, as well as safety risks. Limited situational
    awareness, data deluge and inadequate manual operator controls combine to create
    high rates of equipment breakage, unpredictable and inefficient task completion
    and high mission overhead. This work is developing innovative products for 3-dimensional
    visual awareness and computer assisted control systems for subsea teleoperated
    robots. Divers can be replaced in hazardous situations by telerobots using this
    technology. The rate of untoward incidents and their severity will be reduced
    for a large range of subsea activities. Economic benefits include reduced costs,
    new employment opportunities, competitive advantages and contributions to the
    national technological infrastructure in subsea operations. \n\nThis Small Business
    Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will address fundamental challenges
    of connecting higher-dimensional data from remote environments to intuitive controls.
    Its intellectual merit is the refinement of a collaborative approach to command
    and control allowing ROV pilots to communicate seamlessly with each other and
    the robotic system. This will be done by developing several foundational innovations
    that, separately, enhance capabilities (and may become individual products), and
    that together derive immense value to the customer. These technologies are in
    the areas of: (1) Pilot Interface/Control room software; (2) Sensor fusion and
    processing; (3) Task assistance and workflow management; and (4) Manipulator and
    vehicle control. Successful implementation of visualization, sensor fusion, control
    methods, and haptic virtual fixtures serves as an excellent demonstration example
    of these technologies. With these technologies combined into a single software
    platform and integrated with a robotic system, increased performance, predictability,
    and safety can be achieved in a way that surpasses what is currently possible
    for purely automated or manual robotic systems. Although this work is focused
    on underwater operations, it can also be extended to terrestrial applications,
    such as industrial assembly, welding and machining, nuclear maintenance and robotic
    dredging and excavation."

    of high-speed\nwireless modems usable subsea and significant cost reduction of
    deep-water operations ?\nindustry experts estimate savings of nearly 20% of deep-water
    operations through the\navailability of subsea WiFi. Today, there is no broadband
    wireless communication available\nunderwater. In the deep ocean, remotely operated
    vehicles (ROVs) require a tether for\ncommunication and a support ship for tether
    management; sensors and systems must either be\nphysically connected, or retrieved
    from the deep sea to exchange data. An ROV support ship\ncosts about $120k/day
    leading to over $7B spent on ROV support ships in 2013. The proposed\nmegabit-per-second
    technology would allow ROV manufacturers and operators to cut the\ntether on many
    of their vehicles. Wireless ROVs can move unencumbered throughout coverage\narea,
    piloted from anywhere (e.g. from Houston), without expensive surface vessels.
    The\nproposed wireless modem technology connects ROVs and machinery to wired infrastructure,\nenabling
    safe operation of heavy subsea machinery without the possibility of cables or

    to develop a faster\nand more reliable wireless communication system for the sub-sea
    industry. Current state of the\nart communication links for the deep ocean are
    either tethered, requiring long, bulky, and\nexpensive cables to connect machinery
    and systems, or have extremely low data rates, enabling only \nthe most rudimentary

    WiFi-like data rates in the Mbps (megabits/sec) range ? 100 to 1,000 times\nfaster
    than existing underwater wireless communication technologies - and enable video\nstreaming
    and real-time control of subsea infrastructure, machinery, and mobile underwater\nvehicles.
    Since radio signals do not propagate far underwater, the proposed technology uses\nsound
    waves, as whales and dolphins do, for communication. The speed of sound is 200,000\ntimes
    slower than the speed of radio propagation, and mobile acoustic transmitters and\nreceivers
    hence suffer from severe Doppler distortion. The proposed technology dynamically\nmeasures,
    tracks, and compensates for this distortion, to enable wireless communication
    at\ndata rates never before possible underwater."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to provide a new tool revealing important information regarding skeletal muscle strength and health. Muscle weakness is a pervasive problem across our society, including people with joint disease, aging people, obese people, and people with neuromuscular disorders. All of these problems affect muscles across the body in different and non-intuitive ways; however, to date there has not been marketed technology that allows for quantitative measurement of muscle size on a muscle-by-muscle basis and specific analysis to address the muscle weakness problem. Due to the current high cost, the initial targeted customers will be elite athlete organizations, with the goal of using the technology to improve performance as well as to provide more quantitative metrics for predicting injury susceptibility and make return-to-sport decisions. However, with research and development to bring down the cost, the ultimate goal is to make a broadly used clinical tool for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions related to musculoskeletal disease and mobility, which will have broad societal impact.

    The proposed project will provide a major advancement in image-based modeling and data analysis tools in order to allow high-throughput imaging, rapid and accurate segmentation of muscles and efficient data analysis. Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to create a medical device capable of rapidly guiding treatment to stop bleeding in trauma patients. Trauma can affect the body's ability to form clots to stop bleeding. Of the more than 2 million severe cases of trauma in the U.S., approximately one third will develop a condition: trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), which increases mortality 4-fold. TIC can be corrected; however, current tests to identify TIC take too long to effectively guide treatment. This leads to sub-optimal care and increased mortality and morbidity. The current standard-of-care to correct TIC is the transfusion of blood products. A patient should only be transfused if necessary because unnecessary transfusions can lead to complications resulting in longer hospital stays and even death. A rapid assay that can evaluate a trauma patient's coagulation status can help guide treatment of their injuries, resulting in improved standard-of-care that can both save lives and healthcare dollars. Yearly trauma rates unfortunately remain stable, and with an addressable market of more than $400M per year in the U.S., the commercial impact for such an assay is significant.

    The proposed project is to develop a rapid assay that provides an individualized assessment of a trauma patient's coagulation status. A significant subset of trauma patients develop impairment to the normal coagulation process as a result of their injuries. Current assays to identify this impairment take too long to effectively guide treatment. Therefore, successful completion of this project will yield a disposable microfluidic card (microcard) that has multiple advantages over current assays, which are slow and non-specific. The microcard will measure clot characteristics currently used by emergency room physicians to guide treatment, but will do so in less than five minutes. This is a critical feature as it quickly guides treatment, meaning that there is time for re-evaluation to determine if treatment is effective. The microcard will also include on-board positive and negative controls that indicate a patient?s individual coagulation profile. This will result in personalized and more accurate treatments that can reduce complications and mortality. The rapid and specific microcard assay will significantly improve care of injured patients while conserving resources and time, ultimately saving money for the U.S. healthcare system.

    The broader impact/commercial impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in promoting the protection of human health, the environment, and our nation's natural resources by providing new sensors that enable fast, accurate, cost-effective sampling and analysis tools to monitor pollution and exposure. The innovations developed here will allow for the rapid identification and detection of hazardous compounds in water at substantially reduced cost. These technological innovations will translate into triple bottom-line savings of companies by enhancing our ability to protect people and the planet, while simultaneously providing cost and time savings to the business. The technology embodies the concepts of sustainability and ease of use, and will achieve broad commercial appeal by saving businesses money, time, and effort while also giving them more data on potential sources of pollution. Scientifically, this technology will enable more precise assessment of environmental pollution by providing more rapid measurement capability at a larger scale than is currently possible.


    This project will develop an innovative, market-disruptive technology for measuring toxic metals in water. This technology is inexpensive, portable, and does not require any power or external reading equipment. Furthermore, it can be adapted to a wide range of toxic compounds after initial commercialization around metals analysis. The system costs an order of magnitude less than the current "point of need" technologies capable of quantitative determination of toxic metals in water, and two orders of magnitude less than the traditional laboratory tests. Access Sensor Technologies is a new startup, but the core team has a strong track record in the field of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for environmental analysis where the proposed system represents a major innovation in the field. The proposal has four technical objectives: (1) Expand the palette of applicable chemistry to include additional metals: cadmium, lead, manganese, and both chromium 3+ and 6+; (2) Test the prototype system in a relevant laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment; (3) Achieve a successful customer-driven demonstration of the system in the field; and (4) Identify key elements of manufacturability that define the roadmap to production of the system at market scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a new standard of quantifying touch for industries currently relying on qualitative data from expert sensory panels (the tactile equivalent of professional wine tasters). Advancing the understanding of the role and function of tactile sensing in perception and manipulation is also essential if robots are to behave like humans. Studies have demonstrated that humans who cannot feel due to permanent disease or temporary anesthesia perform poorly in fine manipulation tasks (similar to even the best robotic systems without touch). The research proposed in this project is the next step to bring tactile sensing and sensory-motor intelligence to the next generation of robotics. The successful demonstration of a tactile sensor with perceptual similarity to the human fingertip would mark substantial progress in the field of telemanipulation, bringing the world one step closer to remote haptic perception.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to develop the world's first standard of human tactile perception. It has been proposed that tactile recognition presents a more difficult problem than vision and hearing, requiring not only intelligent sensory processing, but also intelligent algorithms to select and control movements, which have a tremendous influence on what is sensed. Artificial sensors that mimic the mechanical properties and sensitivity of the human fingertip have not existed until recently. The research proposed herein will test hypotheses that a biologically inspired robotic system can measure properties that correspond to subjective percepts, descriptors and associations that humans use to characterize objects by touch.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in the automated manufacture of lightweight high-strength carbon fiber composite materials. Experts agree that composite manufacturers must lead innovations in sustainability, price reduction, and cycle-time reduction to meet end-market needs. The innovations proposed in this project, coupled with Vistex Composites' cutting edge Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process, directly address these needs by significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in composites manufacturing equipment. The prevailing motivation for short automated cycles is posed by the automotive industry, where lightweighting delivers major benefits for fuel consumption but where current processes cannot affordably and quickly produce carbon fiber automotive parts in large numbers. The equipment innovations proposed will not only enhance the automotive market but will have substantial commercial value across all composite markets as they allow the manufacture of equivalent quality products, faster, with less waste, significant energy savings, and at lower cost. Furthermore, the proposed automated process will enable Vistex in its aggressive path towards not only broader adoption of its Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process technology but also broader adoption of composite materials. This will directly drive manufacturing job creation, for Vistex and its customers, as composites displace foreign produced goods.


    This project addresses the design, fabrication, and analysis of an automated composite manufacturing cell using Vistex's patented Specialized Elastomeric Tooling process as the central technology. The standard composite manufacturing process, the autoclave, has long cycle times (hours), requires significant manual labor, and is expensive. Vistex's proposed manufacturing cell addresses these concerns. In the proposal manufacturing cell will be designed and fabricated to make a composite product using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling but where parts (1) can be moved rapidly and accurately using automation, (2) rapidly cured using Specialized Elastomeric Tooling, and (3) rapidly ejected/removed from the tooling, all while creating an equivalent or superior product to with significant cycle time savings over the industry's standard autoclave process. Through the use of material testing, cost analysis, and other metrics, each stage of the proposed manufacturing cell will be benchmarked against industry standard processes. The anticipated result will be a prototype turnkey rapid automated manufacturing cell and commercially usable products for project partners.

- abstractText: "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims
    to answer the presidential call to \"create digital tutors that are as effective
    as personal tutors.\" More than any other subject, mathematical learning is cumulative,
    and as students fall behind their classmates, new material becomes less comprehensible
    and they can face an ever-widening gap to their peers. Formative assessment (FA)
    practices have been well established as effective in closing these gaps and informing
    teacher decision-making. While the influx of mobile computing devices has enormous
    potential to help facilitate change in education, the potential is heavily dependent
    on the availability of proven, research-backed software and services. This project
    will help close achievement gaps by providing students with adaptive, personalized
    instruction and also providing teachers with valuable FA techniques, data, and
    suggestions. More broadly, the data will yield opportunities to research and model
    student understanding and to analyze the learning process, enabling additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    With its strong customer value propositions and innovations that will enable new
    forms of software-enhanced teaching and learning, this project will also create
    significant commercial value within the educational market. \n\nThis project will
    create digital learning environments that go beyond current state-of-the-art systems
    to deliver adaptively selected instructional video segments and highly interactive
    problems, and do so while maintaining a flow of content that feels natural - as
    if the learning was occurring in the presence of an actual tutor. The ability
    of the system to adapt to the needs of an individual student is based upon a real-time
    assessment of student understanding and leverages cutting edge research from the
    fields of formative assessment, machine learning, artificial intelligence and
    big data. The ability to model student understanding and analyze the learning
    process will lead to the creation of new learning analytics tools and enable additional
    research into effective practices for the teaching and learning of mathematics.
    The proposed research will seek to demonstrate, in a randomized crossover trial,
    the effectiveness of the adaptive, online system over a control treatment. The
    researched solutions will also employ novel FA implementations such as collaborative
    review and white-boarding (via wireless communication), record and playback of
    teacher work, use of student sentiment, groupings of peers for collaborative work,
    and models of student understanding that incorporate teacher input (teacher plus
    software in the FA loop)."

    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a system to dramatically simplify how course content is shared, discovered, curated and managed in educational institutions. The vast majority of content in educational institutions is in multiple silo-ed repositories. Hence, compliance tracking, aligning curricula with competencies and course authoring are manual and expensive processes. This project aims to unlock these silos and make it simple to search, tag and curate courseware at topic-level across multiple platforms. The technology also extracts student feedback and assessment information and maps it against granular learning objectives to provide new insights to track and improve learning outcomes. By unlocking courseware stuck in silo-ed college systems, this project facilitates a cross-institutional marketplace that enables any institution to share and/or monetize curated high quality content, and conversely have access to curated course packs that may be taught by adjunct faculty, a $2B market opportunity. Simplifying faculty access to Open Educational Resources and curated learning content from other colleges will help drive down student course-pack costs significantly.

    The key technical innovation in this project is seamless extraction of learning content from multiple educational repositories coupled with a syllabus-driven semantically intelligent search and recommendation engine woven into the course curation process. Developing an abstracted mechanism to interface with different types of learning management systems and other repositories, and making it portable without requiring a common content format is a significant innovation. Natural Language Processing techniques combined with curated controlled vocabularies and taxonomies are applied to simplify curation of a course, notably automatic topic identification and instructional tagging. The curation data is leveraged in the semantic search engine to improve recommendation of courseware during course authoring. The goal of the adaptive recommendation engine is to improve discovery and usage of both open educational resources and courseware developed in other colleges, without requiring expensive professional services. Another goal of the project is to extract student feedback seamlessly using IMS defined standards regardless of which learning management system is used to deliver the content. The student feedback, assessment data, grades and other information pulled from various college systems are then correlated to provide rich analytics and visibility of student outcomes and alignment of courseware with competencies.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) Phase II project is multi-fold: First, the proposed tripolar concentric
    ring electrode and instrumentation for acquiring brain signals, tripolar electroencephalography
    (tEEG), is a platform technology that has a variety of medical and commercial
    applications. By providing significantly clearer brain signals, tEEG will resolve
    conventional EEG?s major drawback of poor signal quality that clinicians and researchers
    have been struggling with for decades. tEEG can advance diagnosis and fill unmet
    clinical and research needs such as detection of biomarkers to quantify various
    neurological disorders. Second, commercially, tEEG can transform the market landscape
    and set a new standard for EEG equipment. The fundamental improvement promised
    by tEEG and its non-invasive nature are particularly appealing. tEEG could greatly
    simplify and advance the diagnosis of a wide spectrum of neurological disorders
    (epilepsy, sleep disorders, stroke, Parkinson?s, Alzheimer?s, etc.) and more effectively
    guide neurosurgical and other medical procedures. Third, the fundamental improvement
    in spatial resolution and artifacts rejection in EEG signals will help advance
    the understanding of brain activity, leading to new discoveries in the research
    of various brain diseases and neurological disorders. \n\nThe proposed project
    aims to develop a portable tripolar concentric ring electrode (TCRE) electroencephalography
    (tEEG) recording system and perform a comprehensive clinical evaluation to demonstrate
    that tEEG can detect certain important brain EEG signals better than conventional
    EEG. EEG is the primary diagnostic tool for epilepsy, the most common serious
    brain disorder worldwide, but misdiagnosis occurs in up to 50% of the patients.
    Artifact contamination seriously hinders the effectiveness of EEG and is a root
    cause of misdiagnosis. tEEG automatically suppresses artifacts and increases the
    interpretability of EEG through two inventions: (1) a transformative electrode
    configuration - the TCRE; and (2) the proprietary tEEG Interface and digitizer.
    The TCRE, tEEG Interface, and digitizer together comprise a complete, Portable
    tEEG system with the data stored and displayed on a laptop. In this project, clinicians
    will evaluate tEEG against conventional EEG in areas such as usability, ability
    to suppress artifacts, and superiority in seizure detection. If successful, tEEG
    would generate intense interest in the field because of the significant clinical
    and research impact. We expect that comparing tEEG and EEG in a clinical setting
    will demonstrate the superiority of tEEG for diagnosing epilepsy."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is to make the 'green' solar industry truly green. As the deployment of solar modules expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that module wastes will appear in large quantities by early 2030's and by 2050 they will total 78 million tonnes. Today most module wastes end up in landfills. This SBIR project will develop a technology to maximize the revenue from module recycling. It has the potential to enable a profitable recycling business without any government subsidy. By recovering all the valuable components in modules, our technology has the potential to generate up to $60 billion in revenue from 78 million tonnes of modules.

    The proposed project develops sustainable recycling processes and related equipment for silicon solar cells and modules. The goal of the project is to separate and recover all the valuable, toxic, and bulky components in cells and modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, lead, copper, aluminum, tin, and glass. The target for solar-grade silicon recovery is 85% and the target for metal recovery, especially silver, is over 90%. The revenue from recycling, based on today's prices for solar-grade silicon and silver, is $15/module by our technology, as compared to $3.50/module by today's technology. The primary work of this project will be developing a prototype for silicon solar cell recycling and optimizing the process for a production environment. The target throughput of the prototype is up to 50 kg of solar cell wastes per day.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.

    This effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.

- abstractText: "This project creates an educational, touchscreen-based software that
    translates visual educational content into accessible, multisensory content for
    students with special needs, and particularly those with blindness and visual
    impairments. Consider the challenge in the educational landscape today: schools
    are increasingly adopting digital tools oriented toward creating a more interactive,
    personalized experience for mainstream students, but at the same time, are struggling
    to accommodate their diverse student population, particularly, the 6 million students
    in special education in the U.S. This problem is exaggerated in Science, Technology,
    Engineering, and Math (STEM), where content is often complex and visual. This
    project addresses these challenges, building on what we already know about human
    information processing and haptic interfaces to create software that will automatically
    convert highly visual content into content that can be seen, heard, and felt in
    real-time in class. This project supports NSF?s mission ensuring that inclusion
    of all students is at the forefront of the digital transformation of U.S. classrooms.
    The societal impacts of this work overcome several barriers impeding students
    with special needs from being independent and active contributors in the STEM
    educational experience and ultimately, many STEM professions. ViTAL projects a
    direct, financial return on investment for taxpayers within three years of operations,
    generating both revenue and new jobs, with plans to multiply this growth year
    over year. \n\n\nThe innovation in this project is the creation of methods and
    algorithms for effective translation of visual content into multimodal content,
    appropriately down sampled for the nonvisual sensory channels yet effective in
    conveying the most meaningful information. Such a conversion currently does not
    exist, which results in high overhead costs to create accessible graphics and
    is a major pain point in special education, particularly for individuals with
    visual impairments or blindness. Further, translating graphical content from the
    visual to the multimodal (visual, auditory, and haptic) space is not a straightforward
    conversion due to the limited bandwidth of human touch compared to vision and
    the complexity of features presented in graphical information. This challenge
    is exaggerated when accounting for the varying types of haptic feedback that can
    be provided from varying platforms (Android and iOS). This project addresses these
    challenges, creating a streamlined solution for generating accessible, multisensory
    content, in real-time, on commercial platforms for K-12 classrooms. The outcomes
    of this project will (1) create the algorithms needed to provide an automated
    conversion from the visual to multimodal space, (2) establish a teacher \"dashboard\"
    to streamline the proposed software?s integration in the classroom, and (3) expand
    the software to the iOS market while simultaneously uncovering novel haptic effects
    that leverage Apple?s unique Taptic feedback. Upon completion of the development,
    the software will be beta tested with partnering schools, and then released on
    both Android and iOS markets."

    This project will improve the awareness and perception of careers that require science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies. Advocacy is a critical component of career readiness, yet current advocates (parents, guardians, educators, or members of the community) are often not in the position to inform students of potential career options. Career and workforce readiness programs are resource constrained, don't meet the needs of differing learning styles, have inherent bias, and are largely focused on compliance over student competency building. Many underrepresented youths who would otherwise succeed in STEM are often deterred by a lack of role models. If youth understood the opportunities, they could pursue academic pathways to amass skills that better prepare them to enter the workforce. Furthermore, educators need professional learning experiences and access to insights about their students in order to improve STEM teaching and learning. Helping individuals select rewarding and suitable degrees, training, and careers will increase the likelihood of higher job retention. As more individuals are inspired to pursue and stay in STEM, taxpayers will benefit from increased innovation which in turn will provide tax dollars to invest in such things as healthcare, national security, education, or humanitarian assistance.

    The project will address technical challenges of amassing and distributing massive amounts of 3rd party STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) resource data (both structured and unstructured), developing an information management system for educators and families, developing adaptive learning skill modules, advancing a second generation smart recommendation engine based on big data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques, and performing database mining and creating data visualizations to derive meaningful workforce development insights. In addition, the project will involve controlled experiments and usability tests whereby a large amount of anonymized and aggregated student data and business/education entity feedback will be collected. The ultimate goals of the R&D and experiments are to validate that the resulting application, predictive models, information management practices, advocacy networks, and data visualizations have the desired outcome of boosting immediate and near-term student outcomes regarding STEM career intentions and actions.

    This project will address the need for accessible, creative music education. Over 90% of Americans believe music education is valuable, but very few people ever learn enough to create their own music. Instrument lessons are a great way for some beginners to learn about music; however, instrument lessons are expensive and difficult, and focus on performance and technique at the expense of creativity. This project uses a simple audiovisual composition interface to empower music learners to create their own original music on mobile devices from the very beginning of their music education. By combining this intuitive composition interface with data tracking and analysis, this project creates the opportunity to provide music makers with personalized, adaptive feedback as they compose. Currently, $3 billion are spent each year in the United States on instrument lessons, even though they are unaffordable for many potential customers. By leveraging the proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, this project will deliver an accessible, low-cost digital music education option, creating a new market that includes customers who are currently priced out. Expanding participation in creative music education will increase the quantity and quality of music composed worldwide, while also building a sustainable, revenue-generating business and creating new jobs.

    Through data-driven agile software development, this project will address the need for accessible music education through the creation of a technology platform that delivers adaptive learning to musical beginners. Because the platform upon which this project is built is already empowering the creation of thousands of songs each week and collecting usage data from live users, this project is uniquely positioned to tackle the complex problem of providing algorithmic feedback on creative work at scale. Research and development will proceed in four stages: (1) expanding internal tools to allow for direct analysis of the thousands of songs being created on the platform each week; (2) developing an algorithmic approach to analyzing songs and reporting the results to users; (3) applying analysis to match users with relevant communities and collaborators; and (4) implementing adaptive learning approaches to help users more effectively learn to create music. This staged development process will result in an innovative and highly differentiated technology that enables beginners with no musical experience to compose their own music, and uses data to actively support their individual needs as they learn.

    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to engineer microbes for the cost-effective production of specialty chemicals. Currently, engineered microbial strains bear mutations that increase the production of chemicals of interest by inhibiting the cell's ability to produce off pathway chemicals. These "loss-of-function" mutations are critical as they effectively channel the cell's metabolic flux toward the product of interest. This both boosts the production efficiency and eases downstream purification by eliminating the accumulation of undesirable but chemically-similar contaminants. Unfortunately, these mutations may also decrease the fitness of the cells and, as a result, the growth media must be supplemented with costly nutrients. Technical research herein will assess the feasibility of applying novel regulated proteolysis technology to simultaneously direct maximal metabolic flux toward the target chemical of interest while avoiding the need to supplement the growth media. If successful, this technology would provide a great cost savings and enable fermentative production to be applied more broadly in the production of specialty chemicals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide a stable and cost-effective fermentative production route to a specialty chemical.  Fermentative production of chemicals offers many advantages over traditional petrochemical or extraction-based production processes.  Petrochemical production maintains the nation?s reliance on an unsustainable feedstock (oil) and also leads to national security issues as the US is largely dependent on foreign oil sources.  Chemical production via extraction from plant materials also has ecological challenges.  The process often uses toxic solvents, and may rely on unsustainable farming practices for many plants that are not traditional food crops.  Engineered microbes fermented on sugar feedstock produced using high-efficiency agricultural practices offer a stable alternative for producing specialty chemicals, both in terms of supply and price.

    This project, from the University of Alabama (UA), extends their initial I-Corps Site award for scale up to their next phase of support for innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. This is a Type II I-Corps Site project. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have already received a Type I award.

    The goal of this I-Corps Type II Site is to build on, extend and expand the local innovation ecosystem, and to nurture STEM faculty and students to transition their ideas into the marketplace so these early stage teams can build sustainable companies, create new jobs, attract investment, and benefit society. Boosting the local innovation ecosystem by nurturing STEM faculty and students propelled the University of Alabama Site into a formal, active, local innovation ecosystem contributing to the national network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. The UA Site provides infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or become I-Corps Team applicants. In 2016 the US Site became partners with the  regional I-Corps Node, I-Corps South, at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The UA Site, which has been successful in activities that increase inclusiveness, will also continue to improve and expand Lean Launchpad curriculum and training programs.

    This project, from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP), establishes an NSF I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This project funds teams recruited from faculty research labs, student research projects and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Technology Transfer/Startup Programs to engage in entrepreneurial training and customer discovery with the aim of learning about and experiencing lean startup methods. The site is supported by a network of faculty and industry mentors who serve as advisors to teams. The goals of the CPP I-Corps Site are to prepare teams to qualify and succeed in the I-Corps National Program and to develop a local innovation ecosystem to bolster the national innovation ecosystems.

    This CPP Site provides opportunities for under-represented minority (URM) and low-income students to collaborate with faculty researchers and industry mentors to transition scientific discoveries and other Intellectual Property into the market place. CPP, is a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI). Successful implementation of the program could serve as a model for other institutions that serve large populations of URMs and students from low-income communities, including other HSIs and AANAPISIs. This project also has the potential to contribute to the economic development of the City of Pomona and the San Gabriel Valley Region in eastern Los Angeles County, an area significantly below state and national averages on major indices of economic development.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    This project, from The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc. (VentureWell), coordinates, convenes, and evaluates the National Innovation Network and its Innovation Corps (I-Corps) programs.

    Through this project, VentureWell connects national programs to form the "National Innovation Network" (NIN). This emerging community of innovators represents a key component of NSF's I-Corps programs. With the NIN, NSF accelerates the development of a national innovation ecosystem that reaches deeply and broadly across the country to engage the most creative and consequential research discoveries and talents in the process of entrepreneurship. The NIN is composed of clusters of universities that support the I-Corps  Nodes -- the primary training group for the I-Corps national course teams; the I-Corps Sites -- that include the individual institutions dedicated to spurring on very early stage teams; the Teams -- that focus on market validation of technology innovations; and organizational stakeholders such as mentors who support the teams, and venture development partners such as angel investors, venture capitalists and other types of investors.

    The role of VentureWell in the advancing of the NIN involves seven primary activities:
         1. Commission teaching teams for eleven NSF I-Corps National Team Trainings
         2. Implement I-Corps Faculty Training
         3. Convene an I-Corps Faculty Summit
         4. Design and implement Teaching Assistant Training
         5. Organize and implement the annual National Innovation Network conference that brings together all of the Nodes and Sites
         6. Prepare, disseminate and archive the curriculum and curate best practices for pedagogical improvements
         7. Conduct Ongoing Course Evaluation

    A particular focus of this project is VentureWell's research and assessment of formative and summative evaluation of I-Corps Team experiences in cohorts as well as related dissemination activity. The formative evaluation is designed to understand participants' satisfaction with the cohort and course and perspective on the course environment, to understand the quality of instruction, and to assess knowledge gains. The evaluation involves the administration, response rate monitoring, data collection, and cleaning of four surveys: (i) pre-course, (ii) after kickoff, (iii) after week-3 of course weekly webinars, and (iv) post-course. The summative evaluation is designed to track individual and team outcomes of interest to NSF and assess the impact of the course at approximately one year and 3.5 years after formal participation in the program ends. Finally, dissemination activities are designed to ensure that key program information is shared with appropriate audiences. In addition, VentureWell is creating public-use datasets. These datasets contain de-identified data from the pre-course, post-course and longitudinal outcomes surveys in order to disseminate information about the program to the I-Corps research community and allow others to use these data in their research.

    This project, from Binghamton University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site strengthens the ecosystem at Binghamton University. By integrating existing innovation support programs and technology transfer with entrepreneurship and business incubation services, technologies stemming from faculty research, student ingenuity, and community innovators are evaluated for commercial viability. Experienced technology transfer professionals, technical experts resident in Binghamton's industry-facing centers, and on-staff entrepreneurship and financial advisers recruit teams and promote promising teams into the program.

    Entrepreneurship and engineering faculty, entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs), and community coaches and mentors stimulate ideation and team building, and guide the innovators through theory and practice, and, ultimately, the go / no-go decision. By virtue of a rigorous selection process and hands-on training, the teams with customer-validated, technology- and manufacturing-feasible products and services proceed with commercialization with further support from the university, local businesses, and funders, as well as the I-Corps regional and national nodes. The process creates a growing cadre of entrepreneurs who continue to innovate, build businesses, mentor and invest in others, and overall recharge the entrepreneurial ecosystem, making Binghamton and the University a hub for entrepreneurs, investors, and start-up companies.

    The Binghamton I-Corps Site is meant to transform the mindset of University faculty, staff and students, as well as that of community members and leaders by providing a practical, achievable approach to generating new, sustainable ventures built around technologies. Demonstrating this path forward creates positive and powerful relationships between universities, the local business, professional services and investor communities, industry, and government. Generating trust and interactions between academia-private sector-government has ripple effects far beyond the teams going through the program, and propagate a self-sustaining, entrepreneurial ecosystem driven and replenished by new launches. Furthermore, by bringing together entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs, this Site program blurs lines separating big and small business, manufacturing and service industries, academia and the private sector, and spurs efforts towards the common goal of value and job creation through new ventures. Successful launches of companies inspire Binghamton University researchers, students and graduates, and instill optimism about the prospects for creating wealth and fulfilling jobs in Binghamton, or wherever their careers take them throughout the nation.

    also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National
    Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThis
    I-Corps Site is managed by the UC Riverside Entrepreneurial Proof of Concept and
    Innovation Center (EPIC). EPIC is a regional program that operates in partnership
    with the County and major local cities to offer a suite of services and tools
    to help teams of innovators and entrepreneurs launch knowledge-based companies.
    In addition, UCR partnered with Riverside City College to allow their upper level
    students to participate as I-Corps team members. To ensure representative participation
    of females and students from underrepresented minorities, EPIC designates successful
    I-Corps graduates as Student Ambassadors to promote and mentor students from those
    two groups. Teams completing the EPIC I-Corps workshops receive additional support
    from EPIC's suite of services and from other programs offered by EPIC's network
    of regional partners.\n\nActive collaboration with the region's universities and
    community colleges, regional incubators and accelerators create synergies within
    the region and accelerate development of the needed ecosystem that will attract
    and create knowledge-based companies and jobs. The success of EPIC and the UCR
    NSF I-Corps site are instrumental in the creation of the ecosystem needed to support
    innovation and entrepreneurship at UCR and in Riverside County, a region that
    lacks history and experience in entrepreneurism. Long-term outcomes of this initiative
    will be greater retention of UCR graduates in the region, increased employment
    from company creation and the relocation of knowledge-based businesses to Riverside
    County. These high-paying technology jobs represent a major economic stimulus
    into a region whose economy has historically been based on agriculture and low-wage
    jobs."

    This project, from Penn State University, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site, operated under the umbrella of the Invent Penn State Initiative and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, supports the translation of university research, develops partnerships between the university and regional economic development organizations and the national I-Corps Network, and trains students to be the drivers of research commercialization.

    The Penn State I-Corps Site teams that pursue commercialization through two different programs, the TechCelerator@State College and the Happy Valley LaunchBox. These two programs are structured to nurture innovator teams using Lean Startup methodology and embody the notion of nurturing innovators both with deep craft and fresh eyes, that is, people with some who have depth of technical expertise as well as those with a fresh perspective on new markets, communication technologies, and consumer concepts. The TechCelerator Program, established in 2011 seeks to accelerate the commercialization of University technology. The Happy Valley Launchbox, created in 2015, is a community-university accelerator that makes extensive use of Lean Startup principles and Design Thinking to help teams bring their ideas into the marketplace. The I-Corps Site program provides funds to teams that are either selected out of one of these programs or have members combined from both programs to support the translation of university technology. The I-Corps Site also engages the broad network of Penn State Innovation hubs across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

    The outcomes of this project have the potential for significant broader impacts across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the region. Initial activity focuses on Penn State's main University Park Campus. However, Invent Penn State operates 13 community innovation hubs throughout the State, affiliated with the University's network of Commonwealth campuses. In addition, the Penn State I-Corps Site, in collaboration with the Upstate New York regional I-Corps Node will run summer programs to train leaders from the commonwealth innovation hubs in Lean startup methodology and will engage their promising teams with the Upstate New York (UNY) regional I-Corps Node.

    This project, from Vanderbilt University, creates an NSF I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Vanderbilt University is investing in building an innovation ecosystem in the Middle Tennessee region. The institution plays a significant role in providing pathways to commercialization for scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics related research and new startup endeavors. In 2016, Vanderbilt opened its Wond'ry, a new innovation center that serves its entire community of faculty, students, and staff across all academic disciplines. The Wond?ry provides a facility to host and implement the NSF I-Corps Sites program. Since its opening, the Wond'ry inspired innovation and entrepreneurial interest on campus. Combined with the I-Corps Site it becomes the primary pipeline to commercialization for many aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs. Implementing the I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt makes a positive difference by advancing on-campus activities related to scouting, recruiting, educating supporting and contributing to the National Innovation Network. The two primary outcomes of the I-Corps at Vanderbilt Program are growing a talented diverse and globally competitive workforce of STEM and Life Scientists that are trained to think entrepreneurially about discovery, and nuturing and supporting multiple, local teams to transition their new innovations and research into the marketplace.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt University goals are twofold: 1) to effectively integrate educational opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students on innovation and entrepreneurship within the traditional STEM and Life science curriculum, and 2) to motivate scientists to engage further in customer discovery as part of their scientific agenda, in the hopes that they will devote their science to addressing and solving problems and real needs in society. The Site at Vanderbilt helps overcome commercialization challenges by incorporating a for-credit course built heavily on the I-Corps curriculum and through the hosting of workshops that provide an introduction to customer discovery and business canvas development. By providing a proven model of success and more cohesive structure, the program ensures that faculty, staff, and students receive the best possible training and are introduced to a vast array of regional and national entrepreneurial resources.

    The I-Corps Site at Vanderbilt trains participants to 1) create solutions to problems with significant positive impact on communities, 2) focus on research with major economic development opportunities, and 3) develop into globally competitive as STEM entrepreneurs. Society will ultimately benefit via an improvement in quality of life through the solutions created to address real-world issues. Middle Tennessee will benefit by having a cohort of well-trained entrepreneurs who, by completing the I-Corps program, will better understand how to identify a viable commercial opportunity and subsequently oversee its successful operational implementation and launch. This will speed the translation of research into new technologies. The subsequent positive economic impacts will occur via these increases in commercialization activities and the number of useful intellectual property disclosures. Subsequent agreements with commercial partners will then grow the region's entrepreneurial ecosystem and empower STEM-entrepreneurs in larger numbers than ever before, thus increasing self confidence in undertaking entrepreneurial endeavors and thus contributing positively to our nation's overall economic growth and vibrancy.

    accelerate the commercialization of student, faculty and regional innovations
    into the marketplace, foster and facilitate the exchange of ideas between the
    university and industry and prepare students to become entrepreneurs. This I-Corps
    Sites project: \n1. Supports and expands an entrepreneurial culture in a region
    where entrepreneurs historically have not had significant assistance; \n2. Expands
    opportunities for undergraduate and graduate business and STEM students so that
    they are able obtain hands-on experience in the implementation of product validation
    activities and to engage in real-world STEM-related business projects; \n3. Assists
    STEM faculty to become more comfortable with the practice of marketing their inventions
    by introducing them to the I-Corps theory and practice of the I-Corps methodology;
    \n4. Integrates the I-Corps methodology throughout the UTRGV infrastructure so
    that the university will be able to carry out its mission of \"transforming Texas
    and the nation through the commercialization of university discoveries\".\n\nThere
    are several advantages to having an I-Corps site at UTRGV: being located directly
    on the U-S.-Mexican border, the UTRGV I-Corps is unique in that it the site is
    both binational and bicultural; and, the region that UTRGV serves is one of the
    fastest growing yet impoverished areas in the country. Promoting support for entrepreneurship
    in such a region demonstrates how well the I-Corps methodology works in a historically
    underserved area of the country.\n\nThis project advances the commercialization
    of ideas that come from the STEM colleges and departments within UTRGV by providing
    STEM faculty and students with a methodology to promote their products and ideas
    in the marketplace. It also broadens the participation of normally underrepresented
    Hispanic students in the commercialization process. Ultimately, it will benefit
    the regional economy of deep-south Texas by providing support for start-up businesses
    and it will enhance the research enterprise at UTRGV through the creation of interdisciplinary
    teams."

    This project, at the University of Arkansas (UA), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution that involves participants from three UA campuses.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Arkansas I-Corps Site, STEP (STEAM Training in Entrepreneurial Practices), builds on university activities and programs that accelerate the commercialization of research by faculty and students. In addition, several UA Research Centers and Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Sites will involve affiliated faculty and students in STEP, a 10-week summer program that is divided into two phases. Phase I, with 15 teams, will focus on instruction in lean startup principles and initial customer discovery interviews. Phase II, with eight teams that receive additional funding, will further develop the most promising business ideas from Phase I. The STEP site will include undergraduate and graduate student teams and faculty from three UA System campuses: the University of Arkansas (UA), the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), and the University of Arkansas Little Rock (UALR).

    Although the state of Arkansas has made progress in the development of high-growth businesses based on university research outcomes over the past decade, Arkansas continues to be one of the most economically challenged states in the country. The STEP Site encourages researchers to expand their horizons beyond the research they are doing in their labs and consider how the commercialization of their inventions might help promote economic development in the state. In addition to the broader impact of economic development, the STEP Site enables the university to continue its efforts to improve entrepreneurial education for females and underrepresented populations. The university's successful programs for underrepresented high school through graduate students provide a base upon which to build these efforts.

    training based on the Lean LaunchPad methodology, (2) expands USC's current engagement
    with seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to foster mentoring of junior entrepreneurs.
    This is accomplished through a three-tier strategy that entails one-on-one mentoring,
    an Expert-in-Residence program, student internships in start-ups, and (3) fosters

    an emphasis on customer discovery, networking, and strategic partnerships. The
    tangible outcomes include new opportunities for research funding, strengthened
    academia-industrial connections, and unique exposure of students to real world
    translational research. A secondary outcome of this program is the evolution of
    academic culture that values entrepreneurship and is more proactive in taking
    risk and finding resources to bring ideas to reality. This transition in academic

    its role in economic development and job creation.\n\nThe outreach portion of
    this Site is geared toward improving diversity inclusion and enhancing participation
    of underrepresented groups through a wider dissemination of educational activities.
    The broader impacts are four-fold. First, the educational framework offers an
    immersive experience that prepares students to identify and pursue high impact
    opportunities regardless of their vocation. Second, it fosters the innovation
    ecosystem by promoting collaborations between faculty and business partners. This
    stimulates the commercial translation of fundamental research, and exposes the
    local business community to USC's research capacity. Third, it puts in place a
    robust framework for I-Corps team formation to enhance the chance of success of
    USC entrepreneurs in competing for SBIR/STTR and follow-on funding. Fourth, the

UB receives over eighty invention disclosures annually that result in patents, licenses, and the formation of startup companies. To train participant entrepreneurial teams, UB's Business & Entrepreneur Partnerships in the Office of Economic Development (BEP) offers a unique two-phase, resource-efficient training process in the areas of: Customer Discovery, Lean Startup methods, The Business Model Canvas, Developing a prioritized list of testable hypotheses and open questions, and Assessing the strength of an opportunity. Under Phase I, teams receive workshop instruction, work closely with mentors and practice customer discovery. Phase II training integrates intensive customer engagement. UB views the NSF I-Corps Site program as an important way to: 1) perform more robust technical and commercial assessments of new technologies; 2) increase inventors' entrepreneurial skills leading to system-wide culture change; 3) improve the quality of future research proposals; 4) increase commercialization success; 5) prepare inventors and students for success in the I-Corps Node program; 6) pursue SBIR/STTR funding; and 6) provide graduate students and postdocs with a world class experience that will impact their entire careers.

    The UB I-Corps Site program broader impacts are realized through the creation of a network of strategic partnerships between researchers and engaged commercial interests. These relationships increase: industry-sponsored research funding; competitive SBIR/STTR applications; pivotal student experiences; campus-wide, interdisciplinary collaborations; the level of industry mentorship; the number and quality of invention disclosures; participation of 5-10 teams (annually) in the I-Corps Node Program; and overall culture change (innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative, multidisciplinary). UB's Technology Transfer Office is joined by a number of other units and strategic partners - an inclusivity that extends the impact of the I-Corps Site award across the campus, into the business community, and supports a greater public mission.

    This project, from the University of Utah, creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.

    NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a "renewal" of funding for an existing I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.

    The University of Utah I-Corps Site program encourages and assists students and faculty in transitioning research projects to commercialization by providing education, training, resources and networking required for understanding markets, customers, product-market fit and to answer business and/or technology questions. The I-Corps Site program at the University of Utah is currently in its 3rd year and has trained nearly 90 teams and over 150 participants. The program resulted in successful business and technology go/no-go decisions, successful transition to commercialization, and helped advance five technologies to the commercial start-up stage. This extension focuses on refining the curriculum by implementing lessons learned in the first three years of the program, developing new teams and generating more successful transitions, as well as implementing the new financing model that will assure future program sustainability without further government funding.

    The Utah I-Corps Site enhances and builds upon this institution's existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. This Site initiated the development of a model of transitioning from research-based technologies to viable commercial products in academic environment that allows the university to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of underrepresented participants. This extension further generalizes and disseminates the developed curriculum and implements agreements and procedures to assure its future financial sustainability. Partnership networks within the university support underrepresented student and faculty groups and offer the support and resources needed to help such groups thrive and participate in the process and, as the program becomes self-sustaining, will be extended, through internships and special courses to other colleges and local high schools. Thus, the program helps increase the diversity of the regional business environment leading to enhanced growth and economic prosperity for all citizens in the region.

    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
    and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation
    locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors,
    researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nRutgers University has funded research
    of over $600M per year. This research generates over 150 patents each year and
    more than $15M in licensing income annually. A challenge is to transition research
    outcomes to the commercialization stage. The Rutgers University I-Corps Site cultivates
    this pool of early stage ideas and assists with bringing viable concepts through
    the commercialization pathway to the marketplace. Through the I-Corps Site, with
    targeted training and mentoring, I-Corps teams are sourced from the Rutgers Site
    partners. These include the Office of Research Commercialization, educational
    activities ranging from the Collaboration for Technology Entrepreneurship and
    Commercialization (CTEC) and Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs, senior-year
    \"capstone\" engineering design and Honors College programs, and many other feeder
    programs. Mentors are matched to these teams. Inventors benefit from the larger
    innovation ecosystem in the New Jersey/New York region, as the Site partners with
    the NYCRIN I-Corps Node. \n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps Site provides training, mentoring,
    and access to a large network of business, technical and financial resources.
    The signature activity of this program is that each year, 30 teams participate
    and test the commercial potential of their products with a broad base of consumers.
    This program promotes the value of commercialization to both faculty and students,
    and reinforces the concept that ideas generated by the academic research process
    can have societal and commercial value.\n\nThe Rutgers I-Corps bridges the gap
    between the lab and the marketplace, enhancing the University's commitment to
    fostering economic development across New Jersey and beyond. As the number of
    spin-outs from the university increases, jobs are created and companies hire students
    as interns and graduates as full-time employees. The program's impact goes beyond
    the University by tapping into local business leaders and entrepreneurs for team
    mentorship as well as expanding programs to support the communities around Rutgers
    campuses and to particularly assist underrepresented inventors and business-owners.
    A key area of focus is to increase I-Corps participation from women in STEM and
    ultimately to increase the number of women-owned businesses in the region/state."

    I-Corps Type II proposal is to continue the existing NSF I-Corps Site program
    at MIT. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals are submitted
    by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals
    may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThis Site will continue
    to support MIT researchers that are working on new, innovative and differentiating
    technologies. To date, over seventy teams have participated in the MIT I-Corps
    Site training programs and the total will be well over 100 by the end of the initial
    award. Ten teams have completed the NSF National Team Program and two more have
    been accepted. Collectively, the graduates have received over $8 million in additional
    grants or awards to continue developing their technologies. Six companies have
    submitted SBIR or STTR proposals and four have been awarded so far. Two companies
    were accepted into accelerator programs. The startups have raised over $6.5 million
    in early stage investment and at least twenty-five new jobs have been created.
    Three of the companies have successfully reached commercialization of their publicly
    funded new technologies. Additional outcomes show that participants learn new
    skills both professionally as well as in entrepreneurship. The training contributes
    to their current research and has affected how they will conduct their future
    research by including commercialization potential as part of their planning. Site
    participants benefit from a Team Mentoring approach through a partnership with
    the MIT Venture Mentoring Service that continues beyond their I-Corps training.
    The mentor team framework increases rates of learning and provides continuity
    in nurturing the teams as they advance their ideas.\n\nMIT's activities are likely
    to have broad impact including: encouraging entrepreneurial aspirations and providing
    researchers with training and activities to understand the entrepreneurial process
    allowing them to greatly increase their future prospects while still within the
    academic environment; attracting and supporting a greater number of students,
    faculty and other researchers to actively explore the possibilities of translating
    their research into future commercial applications, ensuring the supply needed
    to fuel the continuous flow of innovations needed by society; and, encouraging
    more women and other underrepresented participants to become engaged and reach
    successful outcomes, serving as visible role models to accelerate the participation
    of others. Finally, through its existing and active Outreach Program, MIT VMS
    will disseminate both the knowledge and practical techniques to its large and
    growing network of universities that have launched mentoring programs based upon
    the VMS model."

    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nThis Site leverages Northeastern's entrepreneurship ecosystem as
    well as that of the larger Boston innovation ecosystem. The foundation for the
    program is a growing body of funded research which offers untapped opportunities
    for commercialization. To facilitate entrepreneurship, Northeastern created a
    series of entrepreneurship courses for undergraduate and graduate students, as
    well as an on-campus incubator feeding ventures into the local investment community.\n\nThe
    Northeastern I-Corps Site program substantially increases both the quantity and
    quality of STEM-related ventures founded through its Site. The I-Corps Site program
    also leverage Northeastern's technology licensing office as well as its Mentor
    and Investors Networks in support of Site teams. There are 280 active individual
    Mentors supporting Northeastern's startups, as well as a variety of angel and
    venture capital investors who regularly assess Northeastern ventures, fifty of
    which have garnered $70 million in venture finance over the past three years.
    \n\nNortheastern University's entrepreneurship system is based on the meta-process
    of Educate, Incubate, and Launch. The I-Corp Site program is a highly focused
    way to a) better recruit a specific graduate, postdoc, and faculty population
    of potential technological entrepreneurs, and b) provide initial entrepreneurship
    and innovation education and training for them. Northeastern is also conducting
    research to more clearly understand the effect of entrepreneurial learning for
    first time entrepreneurs in its own incubator, focusing on the specific areas
    of developing customer insight, new product and service solutions, and business
    models. Several I-Corp ventures are already part of this study.\n\nNortheastern's
    Site goals are to increase the number and quality of technology ventures emerging
    from laboratories and to feed new ventures into the I-Corps National program.
    Another important impact is that I-Corps offers a complementary pathway for early
    stage ventures to pursue initial funding through I-Corps Node and SBIR/STTR programs.
    Another potential impact is the expansion of this program in subsequent years
    to early stage entrepreneurs working in the numerous research environments within
    one mile of the Northeastern campus. These institutions include the medical schools
    and hospitals affiliated with Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University, as well as
    organizations pursuing research in robotics, cybersecurity, and IoT among other

    This project, at the University of Georgia, creates an I-Corps Site (I-Corps UGA) at that institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

     I-Corps UGA strengthens entrepreneurship and commercialization in the local and regional ecosystem and supports the growth and diversification of Georgia's economy. I-Corps UGA will increase the participation of women and minority students in the resulting innovation network through active collaboration with other local and regional educational institutions serving minority and underrepresented populations. By leveraging, strengthening, and expanding its existing innovation network at the University of GA, the I-Corps UGA enhances the regional and national capacity to support STEM technology development and commercialization. In doing so I-Corps UGA nurtures and supports faculty and student innovators and increases the number of STEM technologies brought to the market. This project demonstrates a strong existing foundation in Business Model Canvas and Lean Startup methodologies. Partnerships with groups such as the Office of Institutional Diversity, Peach State LSAMP, the UGA Women's Leadership Initiative, Terry College's Women's Initiative and with a HBU will lead to broader inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in the program.

    This project, from New York University (NYU), creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    NYU Tandon School of Engineering (NYU-SoE) Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) will "encourage and support diversity in STEM entrepreneurship, among women in particular, by encouraging social entrepreneurship, an approach that has shown to be attractive to women." Using the Lean LaunchPad approach infused with insights into supporting diversity, teams will receive funding for customer discovery, prototyping, and other resources to support commercialization across multiple academic terms. This approach is supported by a strong network of faculty and mentors who have exhibited an excellent record of previous NSF funding and commercialization successes.

    The intellectual merit of this proposal incorporates the proposition that social entrepreneurship is more attractive to underrepresented groups, particularly women. By pursuing avenues that will increase diversity in both STEM and entrepreneurship, through the training, programs, and mentorship of the site, this project may serve as an exemplar for I-Corps nationally.

    This project, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) creates an extension and expansion of their current I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem.

    This proposal from the University of Virginia (UVA) creates and I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The UVA I-Corps Site is a natural extension of the entrepreneurship efforts already in place on the campus. UVA has an extensive set of offerings for its students to learn about the basics of entrepreneurship. The University also has resources for proof of concept that fund teams building prototypes and testing product market fit. The UVA Site will provide the opportunity for early-stage support to help nascent teams take the first step toward commercialization. The Site will help fill the gap between a potentially marketable idea developed in one of the academic centers on campus and several existing translational funds that can provide more meaningful support for a promising start-up team, such as the Coulter Translational Research Partnership, the Biomedical Innovation Fund, the LaunchPad for Diabetes, and the LVG Seed Fund. The fit of the I-Corps program into the existing ecosystem makes UVA a very strong candidate for an I-Corps site. The project will have predictable broader impacts through its effect on the local and regional ecosystems - enabling the launch of new ventures to create jobs and improve the economy.

    This project, from the University of Toledo, will extend and expand their current Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Site. I-Corps Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The University of Toledo is repositioning their site program into one that will directly support commercialization of faculty-led research. This is a shift away from the focus of their prior site grant, which supported interdisciplinary, undergraduate-student entrepreneurship. The goal of their new site program is to send teams to the national I-Corps program and prepare them for applying for SBIR and other external funding. They will hold four short courses each year, for 30+ teams. The Site and their personnel have been active nationally, are producing successful teams, are sending teams to the National program, and are launching companies. They have built a Mentor pool to support their teams. They have strong comprehension of the I-Corps program and close collaboration with their regional I-Corps Node. The existence of a Site in Toledo has already had an impact on the region's ecosystem and also at the state level. Leveraging the two I-Corps Sites in Ohio (at Toledo and Akron), the state of Ohio legislated I-Corps@Ohio to expand the support commercialization. The Toledo Site also collaborates with the Rocket Venture Fund and other incubator facilities.

    This project, from the City University of New York (CUNY) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.  Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.

    The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion.

    This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Santa Cruz (UC-SC). The proposal outlines a focused summer program of eight weeks targeted at the under-represented population of the university. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    Particular strengths of the proposal include: offering the I-Corps curriculum during a summer program that is well articulated; targeting under-served students in a region with potential for significant impact; an unusual mix of social, not-for-profit startups with for-profit ones; a strong collaboration with the Bay Area I-Corps Node; the commitment from the university to support the I-Corps focused activities; and, there is likely to be an impact not only on the region but also on the students, 25% of who are Hispanic. This project could potentially serve as a model for others to replicate.

    This project, from Mississippi State University, establishes an I-Corps Site in the institution's Center for Entrepreneurship and Outreach (CEO).  NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The Mississippi State CEO coordinates the efforts of the Office of Technology Management (OTM) and the E-Center to administer the I-Corps Site project. The goal is to recruit and manage thirty teams a year, with the objective of creating viable businesses based on university research.

    Mississippi State has combined their entrepreneurship center with outreach under an EDA University Center - creating the potential for better than average connections with regional businesses and recruiting representatives of those businesses to participate in the I-Corps Site activities. MS has already solidified some company connections and recruited an advisory board.

    There are clear goals for the Site and Mississippi State University has already started to translate research into businesses. Their existing entrepreneurship program is in line with I-Corps and this grant will help them scale-up those efforts. They have experience collaborating with the Southwest I-Corps Node and plans to continue that collaboration. They have a way to support teams that develop new ideas as well as an I-Corps-centric curriculum in place. They have a robust tracking/assessment plan for the program and the individual teams, an asset to the proposal and will help them to measure the impact of the program.

    The site has the potential to have high in on economically distressed and minority populations.  30% of this institution's entering freshman class and 16% of their faculty belong to minority groups.  In addition there is a program that provides support for veterans starting a business. This is a well-structured and thought out project that contains all of the elements that are needed to support a successful I-Corps Site.  It is clear from data they have provided that a Site at this institution would have a significant impact on the university and the region as well as the faculty and students at this institution.

    This project is a renewal of the Bay Area Regional I-Corps Node to continue creating a robust and broad-based entrepreneurship infrastructure built on the scientific, technology, and engineering strengths as well as the business thought leadership of three globally recognized universities, the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Stanford University. This I-Corps Node will continue building on its success of applying and disseminating the Lean Launchpad methodology through classes and training for both new trainers and early-stage startups. These startups will drive creation of sustainable, scalable science and technology-based startups with both regional and national impacts. The I-Corps Node also will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship among science and engineering faculty and students, using specialized programs to drive forcing mechanisms for collaboration. The success of the I-Corps Node itself will be the subject of continual evaluation and analysis, consistent with Lean LaunchPad principles, to develop and disseminate best practices for this region and the nation. A central focus of the Node's work will be finding more efficient ways of solving the two-sided market of connecting scientific and technical talent with business talent. A key question that will be elucidated by this I-Corps Node's research is whether structured mechanisms or a more organic approach will achieve the most favorable outcomes.

    The partner schools have been key contributors to the National Innovation Network in the development of new curriculum and advanced tools. The Node will continue to disseminate the Lean LaunchPad classes widely throughout the Node via classes like Hacking For Defense at Stanford. The Node will also create specialized programs for government funded research centers within universities and governmental agencies ,such as NSA, with the ultimate goal of financial sustainability. The training products and programs created by the I-Corps Node will have broad impact through their widespread dissemination throughout the Node network and beyond. All activities and programs at the I-Corps Node will facilitate the inclusion of groups from diverse regions, economic backgrounds, and ethnicities.

    This project by the University of Michigan I-Corps Node, one of the founding NSF I-Corps nodes, will expand the founding Node into a comprehensive regional node called I-Corps Midwest. I-Corps Midwest Node brings together the University of Michigan (UM) as the lead institution, and the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, and Purdue University as partner institutions. This Node is uniquely suited to serve the Midwest entrepreneurial ecosystem by bridging rural communication gaps that typically lead to an uninformed commercial opportunity around research inventions, difficulty in retaining and accessing talent with sufficient breadth of specific and relevant expertise, and instilling customer discovery memory across I-Corps programs allowing entrepreneurial researchers to leverage learning from previous I-Corps teams.

    This project will create mechanisms to overcome the consequences of low ecosystem density by building on the existing partner university collaborations and create an active and cohesive network that leverages their collective commercialization pipeline, previous experiences, and connections. The Node will form a deeper understanding of the individual motivations and experiences of the faculty and students as they participate in I-Corps programs. This knowledge will help to continue driving culture change at these institutions and create the innovation human capital needed to move research ideas forward into the marketplace. The Node will create measurements of network activity and the resulting outcomes will provide information on which methodologies are effective and should be propagated to other regional clusters and the nation. This project builds on the previous four years of work by NSF to create collaborations that are critically important for institutions that are not located in entrepreneurially dense areas to reach and prepare individuals to compete on a national and international level.

    I-Corps, a five-week training program teaching Value Proposition Design and the
    Customer Discovery process. Aggie I-Corps provides teams with training, resources,
    networking opportunities, and seed funding to move their ventures towards the
    market, along with a range of follow-on funding through local competitions, NSF
    I-Corps, SBIR/STTR, and private investors. Aggie I-Corps is offered three times
    annually and serves a total of 30 teams per year. Teams are identified through
    a competitive application process intended to identify innovations across campus
    in areas typically funded by the NSF.\n\nA novel aspect of the Aggie I-Corps program
    is the focus on Value Proposition Design as opposed to Business Model Design,
    which is the subject of most I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad programs. The purpose
    for the shift to Value Proposition Design is to focus on the two most challenging
    segments of Business Model Canvas: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. The
    core hypothesis is that dedicated training using Value Proposition Canvas will
    serve as a better introduction to entrepreneurship and the Lean LaunchPad methodology
    than starting with the full Business Model Canvas. If successful, the Aggie I-Corps
    could serve as a model for introductory entrepreneurship programs and future I-Corps
    Sites preparing teams for the National I-Corps program.\n\nNMSU and Arrowhead
    have been growing a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, particularly
    through their Studio G, NMSU/Arrowhead's student business accelerator. In the
    past two years, 80 new member startups were added, involving over 150 student
    entrepreneurs. This rapid growth signifies a large demand for entrepreneurship
    training at NMSU. Aggie I-Corps is an opportunity to build on this current momentum
    and offer student entrepreneurs dedicated training and support to pursue their
    own startups. Aggie I-Corps offers the initial capital for participants to pursue
    their projects to the point of raising additional funding by leveraging the training
    and market research gained through the program. Aggie I-Corps positions STEM-based
    entrepreneurs to win follow-on funding through local competitions, federal funding
    applications and private investment solicitations. \n\nAggie I-Corps is having
    a significant impact on the improvement of the culture of entrepreneurship and
    innovation at NMSU, which yields dividends beyond the training and funding of
    Aggie I-Corps participants. The impact goes beyond the university and contributes
    to the regional ecosystem of entrepreneurship."

    established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
    and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nUNH's I-Corps Site enables faculty
    researchers and trainees to explore the commercial potential of their discoveries.
    The application of the Lean Launchpad (LLP) curriculum, intellectual networking
    events, access to business and scientific mentors, and funding mechanisms help
    participants in identifying the critical path to commercialization and ways to
    reach the market with innovative ideas more efficiently. UNH Innovation, which
    is the unit primarily responsible for entrepreneurial activities and technology
    commercialization at UNH, hosts the I-Corps Site.\n\nUNH's existing commercialization
    infrastructure is coordinated to increase the likelihood that research can be
    quickly exposed to the I-Corps program. At least 30 I-Corps Teams are trained
    each year and participate in the UNH Flywheel process. Highlights of this innovative
    process include:\n   (1) Exposure to a four-week Lean Launch Pad (LLP) course
    focusing on customer discovery and value proposition; \n   (2) A 10-week LLP course
    with exposure to the entire business model canvas; \n   (3) A demo day to showcase
    ideas; and \n   (4) Twice-yearly Sandpits, where multiple subject matter experts
    are invited to an open discussion on a general topic to promote interdisciplinary
    and trans-disciplinary conversations. \nPromising projects are connected to business
    mentors, are eligible for new translational funding, and are provided access to
    local incubator and angel/venture capital networks to accelerate market entry
    of ideas.\n\nImplementation of this I-Corp Site constitutes a redesign of the
    ecosystem in such a way as to increase interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary
    collaboration throughout UNH's $110MM research portfolio, and develop connections
    to available resources necessary to ensure that discoveries fulfill their economic
    and social potential. \n\nTo assess the impact of this redesign, this proposal
    contains an innovative approach to program assessment. While tracking well-established
    metrics such as invention disclosures, licenses, and startup activity, UNH also
    tracks qualitative and social network measures to help assess deeper changes in
    UNH?s innovation ecosystem. This more robust measurement approach not only assists
    in future improvements in UNH's innovation ecosystem, but also increases the scalability
    and transferability of lessons learned and insights gained at UNH?' I-Corps Site
    to the national innovation network.\n\nThe UNH Site impacts transcend exposure
    to and access by faculty and students to LLP coursework.  Startup formation and
    job creation are expanded as a direct result of UNH research and an improved culture
    of commercialization on campus. The UNH Flywheel process (1) exposes the regional
    and national business communities to UNH?s research capacity, (2) increases research
    collaborations between faculty and industry; and (3) improves connections between
    graduate students and the local business community. The program works with existing
    organizations on campus like the Society for Women Engineers, Luna Cats, UNH ADVANCE,
    UNH chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, and the Associate Vice
    President for Community, Equity, and Diversity to ensure recruitment and enrollment
    for programs is well advertised and broadens the participation of underrepresented

    training following the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and resources for customer discovery
    and market need analysis to 90-112 teams of students, faculty, researchers, and
    mentors.  The program bridges campus wide research in science, engineering, medicine,
    and student projects, all of which can lead to potential innovations - with Dartmouth's
    suite of entrepreneurial services offered through its Office of Entrepreneurship
    and Technology Transfer (OETT). \n\nThe intellectual merit of Dartmouth's I-Corps
    Site is the creation of a consistent curriculum that helps scientists, engineers,
    and students frame their discoveries in the context of how they can be used outside
    of the academic institution. The program helps a nascent entrepreneurs to place
    their discovery into one of three categories: continued academic exploration,
    pursuit of its use within the market discovered through program participation,
    or reevaluation with the intent of determining whether a market and need exists
    in a completely different area. \n\nThe objective of the Dartmouth I-Corps Site
    is to engage and equip more students and researchers at all levels - undergraduate,
    graduate, post-doctoral, and faculty - to move their discoveries out of academia
    and into the marketplace. Dartmouth I-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops are held
    twice annually during Dartmouth's interim periods in December and June.  Using
    the workshops as a springboard and seed funding from the grant, teams perform
    customer discovery, form a value proposition, and determine market need and size
    beginning with the workshop and for a three-month period following the workshop.
    After completing the program, participants are prepared to either rethink their
    discovery or move forward with commercialization. If a team concludes that a discovery
    has commercial value, the team will be well positioned to take advantage of the
    support of the OETT, the NSF I-Corps program, Dartmouth's alumni support network,
    local angel investors, and other organizations.\n\nBroader Impacts: \nThe broader
    impacts of this program lie in its objective to create a campus environment that
    fosters innovation and produces graduates who understand and can engage in defining
    value and identifying need as they launch their careers. Dartmouth's enrollment
    of underrepresented minorities and women in its undergraduate and graduate STEM
    programs significantly exceed national averages; women represent 42% and 48%,
    respectively, of the current senior and junior engineering classes, and 30% of
    declared Computer Science majors. Sciences consistently enroll approximately 50%
    women. The engineering school's first-of-its-kind Ph.D. Innovation program, established
    in 2008, has graduated 30% women or underrepresented minorities. Feeders into
    Dartmouth's I-Corps Sites program come from courses and research laboratories
    from across Dartmouth's college of Arts & Sciences and three professional schools
    and all levels and engage these traditionally underrepresented populations in
    innovation as a natural outcome of the project activities. In order to broaden
    impact to the years beyond the I-Corps grant, investigators will use project outcomes
    to seek alumni support for offering of the Site curriculum and seed funding programs
    semi-annually."

    ecosystem and entrepreneurial community in the TN region through the delivery
    of the I-Corps curriculum and support to 30+ teams per year. This activity will
    leverage existing partnerships between Tennessee Technological University (TTU),
    ORNL and the Biz Foundry to accelerate commercialization through training, enhanced

    university research infrastructure and the Launch Tennessee (LaunchTN) accelerator
    network. The TTU Site builds on the existing research experience at TTU by adding
    specific commercialization training and experience for teams that are composed
    of various combinations of students, faculty, members of industry and scientists.
    The TTU I-Corps Site expands the innovation and technical commercialization infrastructure
    at TTU by:\n     1) Building skill sets among students, faculty, engineers and
    community startups, and\n     2) Moving technology from academia, government,
    and industry toward commercialization. \nThis project achieves the goals of the
    Innovation Corps Sites Program by facilitating the translation of research, encouraging
    collaboration between academia and industry, and training students to understand
    innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E). This funding allows TTU to support teams
    whose projects are likely candidates for commercialization.\n\nThe innovation
    Site at TTU is built around the national I-Corps model, and its focused training
    experience, and consists of three stages to recruit, immerse and support technical
    entrepreneurs in the innovation and entrepreneurship lifecycle. The stages are:\n
    \    1) Team origination and recruitment \n     2) Formal I-Corps training\n     3)
    Post-training support\nThese stages are designed to improve the pathway to successful
    commercialization and develop the participants as better innovators and contributors
    to the NSF I-Corps network. \n\nTennessee (TN) state entrepreneurial startups,
    as exemplified by SBIR/STTR funding, fall in the 3rd quartile ranking with a 37%
    decrease in the past two decades. Until recently, most TN entrepreneurs have had
    limited or no access to training or opportunities to grow their startup. The TTU
    Site participates in and contributes to the broader knowledge of entrepreneurship
    research and its impact on engineering education and adds to the database of innovators
    in the NSF I-Corps network. In particular, this Site aids in understanding the

    The intellectual merit of this proposal is that this program allows highly educated scientists and engineers to acquire real-life research experience and to bring the latest innovative theories and techniques from the academic community o the country?s entrepreneurial technology sector. By working in a cutting-edge laboratory where research and development are accomplished within a framework of expected business outcomes and business constraints, researchers learn to work in multidisciplinary teams and to apply their academic expertise to the important work of product development and application in a globally competitive environment. The small businesses benefit from the fresh insights and most current technological skills and training that the recent postdoctoral students would bring. The program puts those skills and that training to work at creative and inventive research companies which otherwise would not be able to afford such expertise. These pairings would provide active SBIR Phase II companies the opportunity to enhance innovative collaboration, strengthen scientific rigor, and quicken the pace of technological breakthrough. Fellows are also encouraged to publish their work within the overall publishing guidelines set by each participating company.


    The broader impact of this program is to broaden participation of underrepresented groups such as women, African
    Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders in small high-tech companies supported by the NSF SBIR/STTR program. ASEE has proposed stronger outreach strategies than implemented in the current grant to increase visibility and diversity by reaching out to institutions that supply a high number of candidates from underrepresented demographic groups. ASEE is strengthening its outreach by attending postdoctoral and professional organizational conferences that typically target women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields and by having a proactive presence in social media.

    is a novel partnership involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities
    (HBCUs), with assistance from the DC I-Corps Node, a regional I-Corps node supporting
    the DC-MD-VA region. The partnership supports enhanced participation of HBCU students
    and faculty from Howard and Hampton universities in technology transfer and venture
    creation by leveraging DC I-Corps' expertise in the Lean Launch Pad philosophy
    and curriculum. DC I-Corps benefits from the Site's regional alignment to accelerate
    the participation of African-Americans in future I-Corps Node cohorts thereby
    enhancing diversity. I-Corps activities on each campus and assessment of these
    targeted programs also informs strategies for improving innovation and entrepreneurship
    interventions aimed at under-represented minorities (URM) and enhance ongoing
    educational research.\n\nThese institutions are uniquely positioned among the
    HBCUs to undertake this effort. Both institutions are among the inaugural cohort
    of HBCUs participating in the HBCU Innovation and Entrepreneurship Collaborative
    (IEC) organized by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Association of
    Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) to stimulate innovation activity on
    HBCU campuses. The IEC effort connects HBCUs with best practices to implementing
    entrepreneurship and innovation activities on campus. These best practices are
    based on models advocated by Stanford University and the National Collegiate Inventors
    and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA - recently renamed VentureWell), among others.
    \n\nThe partnership between the Howard and Hampton University Site and the DC
    I-Corps Node allows for greater opportunities to assess diversity as a variable
    in innovation and entrepreneurship programming interventions targeting under-represented
    minorities; enhancing fundamental understanding of effective frameworks for LLP
    education for diverse populations. Additionally, the Site seeks to increase technical
    entrepreneurship participation among the HBCU faculty and students by focusing
    on the following activities:\n\n1.\tIncreasing the training of HBCU faculty and
    students in Lean Launchpad methodology.\n2.\tDeveloping a strong inter-related
    network of HBCU entrepreneurs with the NSF I-Corps system. \n3.\tOrganizing and
    growing a diverse mentorship network. \n4.\tEncouraging applications from in response

    original research and new technologies by providing financial support for prototypes
    and customer engagement. Lean Startup training will help teams discover their
    potential customers and product-market fit. \n\nNJIT's support for entrepreneurs
    has four main anchors: the Enterprise Development Center, a 100,000-sq.-foot high
    technology and life sciences business incubator; the newly established NJ Innovation
    Institute; the NJ Innovation Acceleration Center, an initiative of School of Management
    and the Office of Technology Development; and the NJIT Undergraduate Research
    and Innovation initiative where students form interdisciplinary teams and participate
    in experiential research activities that can solve societal problems.  An NSF
    I-Corps Site at NJIT will help bridge one of the roadblocks to the commercialization
    of research by providing funds for the development of risky early-stage prototypes.
    Faculty/Student teams seeking financial support will be required to participate
    in Lean Startup training and entrepreneurial networking that will help them to
    transition from researchers to potential innovators and entrepreneurs. \n\nAn
    NSF I-Corps Site at NJIT will establish a robust pathway to market for original
    research and new technologies by cross-fertilizing academic, entrepreneurial,
    and corporate participation. The grant will further enhance NJIT's relationship
    with the entrepreneurial and corporate communities as we bring community members
    onto campus as mentors for the I-Corps Site teams. \n\nAn I-Corps Site at NJIT
    will create pathway for underrepresented teams to participate in the NSF I-Corps
    program and support the mission of promoting science and technology to advance
    the national health. By combining academic research activities with commercialization
    activities, the I-Corp Site at NJIT will foster experiential teaching, training,
    and learning for students and faculty. Students and faculty who learn to discover
    the path to commercialization will be able to view research discoveries with greater
    understanding.\n\nThe Kauffman Foundation has recognized that minorities are underrepresented
    among entrepreneurs. All entrepreneurs face resource constraints but the barriers
    to entrepreneurship may be insurmountable for economically disadvantaged students
    and students who don't have a strong network from which to derive resources. An
    NSF I-Corp Site at NJIT will draw students from one of the most diverse campuses
    within the US and will provide early stage funding to women, minorities, and economically
    disadvantaged participants on a meritocratic basis. \n\nLeveling the playing field
    will broaden participation from underrepresented groups and create a new class
    of technology entrepreneurs and will benefit society by helping to move ideas
    out of academic silos. Nearly all net new job growth in the US has come from the
    formation of new companies and the subset of new companies that have grown most
    rapidly has been technology-based companies, the sorts of technology startups
    that would be fostered at NJIT."

    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe UNC Charlotte I-Corp
    Site, the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program, enables a substantial expansion
    of faculty and student customer discovery and startup participation by building
    upon programs and resources that are underway at the University. UNC Charlotte,
    through its Charlotte Research Institute and Ventureprise organizations, offers
    an integrated series of programs that directly address early idea identification,
    customer discovery, startup and growth stage guidance. \n\nThe I-Corps Site funding
    at UNC improves visibility of entrepreneurship, incent broad student and faculty
    participation, and drives commercialization opportunities that leverage the University's
    major investment in innovation and entrepreneurship personnel and infrastructure.
    \ The Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program is likely to yield insights into best
    practices applicable to a public university with a diverse student population
    that includes many first generation college students. The program operates in
    a region with strong corporate operations and modest venture capital presence
    and is designed to engage corporate partners in team evaluation and guidance.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nUNC Charlotte serves more than 26,000 students with a substantial
    population of underrepresented minorities (23% African-American and Hispanic)
    and numerous students from modest economic circumstances. The UNC I-Corps Site
    focuses on this population and on reducing the barriers to STEM entrepreneurial
    participation by all motivated and qualified UNC Charlotte students.\n\nThe rapidly
    growing Charlotte region with 2.6 million residents and strong corporate presence
    participate in the Ventureprise Charlotte Launch Program through mentor engagement
    and community entrepreneur involvement. This creates linkages between the diverse
    student population and community resources, strengthening student network access.
    The I-Corps evidence-based customer discovery methodologies have broader economic
    impact as they infuse the region's innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem.
    The I-Corps Site funding increases engagement of University faculty and students
    with corporate innovation executives located in the Carolinas. This program strengthens
    and expands partnerships among the University, industry, and the entrepreneurial
    community. These partnerships directly affect commercialization and are likely
    to lead to additional collaborative research and other positive outcomes."

    Site accelerates commercialization of technologies developed by UI faculty, students
    and community-based entrepreneurs and has invested in campus-wide infrastructure
    to foster innovation and technology commercialization. Core university entrepreneurship
    and technology commercialization operating units are closely aligned to ensure
    effective and rapid implementation of the UI I-Corps program. The UI has strong
    working relationships with external stakeholders for identifying experienced entrepreneurial
    leaders and mentors and securing financial capital from angel investors, venture
    capitalists and public sector programs to support UI I-Corps teams. \n\nThe establishment
    of a UI I-Corps program significantly improves the campus' entrepreneurial eco-system
    by providing funding for new strategic investments in entrepreneurship education
    and support while leveraging existing commercialization activities.\n\nAt the
    core of the UI I-Corps program is entrepreneurial training; UI Venture School
    is an entrepreneurial training program based on the LeanLaunch Pad and Business
    Model Canvas. The UI offers 6-8 entrepreneurial educational programs annually,
    serving a minimum of 30 commercialization teams. In addition to training, the
    university launches 1) several business and technical support initiatives for
    I-Corps teams including the Summer Accelerator-a 90-day new venture launch program,
    2) UI ProtoLabs-a prototype development program, 3) UI Ventures-a comprehensive
    technical and business development initiative, 4) UI Mentoring-a mentoring program
    connecting UI faculty and students to entrepreneurs, investors and technical experts,
    and 5) a SBIR/STTR grant development assistance program.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe
    UI I-Corps program incorporates mechanisms that may demonstrate the potential
    for how universities can successfully build a campus-wide, interconnected entrepreneurial
    ecosystem through interdisciplinary education and innovation, collaboration with
    colleges, centers, and research units, and partnerships with the private sector.
    UI I-Corps program is expected to: increase the number of UI startup companies;
    intensify interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty, students, entrepreneurs,
    investors and private sector companies; expand the entrepreneurial management
    talent of UI faculty and student entrepreneurs; and support the development and
    commercialization of new technologies designed to solve significant societal challenges.
    \ \n\nIn addition, female entrepreneurs and female led startup companies is the
    focus of the UI I-Corps project. Startup companies led by female CEOs and CTOs
    represent a small fraction of entrepreneurs. The goal of the BI is to increase
    the number of female entrepreneurs on campus to be equal to their male counterpart
    within 5 years. Key elements of the BI approach include: 1) targeted grant funding
    for Gap and startup activities for female entrepreneurs, 2) one-on-one mentoring
    that pairs successful female entrepreneurs with each new female led startup, 3)
    formal recognition of accomplishments, grants and awards by female entrepreneurs,
    4) bringing successful hi-tech female entrepreneurs to campus for publicized seminars
    and one-on-one sessions, 5) developing a network of female entrepreneurs for support,
    feedback and social connections, and 6) instituting an entrepreneurial leave of

- abstractText: "Intellectual Merit:\nThis project, from Brigham Young University,
    creates an I-Corps Site.\n\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded
    entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple,
    local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites
    provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training
    and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \n\nA typical I-Corps Site is funded
    for approximately $100,000 per year for up to three years. The Site funding is
    used to by academic institutions to catalyze teams (with amounts ranging from
    $1,000 to $3,000) whose technology concepts are likely candidates for commercialization.
    The make-up of teams at the Sites is modeled after the composition of I-Corps
    Teams, and education at the Sites shares the principles of the I-Corps Curriculum.
    With the support and mentorship of the Sites, the teams will learn first-hand
    about entrepreneurship and explore the transition of their ideas, devices, processes
    or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.\n\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen
    innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network
    of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe Brigham Young University
    I-Corps Site serves students and faculty members by providing funds to encourage
    greater technology commercialization activity. Through this project, the BYU I-Corps
    Site brings together and builds on successful programs in three diverse colleges
    and two major entrepreneurial units at BYU: the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Technology (CET), and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO). The CET primarily
    addresses student entrepreneurship and the TTO primarily addresses faculty technology
    commercialization needs. \n\nBy providing specifically targeted commercialization
    funds, this I-Corps Site program builds bridges that attract and stimulate both
    faculty and student entrepreneurial activity. Approximately 30 teams each year
    receive I-Corps funds to explore technology commercialization opportunities at
    BYU. Expected outcomes include  (1) formation of startup ventures with students
    as major players, (2) creation of scaling plans suitable for presentation to seed-stage
    investors, (3) increased participation by BYU students in the commercialization
    of faculty-generated IP, and (4) increased participation of women and underrepresented
    participants in BYU student entrepreneurship activities.  \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThis
    program advances knowledge by studying best practices in university-centered technology
    commercialization processes, learning how to better incentivize students and faculty
    at BYU to participate in these processes, and tracking weaknesses in student teams
    to learn how best to blend student energy and creativity with faculty expertise
    and external mentoring. By engaging student teams in the technology commercialization
    process, so they build scalable new ventures, this program will directly create
    greater economic activity, particularly in the inter-mountain west region of the
    USA. This will result in increased job creation along with the other normal outcomes
    of increased economic activity. \n\nThis program will also reach out to women
    and underrepresented participants, thus increasing the diversity of students involved
    in entrepreneurial activities within the BYU ecosystem. As an I-Corps Site, the
    CET's synergistic activity of holding the annual International Business Model
    Competition will gain greater visibility and thus promote the overall goals of
    the I-Corps programs to inculcate customer development and related lean launch
    principles in young entrepreneurs across the country."

    The Penn Site will employ a structured process for business model validation following
    the Lean Launchpad methodology. Within the context of technologies arising from
    STEM research at Penn, the goals of the Site are to expand PCI?s start-up creation
    services to teams involving faculty and students, provide hands-on experiential
    entrepreneurial education, and accelerate startup-creation at Penn. This project
    will provide a commercialization path for Penn?s educational entrepreneurial activities
    in STEM by expanding PCI?s company formation for faculty/student teams in STEM
    and by adding an entrepreneurial component to PCI?s educational programs.  \n\nBroader
    Impacts:\nA direct result of the PCI-ICS will be hands-on training in the Customer
    Discover Methodology (Blank, 2012) of 90+ faculty and students, creation of business
    plans and pitches suitable to present to partners and investors, the creation
    of new start-ups and, when appropriate, licensing of technologies originating
    from Penn research.  The ultimate goal is to help transition of research to commercialization,
    while integrating education and traditional technology transfer activities by
    promoting a hands-on experiential approach to development of startup ideas. This
    will be accomplished by establishing a framework that acts as a bridge between
    educational coursework and PCI?s company formation programs.  \n\nThe PCI Site
    will help spawn faculty and students trained in fundamental aspects of entrepreneurism.
    A collaboration with the Wharton-SBDC will have the dual impact of providing business
    guidance to entrepreneurs in STEM and exposing business students to STEM areas
    of research. By connecting Penn nascent entrepreneurs with the PCI?s network of
    entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors as well as with the Ben Franklin Technology
    Partners Southeastern Pennsylvania Economic Development Agency and the Mayor of
    the City of Philadelphia, the Penn I-Corps site may be an important contributor
    to the development of dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem in the region."

    This project establishes an I-Corps Node that is focused on promoting innovation in the Southwest region of the United States (the Southwest Alliance for Entrepreneurial Innovation Node - "SAEIN"). SAEIN efforts will leverage the combined entrepreneurial experience and extensive research capabilities of three lead research institutions: The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), Texas A&M University (TAMU), and Rice University (Rice). Geographically, SAEIN will serve an area of more than 268,000 square miles and help foster the implementation of I-Corps methodologies across a collaborative group of more than 30 institutions of higher learning. SAEIN will specifically engage numerous Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to implement the I-Corps curriculum and methods as both a standard for entrepreneurial training and a mechanism to broaden participation in STEM fields. SAEIN has the potential to introduce NSF I-Corps curriculum to more than 710,000 community college students and almost 4.8 million K-12 students in the state.

    SAEIN will engage the use of I-Corps methodology throughout entrepreneurship-focused entities and events, including regional academic incubators, the Small Business Development Centers, high profile business plan competitions, and the international South by Southwest (SXSW) event. SAEIN will augment the NIN capabilities by building on the unique economic strengths, labor characteristics, lean manufacturing capabilities, and the innovation ecosystem found in the Southwest region. The Node will generate tremendous exposure for the I-Corps program nationwide and provide a unique platform for innovation promotion and venture development.

    SAEIN engages a strong alliance of institutions that are already connected by a large volume of NSF-supported research projects. It seeks to advance economic growth goals for the region and nation through a variety of programs and activities that employ the business model canvas and team-based discovery practice to best understand the intellectual property resulting from these projects. SAEIN will study the deployment of I-Corps methodologies into regional community college systems and investigate ways to increase STEM participation and 4-year transfer rates from community colleges through the application of I-Corps. Specific Level 3 research thrusts will explore: 1) Lean LaunchPad research that is targeted at vetting the impact of pivots and customer discovery on entrepreneurial success and scientific outcomes; 2) development of a STEM research canvas model that is focused on producing suitable STEM learning sets focused on K-12 STEM learners (consistent with the Business Model Canvas and I-Corps methodologies); and 3) I-Corps Team Modeling and Development, with a focus on exploring the effectiveness of new teaming models around I-Corps methodologies from different populations (i.e., community colleges, K-12, additional external groups).

    has traditionally benefited from industries in support of agriculture, forestry
    and fishing. Textile manufacturing played a vital role in the economy but overseas
    labor drew away many of these jobs. Many of ECU's students find a lack of available
    jobs in their home towns once they graduate with newly acquired skills so they
    leave home to find jobs elsewhere. For these reasons, much of ENC has faced declining

    Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities
    whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their
    technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice,
    resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups
    to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.
    This is a Type II proposal, requesting a \"renewal\" of funding for an existing
    I-Corps Site. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals. Type I proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request $100,000 per year for up to five years. Type II proposals
    are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site.
    These proposals may request up to $100,000 per year for up to three years.\n\nThrough
    their initial Site grant, the University of Chicago served approximately 90 STEM
    teams, including innovative faculty, researchers, and students from the University
    of Chicago community and other Chicagoland institutions. Several of these teams
    were successful ? winning further grant funding, raising outside capital, hiring
    staff, and launching companies. Upon the renewal of their Site grant, the Polsky
    Center seeks to: 1) continue serving campus constituents, and 2) broadening access
    of these resources to underserved and underrepresented populations in the Chicagoland
    region whose universities do not currently provide access to Site resources. Through
    this goal, Polsky aims to increase economic development in Illinois and empower
    innovators to test their ideas.\n\nThe Polsky Center has been a recognized leader
    in the development and launch of ventures that create economic value, supporting
    an increasing number of companies launching from technical divisions, including:
    the Computation Institute, the Medical Center, and the Institute for Molecular
    Engineering. Additionally, the University of Chicago manages national laboratories,
    including the Department of Energy Labs Argonne and Fermi, as well as the Marine
    Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. The University of Chicago is committed to
    also supporting technology transfer from these institutions, which have received
    federal funding."

    Startup Factory Building. \n\nExpectations are that the ISU Site is energizing
    solutions to grand challenges - such as food production to serve a growing global
    population - that require innovative thinking and creativity in agriculture, engineering
    and other disciplines. ISU, a land grant institution steeped in traditions of
    agriculture, contributes a record of entrepreneurial contributions reflecting
    its strengths in engineering, bio-renewables, materials science and agriculture.
    In the long term, the I-Corps site will generate a new body of academics, holistically
    trained as scientists-technologists-entrepreneurs, equipped with knowledge and
    skills to galvanize transformative new solutions to vexing agricultural and other
    global problems that will ensure the robustness and sustainability of the food
    and energy supply chain. Association with other agricultural and engineering schools
    in the Midwest enhances the knowledge base and creates a virtual network of innovators
    and entrepreneurs driving the economy of the entire Midwest region. \n\nThrough
    partnership with the Iowa Economic Development Authority (IEDA), the Iowa Innovation
    Council and the Iowa Innovation Corporation (I-ICorp), novice entrepreneurs from
    the ISU innovation ecosystem connect with the broader network of venture capitalists
    and business leaders in the state; through practical experiential learning modules,
    cohorts collaborate with a diversity of successful real-world entrepreneurial
    businesses (bioscience, information technology, bioenergy etc.) in the Research
    Park as well as the more mature companies (Pioneer-DuPont, Monsanto and John Deere)
    that drive the economic engine of the state; and, the Site training program incorporates
    respect for and inclusiveness of all forms of diversity in the innovation economy."

Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.

    The George Washington University Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OI&E) collaborates with multiple units on campus to dramatically increase student and faculty teams from the STEM disciplines in OI&E innovation and commercialization activities. There is a strong network of mentors who are key in this process. OI&E developed multiple versions of the Lean Startup curriculum and will continue to do so to meet the special needs of undergraduate students, women, minorities, and veterans in the STEM disciplines. OI&E is also creating courseware in support of experienced entrepreneurs, investors, and business professionals who have not yet learned to apply lean startup methods. Doing so brings value to an entire startup ecosystem that is important to startup success. The broader impacts include spreading entrepreneurial thinking among the faculty, developing a well-trained cadre of mentors and adding to the diversity of the pool of mentors, especially women and veterans. These are important goals in entrepreneurship and commercialization and the project is specific about how this Site will advance these broader impacts.

    teams, but also by helping create a faculty and student population that is familiar
    with the business startup process. It also provides a pathway for underrepresented
    students to participate in STEM-related business startups. \n\nThe Site grant
    provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along
    with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and
    technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long
    after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. \n\nThe OSU I-Corp Site impact
    includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs
    in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups
    to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for
    Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers.
    An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves
    the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their
    competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation."

    advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable
    groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps
    Team applicants. II-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally
    and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs
    and investors. \n\nThe site at USF institutionalizes the Lean LaunchPad training
    process at the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) and transforms processes in its
    Technology Transfer Office (TTO) to facilitate faculty and students to transfer
    STEM research into commercially viable ideas and prototypes. Faculty and students
    are recruited for this Site using pro-active processes such as: visits to classrooms,
    capstone design courses, research projects on campus, undergraduate and graduate
    research displays, individual contacts with faculty with STEM related research
    grants, and invention disclosures. The TTO also helps teams connect with business
    mentors by leveraging current contacts. They also are a resource for finding non-NSF
    funds for innovation-related activities. Faculty from CFE, representing the Colleges
    of Business, Engineering, Medicine and Sustainability, deliver the NSF training
    program in a one-week, intensive boot camp format. \n\nBeyond the prototype stage,
    USF CONNECT, which is the business arm of USF and at the epicenter of Tampa Bay's
    innovation ecosystem, supports the I-Corps teams throughout the business life
    cycle, providing facilities, partners, and resources for business development
    and access to technologies, workforce programs, technology commercialization,
    critical research equipment, and incubator facilities. The I-Corps program results
    in an institutional impact by addressing a crucial gap in the USF innovation ecology
    in creating prototypes and enhancing design. \n\nWith an I-Corps site, the potential
    for increasing STEM technology transfer that feeds Tampa Bay's growing innovation
    ecosystem is high and contributes to transforming the region through high-technology
    startups. USF is an economic anchor for the Tampa Bay region and a node of the
    Florida High Tech Corridor that spans a 23-county region in Florida. Most of the
    state's medical device manufacturing, defense, aerospace, informational technology,
    and life sciences companies reside in this region. \n\nUSF's diverse student population
    are also targeted in the I-Corps Sites program. NSF/USF supports the Bridge to
    the Doctorate and Sloan Minority PhD programs that have enabled USF to be ranked
    as a top-10 producer of minority (African American/Black, Hispanic/Latino) engineering
    doctorates. The I-Corps site also nurtures innovation among students who are military
    veterans, as more than 2,100 veterans and their families are enrolled as students
    at USF."

    I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute
    to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and
    investors.\n\nStony Brook developed a suite of programs for providing science
    and engineering-based assistance to companies with technology needs. This suite
    of programs has been successful in fostering the growth of enterprises, including
    startups. The Stony Brook campus leads SUNY in technology transfer performance
    - invention disclosures, patent applications, issued patents, and executed licenses.
    Its economic development/ industry assistance programs, which assists companies
    of any size at any stage of development, has a track record of promoting company
    growth - more than 3,500 projects, completed with more than 800 companies, have
    generated more than $900 million in corporate revenues. The oldest and largest
    Stony Brook incubator has exited some 80 companies with a 55% success record.\n\nThe
    Stony Brook I-Corps Site will capitalize on the prospective talent within its
    own faculty and student body and the discovery and innovation generated by sponsored
    investments in its research programs. Stony Brook's Site will collaborate with
    the University's academic leadership to focus assets on discovering and nurturing
    a new target, the entrepreneur, and structuring access to assets -  including
    the Long Island REACH Hub - to maximize innovation impact and create a permanent,
    sustainable entrepreneurial pipeline as both beneficiary of and stimulus for a
    larger innovation network.  \n\nAs a region of 2.8M people with a $143B Gross
    Metropolitan Product (2012), Stony Brook's location, Long Island, is larger than
    19 states and a net contributor to New York's fiscal health. Its growth rate,
    however, has lagged the nation since 2010. Strengthening the regional innovation
    ecosystem may have long-term positive economic impacts across the state. Within
    the ecosystem itself, the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will not only transform the
    culture of the Stony Brook campus, creating a permanent vehicle to feed the new
    venture pipeline, which will be strengthened by a synergistic relationship with
    the proposed Long Island REACH Hub, but it will also broaden the impact of the
    established NYCRIN I-Corps Node, in which Stony Brook is a partner, by feeding
    it close to an additional 100 entrepreneurial teams over a three-year period.
    Regionally, the design of the Stony Brook I-Corps Site will extend the Site's
    impact by inviting entrepreneurial researchers from the region's other research
    institutions to participate."

    may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development,
    manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate
    the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components
    and dedicated resources for prototyping. \n\nOSUAA works across all 11 university
    colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world,
    experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in three aspects: through a systematic customer discovery process, it enhances the R&D community's understanding of the potentially broad needs and application spaces of the contact-less physiological monitoring. For the robust heart-rate tracking technologies that this I-Corps project is based on, the potential commercial impact includes monitoring drivers' conditions to enhance driving safety, supporting safe and effective athletic/fitness training, offering additional analytics from surveillance video for public safety, and more. The outcome of the I-Corps customer discovery will provide real-world requirements and data to a new round of R&D and enhance the R&D community's scientific and technological understanding.  The I-Corps training and experience will prepare the Team to identify and pave a way to the most effective customer-technology path for commercialization, which will lead to an economic and societal impact.  The training would also provide valuable insights to the Technical Lead and Co-Lead, who as faculty members can potentially incorporate the Lean Startup and entrepreneurial thinking into their future education and mentoring activities. This would extend the benefits to many students in the years to come.

    This I-Corps project builds on the research advances of contact-free sensings, such as through video, to capture the very small color changes of a person's face as his/her heart pumps blood to reach the whole body.  The team has developed a strong expertise to harvest such micro signals under a number of scenarios and motivating applications. From the patent-pending research on which this I-Corps project is based, accurate heart rate detection and tracking have been achieved even under significant motion as users move and lighting conditions change, which is common in real-world use.  The synergy of multiple traditionally separate fields, including image/video processing, computer vision, statistical signal processing and estimation, paved a foundation to address the R&D challenges.  The methodologies learned from the I-Corps program serve as a bridge between the theory and practice of micro signal analytics in the important emerging area of health analytics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is revolutionizing how farmers grow their crops and significantly reduced the dependence on fertilizers or pesticides to maximize yields. Understanding how to manipulate natural components of the plant stress response to provide desirable beneficial traits will potentially lead to reductions in chemical use in agriculture.  This technology provides a novel mechanism to express broad spectrum immune response that would normally stunt plant growth. This novel mechanism has large potential societal and commercial impacts. Currently, agricultural companies express resistance genes using promoter systems that are specific for one strain of pathogen. Each resistance gene included in the plant seed results in a negative fitness cost. The technology developed here can potentially eliminate the need to express multiple resistance genes by replacing them with one broad spectrum resistance gene.

    This I-Corps project further develops a TBF1-Control Cassette technology (TCC) to regulate translation that is both inducible and specific. Current gene expression methods are primarily based on transcriptional regulation utilizing synthetic or native promoters, which were shown to be insufficient in overcoming negative fitness costs associated with expression of stress response genes. The TCC technology remediates these negative fitness cost by "stalling" the translation of the gene of interest until a trigger is present. This mechanism allows for the accumulation of transcripts without the subsequent translation, and hence no negative fitness costs until the protein is translated. The technology was proven to work in rice and can be applied to other economically important crops, such as wheat or corn.

    The intellectual merit of this project at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is that the Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures (JHTV) and its accelerator team, FastForward, will support the commercialization of research and technologies to create an innovation ecosystem at the University, and more broadly, in the Baltimore region. This I-Corps Site award enables JHU to leverage research outcomes by providing teams with an essential stipend for customer discovery and prototyping and the ability to validate and test their hypotheses and confirm through customer discovery whether there is value in their technology in the marketplace. By actually getting out of the lab, researchers gain insights into the mindset of decision makers and the payers who may become their customers. This grant will enable the JHU Site to provide a better learning experience for its participants by providing additional, non-dilutive funds.

    For example, in the fall of 2015, JHU's Short Course cohort focused on life sciences and brought together teams from universities across the city. The focused approach allowed instructors to delve into the unique challenges faced by researchers commercializing technology in the life sciences space including the development of strategic partnerships and the need for greater evidence based research at a time when the life science industry is investing less in research and development and easing away from the risks of basic and translational research.

    The I-Corps Site at JHU fills the fundamental educational disconnect between invention and market that is not found inside a lab or classroom but only through customer interviews. The goal of the JHU I-Corps Site will be to advance the knowledge and understanding of the commercial potential of life and basic science research while providing access to the life science expertise of Johns Hopkins to include translation, partnering, and entrepreneurship for the greater National

- abstractText: "This project, from Jackson State University Center for Innovation
    and Entrepreneurship, establishes an I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps)
    Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to
    nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts
    into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking
    opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their
    work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites
    also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National
    Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\n\nThe
    Jackson State University Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (JSU Center)
    strengthens their culture of entrepreneurship by supporting the translation of
    research from lab to market through training for faculty, students, and staff
    in the areas of academic entrepreneurship and innovation. The JSU Site:\n-Offers
    entrepreneurial training and development opportunities for faculty and student
    teams in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines
    to prepare them for participation in the NSF I-Corps Teams Program or for further
    commercialization; \n-Broadens the participation of underrepresented, specifically
    African American, faculty and students in STEM and entrepreneurial training and
    development; and \n-Builds the capacity of faculty and students to explore the
    translation of academic research into tools, products, services, etc. that are
    favorable candidates for commercialization. \nThese objectives are carried out
    through three major activities: \n-Twelve weeks of training for 30 STEM teams
    per year that emphasizes the role of customer discovery and the business model
    canvas in the journey toward commercialization.\n-A year-long series of academic
    entrepreneurship workshops offered to the teams as well as to the campus community\n-An
    end of the year Academic Entrepreneurship Networking and Engagement Session, hosted
    annually in conjunction with Mississippi Innovation Month and Global Entrepreneurship
    Week.\n\nWhile progress has been made in understanding how to support scholars
    in the transition of research and innovations from lab to market, little attention
    has been directed to the ways in which faculty and students at minority serving
    institutions may require different levels of support or engagement to be successful
    in their entrepreneurial efforts. Teaching-loads, service requirements, and limited
    resources may hinder faculty of color at minority serving institutions from venturing
    into entrepreneurship. Lack of exposure to STEM professionals and limited access
    to information regarding entrepreneurship may limit African American students?
    opportunities to participate in research based academic entrepreneurship. Situating
    an I-Corps Site within the JSU institutional contributes to greater understanding
    of the best practices for overcoming the obstacles that hinder people of color
    and women in STEM from participating in innovation and commercialization activities.\n\nThrough
    teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively
    engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up,
    and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship
    Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented
    populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation
    of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing
    to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of
    research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented
    students with STEM faculty and successful entrepreneurs also impacts the community
    by providing important networking, mentorship, and research opportunities - all
    of which are essential parts of recruiting and retaining students and promoting
    career advancement for faculty."

    to create Accelerate UConn, an NSF I-Corp Site, to strengthen its existing innovation
    ecosystem with entrepreneurial education, experiential learning and a business
    creation process that is based on the I-Corps model. Accelerate UConn (AU) is
    a joint effort of Technology Acceleration Partners (TAP) ­UConn's technology transfer,
    incubation and commercialization entity -and the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship
    and Innovation (CCEI), which is responsible for much of UConn?s internal and external
    entrepreneurial education activities. \n\nAs an NSF I-Corps site, AU will expand
    UConn's community of innovators and entrepreneurs and will aid in the transformation
    of UConn discoveries into products that benefit humanity and add to economic growth.
    \n\nBroader Impacts:\nThe proposed activity may significantly impact the preparedness
    of university talent for roles in technology-based, entrepreneurial enterprises
    and, as such, will be a critical ingredient of the economic success of Connecticut
    and the nation. Connecticut has historically relied on well-established companies
    to support its economy, resulting in a dearth of entrepreneurial talent that has
    lead to a loss of innovative capacity. AU's activities will support the shift
    from dependence on large corporate employers to an entrepreneurially driven economy.
    As more startups begin to flourish as a result of AU's efforts, new jobs will
    be created and the career prospects of  graduates will be strengthened. \n\nOn
    the national level, there is valid concern that losing our standing as the global
    leader in technology will result in economic contraction. AU?s activities may
    counter this trend by teaching university researchers to think beyond traditional
    academic boundaries, thus enabling this group of individuals to remain in science
    by becoming drivers of innovation within technology-based, entrepreneurial companies,
    which they help to create."

    Impacts:\nThe direct impact is to educate the UA community in technology commercialization,
    transition teams to becoming NSF I-Corps trained teams and form start-up companies.
    The potential long term impact is to provide them with the education and skills
    that will position them to become part of the knowledgeable, creative workforce
    that will help the US maintain leadership in critical areas of science, technology,
    engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  The University of Alabama Site provides
    a formal structure to nurture entrepreneurial teams and guide the output of scientific
    discoveries closer to the development of technologies, products, and processes
    that benefit society. AIME has consistently recruited underrepresented STEM students
    and the Site will leverage the university's STEM Path to the MBA program and will
    encourage and advance minority participation in STEM-based entrepreneurial activities.
    In addition to impacting the university community, this Site program will enhance
    networking and partnerships through the involvement of AIME's mentors, who provide
    a network in their specific industries. Through providing a database of contacts,
    providing interaction with experts and providing top notch seminars, the University
    of Alabama Site has the opportunity to increase public participation in STEM activities
    by providing modest funds for prototypes and exploration into product-market fit,
    which increases the chance of commercial success. The University of Alabama Site

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the Southwest I-Corps Node (SWICORPS) project will derive from its extensive reach and its carefully structured programming and research.  SWICORPS is the largest Node in the program, covering five states from Oklahoma to the Texas-Mexico border (over 800 miles), and from New Mexico to Louisiana (over 1,000 miles). SWICORPS includes four Research 1 level institutions and will leverage its access to almost 500 degree-granting institutions to build entrepreneurship capacity in the region. SWICORPS will introduce faculty and students throughout the region to the I-Corps entrepreneurial curricula, ultimately increasing the economic impact of their research. The activities of the node will build a cadre of STEM researchers and students with an entrepreneurial mindset and appropriate training to exploit their research discoveries in the marketplace. With nearly half a million students enrolled in Minority Serving Institutions in Texas alone, SWICORPS will focus efforts and outreach to the regions most underserved areas to grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

    This I-Corps Node project provides training and infrastructure to share the Lean Launchpad I-Corps curriculum with affiliates across a vast and diverse region. It will continue to expand to reach new trainers and impact early-stage startups, including those from Sites located in the region. These activities will help to build a regional critical mass of technology-based companies. The I-Corps Node will raise awareness of the value of entrepreneurship and business skills among science and engineering faculty, researchers, and students through its customized regional programs and outreach initiatives. This Node will build on best practices to develop an effective mentor network and aid teams in identification of mentors for national program training. The partner schools will contribute to the National Innovation Network for the development of new curricula and advanced tools. The node will exploit metrics and outcomes from its regional activities to better understand the entrepreneurial mindset, and to determine which tools best serve entrepreneurs during and after the customer discovery process. Southwest I-Corps Node's recruitment of strong national teams will continue to increase the impact of federally funded research, and will contribute to innovation, job creation, and economic growth, both in the region and throughout the country.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps Project is to conduct customer discovery interviews to identify initial customers that can support a universal medication autoinjector platform technology that can democratize accessibility to medications.  A direct ampule autoinjector system can leverage the existing global medical infrastructure of the ampule-based medication cartridge while expanding accessibility of medications.  From a cost effectiveness and cost minimization perspective, an equally safe and efficacious drug delivery platform technology will require complex advancements in the scientific and technological understanding of injection systems that can deliver a consistent dose of medication free of particulate contamination, air bubbles, and is also user intuitive with little to no technical training.  The potential societal impact of this technology can save many lives since having wider access to this technology can prevent death or disability that can arise if patients undergoing medical situations are not treated quickly.  This platform technology can also protect emergency responders, civilians and military personnel exposed to biological or chemical threats.  The potential commercial impact of the project can disrupt the multi-billion-dollar health care market, democratize health care access, while being capable of expanding into global markets.

    This I-Corps project will further the development and commercialization of direct ampule-based autoinjector technology through customer discovery.  Technical results of the feasibility of the technology under development have been proven through the development of a proof of concept that can consistently deliver a volume of medication.  These results have been further refined to the publication of a patent undergoing review.  The NSF sponsored customer discovery program will help the team develop the framework for conducting customer discovery interviews in a structured format while incorporating interview responses and data into a commercialization strategy for product to market execution.  The intellectual merits of the proposed activity will help the team identify how current needs are being addressed regarding the administration of medications while more importantly identifying if those needs are truly met and or if there are other needs that can be met which currently are not met.  The I-Corps customer discovery training program can help the project team identify stakeholders, key opinion leaders and develop a customer segmentation profile that can more accurately identify actual customers and payers in the health care medical device ecosystem while seeking avenues for collaboration in the healthcare industry.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable personalized monitoring of sudden cardiac events and heart arrhythmia by combining a wearable device and cloud computing. The project will utilize a patented cloud-connected ring sensor for long-term on-demand Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Current ECG monitoring is a $4 billion dollar market. However no existing product can provide on-demand multi-lead ECG signals over long periods (over one month). Every year over 380,000 Americans die from heart attacks, of which one third happen outside a hospital, motivating a solution to a personalized cardiac monitoring device which can provide actionable diagnosis on-demand and is connected with physicians for quick intervention. This project will potentially enable a first-in-kind ring ECG sensor to serve this unmet need. This I-Corps project will support extensive customer discovery with cardiac patients, healthcare workers, cardiologists, nurses, and telemedicine companies.  In addition, through the NSF I-Corps Team program, two engineering doctoral students will learn important entrepreneurial skills such as the lean start-up model, go through an intensive and rigorous customer discovery process, and network with potential investors and partners.

    This I-Corps project integrates wearable devices with cloud computing to enable personalized cardiac monitoring on-demand. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the innovation of flexible electronics based miniature ECG sensors and cloud-based informatics system. By integrating wearable ECG sensors and cloud computing, on-demand cardiac monitoring information can be shared with cardiologists and emergency physicians. A smartphone can be used to receive physician-suggested actions for early intervention. During this I-Corps project, the team will explore the market potential for cloud-based wearable biosensors at point-of-care settings for cardiac applications where long term on-demand monitoring is important. The project will involve an extensive customer discovery process with potential stakeholders, business model generation and potential partner identification.   More broadly, this platform technology is also applicable to other wearable devices and chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, depression and dementia.

    Intellectual Merit:
    The United States faces significant challenges in rapidly and efficiently bringing emerging science and engineering innovations to use in industry and commerce. To maintain our world leadership in scientific and engineering research and education, we need processes that enable the practical and scalable application of promising discoveries from research and university laboratories. For university research to achieve greater impact, academic researchers and their students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) need tools and preparation for evaluating whether research discoveries can be readily translated into practical applications and eventual commercialization. For these reasons, NSF established the I-Corps training program in 2011 to support NSF-funded researchers in learning how to evaluate their scientific research for commercial potential. The National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance, Inc., d/b/a VentureWell, proposes to continue its work with NSF to plan, implement and evaluate five (5) additional I-Corps workshops (National Team Trainings) and two (2) National Faculty Training events.

    Broader Impacts:
    The I-Corps program provides NSF-funded principal investigators and their team members with funding
    and training enabling them to evaluate their technologies and research discoveries for commercial
    feasibility. The ultimate goal of the program is to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF
    research funding directly, through commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists
    and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the
    development of a product or technology. By the end of the program, I-Corps grantees are expected to
    reach a decision about the commercial readiness of their technology or product and take with them a set
    of skills that they can continue to apply in their research careers. Program participants evaluate and
    translate their research into applications that have commercial potential and can benefit society. Many
    participants will have identified promising commercial pathways that can lead to new high tech ventures
    or licensing opportunities. Since the program's inception, I-Corps teams have formed 350 companies that
    have attracted over $83 million in follow-on investment and grants. These companies operate in a broad
    range of sectors including health, energy, materials, agriculture and information technology and are
    geographically distributed across 43 states.

    (CIE), is to implement a systematic and replicable agile startup methodology,
    focused on customer discovery and product adaptation. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    leverages Carnegie Mellon's strengths and past successes in fusing technology
    with entrepreneurship. Their Site utilizes CMU's network of internal and external
    contacts to train entrepreneurial faculty and student teams working in STEM fields.
    CMU's curricular model is based on the i6 Agile Innovation System and is consistent
    with the I-Corps Curriculum. It includes four elements: workshops, mentoring,
    funding for projects and customer discovery, and incubator space.\n\nThe objectives
    of the CMU Site are to: \n1) capitalize on CMU's culture of innovation by expanding
    programs to nurture entrepreneurial ventures and transition university research
    to the market; \n2) train individuals to understand basic motivations, processes,
    practices, and challenges of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n3) hone individuals'
    entrepreneurial practices and skills; \n4) collaborate with industry, entrepreneurs,
    and the business community in the region and nation. \n\nThe CMU program will
    recruit teams from: existing entrepreneurial activities, course projects, college
    liaisons, and an open call. Underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged
    to apply. Teams will be encouraged to avail themselves of enrichment opportunities
    such as funding avenues, venture competitions, and business events. Each team
    will have an Entrepreneurial Lead, an Academic Lead, and a Mentor.  \n\nThe assessment
    plan focuses on ascertaining the most effective components of an agile university
    entrepreneurship training program. Teams' milestones and customer contacts will
    be tracked. Formative assessment using tools such as pre-, mid-, and post-program
    surveys will inform the CMU program evolution.\n\nOf particular merit is this
    proposed Site's agile and adaptable customer-based training program, components
    of which have been shown to be successful in programs such as the i6 Agile Innovation
    System and the I-Corps Curriculum/Lean Launch Pad. Combining these components
    -- and then distilling through assessment and evaluation which of them are especially
    effective at spurring creativity, resourcefulness, independence, and connectivity
    -- will further entrepreneurial knowledge and education. The program will also
    teach entrepreneurial students and faculty how to create their own ecosystem by
    engaging in customer discovery and network building. \n\nThe CMU I-Corps Site
    plans to move university research out of the lab more efficiently and effectively.
    Expediting the movement of academic innovation to the commercial sector allows
    new, often government-funded, university discoveries and inventions to reach the
    public sector earlier spawning new endeavors and economic growth. All sectors
    of society and areas of inquiry -- healthcare, energy, sustainability, global
    communication, for example, can see benefits. In addition, making earlier decisions
    about viability of commercial outcomes is beneficial as it can more effectively
    utilize critical resources --time, energy, talent, and funds. In addition, a successful
    Site will likely impact the Pittsburgh, Steel Valley, and Allegheny Valley communities."

- abstractText: "This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students
    and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned
    into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources,
    networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition
    their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace
    or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.\n\nWith this project, the von Liebig
    Center at UC San Diego (vLC) will become an NSF I-Corps Site to further catalyze
    the commercialization of university discoveries by extending its services to an
    untapped population of graduate students, researchers and faculty early-stage
    discoveries with the expectations that vLC will:\n\n- Build a larger and more
    robust pipeline of viable student team projects that can be translated into the
    marketplace from earlier stages of research discoveries.\n- Increase awareness
    and participation in technology commercialization among the broader UCSD research
    and student community, in particular among females and underrepresented minorities.
    \n- Provide real world experiential learning to the student teams participating
    in the process while facilitating access to the region?s innovation ecosystem
    and entrepreneurial support network. \n- Expand the suite of offerings that the
    von Liebig Center can provide to students and faculty for its services to the
    earlier stages of technology translation. \n- Collaborate on ?best-practices?
    by becoming a member of an I-Corps Site network that shares insights with a wide
    community of similar centers in the Nation.  \n\nThese goals will be accomplished
    through entrepreneurship curricula, identification, selection, and intervention
    activities, mentoring, and assignment of resources for early stage development
    - all of which contribute to the academic research translation process through
    the creation of an integrated, experiential, educational program that focuses
    on the training of academic innovators while they are still engaged in the early
    stages of the discovery process. \n\nThe vLC has solid processes in place for
    recruiting, vetting, and supporting teams through their I-Corps Site. They have
    many noteworthy examples of startups they have supported through their existing
    center and strong connections with the community, business and industry, and the
    state of California. \n\nBroader Impact:\n\nThe vLC I-Corps SIte will strengthen
    and broaden the pipeline of innovations from the university while promoting entrepreneurial
    thinking and activities to thrive in the academic environment. \n\nBy encouraging
    student and faculty/researcher participation actively translating research to
    early stage development, new products or services will be launched resulting in
    the creation of high value jobs and economic growth in the region. \n\nEntrepreneurial
    students from underrepresented groups will have a support network inside the university
    that will give them the confidence needed to thrive and participate in the process.
    \n\nOutcomes will be widely disseminated by becoming a member of the NSF I-Corps
    Site network, thus catalyzing innovation in technology discoveries. The most important
    impact of this proposed approach is building entrepreneurial principles, early-stage
    commercialization pipelines, and early-stage incubation schemas. These practices,
    when proven successful in this approach, can be integrated or replicated to other
    universities around the country."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project,
    entailing a technology based on chaotic system variability, is its ability to
    alter and enhance how people interact with music on and off line. By acting as
    a musical change agent, the proposed technology takes \"personalized music\" beyond
    playlists and song suggestions. For the first time, music listeners can bring
    their own creativity to the songs they care about. This project introduces a new
    paradigm for music where songs evolve and undergo transformation alone or with
    other songs, at the click of a button. The choice of music as an application for
    the technology is deliberate. Music is a highly context-dependent application
    where each note or musical event is determined by the preceding notes and events,
    and each note or event foreshadows those yet to come. That this advanced technique
    produces musical variations that can be analyzed as well as used for musical means
    suggest that the methodology could be applied to other sequences of context-dependent
    symbols, such as those that define image, text, film, and video. Furthermore,
    it can serve as an idea generator for media practitioners in general, as well
    as stimulate interest in engineering for students K-12 and beyond by linking science
    with the musical arts. \n\nThis I-Corps project harnesses chaotic system variability
    to generate variations of a sequence of context-dependent symbols, such those
    that constitute a musical work. Most engineers seek ways to eliminate chaotic
    behavior. Yet in its \"chaotic regime\", a dissipative chaotic system possesses
    a natural mechanism for variability due to the sensitivity of its solutions to
    initial conditions. This built-in variability can be exploited by a chaotic mapping
    technique that transforms an ordered input into a variant ordered output. The
    variant output can be close to the original work, it can mutate beyond recognition,
    as well as achieve degrees of variability in between these two extremes. The method
    includes parsing the input into an ordered sequence of original elements {Ni},
    the original elements sequentially indexed by successive integer values i=1,....,imax.
    For each \"i\", a selection algorithm determines whether Ni is a candidate for
    modification or replacement, thus becoming a \"receptor element\". A substitution
    or modifying algorithm then operates on at least one of the receptor elements
    by varying or replacing it with a substitution element. The resulting ordered
    set of original and substituted or modified elements comprises the variant output.
    A virtually infinite set of variations is possible, each unique.\n\nThis award
    reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves improvement in the standard of care for patients suffering from retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Vision loss or decline imposes a significant socio-economic burden on populations afflicted by these debilitating diseases. The proposed product aims to reduce the frequency of intraocular drug injections for treating these conditions, which may lead to improved patient compliance. Commercially, the product may replace current therapeutic approaches based on antibody technologies. The customer discovery and preparation of a business model canvas through the I-Corps program will determine a clear go/no-go decision for clinical translation of the product. Success of the business strategy may increase the well-being of millions of Americans suffering from diabetic retinopathy. The translation of the technology from the bench to the bedside would pave the way for market approval of peptide-based hydrogels in particular and implantable biomaterials in general.

    This I-Corps project would enable customer discovery and preparation of a business model canvas for the development of an anti-angiogenic hydrogel intended for the treatment of intraocular posterior segment diseases. The current standard-of-care, intraocular injections of inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor, cause patient discomfort and increased risk of infection due to the high frequency of dosage (monthly) required. The proposed product is a shear-responsive hydrogel, and thus it can be injected into the vitreous humor of the eye. The constituent peptide contains an anti-angiogenic domain and self-assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular nanofibers. The biological activity as well as the favorable material property of the product has led to the current I-Corps proposal. The proposed product may enhance technological understanding of the response of intraocular neovascularization to injectable anti-angiogenic hydrogels, facilitating future therapies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to provide an easily accessible and reliable national sewer data inventory that will assist municipal utility districts in developing effective and proactive maintenance and rehabilitation plans, hence reducing the overall maintenance costs of sewer systems as well as avoiding costly repairs due to pipe failures. Moreover, if the technology is successfully commercialized, sewer officials such as National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO) will better understand the current and trend of sewer systems condition nation-wide; as such, they will have proven justification to secure adequate federal funding for sewer system improvements. This technology will support the nation's agenda of improving the condition of the aging and deteriorating sewer infrastructure, which will promote societal wellbeing and support the sustainable development of the society. In addition, it has been expected that the availability of national sewer inventory will help the industry to find new uses of sewer data and new collaborations. The participation in the NSF I-Corps program affords graduate students a great opportunity to cultivate their skills in innovation and entrepreneurship, which may lead to the creation of start-up companies and more job opportunities.

    This I-Corps project addresses common concerns -- data availability and data quality -- raised by sewer industry stakeholders. Understanding the current condition and deterioration mechanism of sewer pipe networks is a critical step in improving national wastewater systems, which requires easily accessible and reliable data. Although sewer inspection data have been collected by various utility districts across the country for many years, the data is not in a usable and uniform format for asset management purposes. This technology provides a visual tool to evaluate and report data quality issues and an innovative algorithm to resolve these issues. The preliminary results show that, by applying the proposed quality assurance algorithm to six datasets obtained by the team, the percentage of good quality inspection data increased from 50%-75% (pre-process) to 95% (post-process). More importantly, the proposed technology includes a comprehensive, uniform, and quality-assured national sewer inventory that documents the historical and current conditions of sewer pipelines. Through the regional NSF I-Corps site program, it was concluded that there is a tremendous need for the proposed technology among utilities and contractors because of the time and cost savings that can be realized in inspection processes and rehabilitation plans.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project (NSF Lineage: Award Number 1644664) is borne from the development of a customizable symptom management tool to support women experiencing menopause. The negative perception of menopause causes symptom embarrassment which leads to deficiencies in health literacy and inefficient symptom management.  This project's technology, a wearable-app system, addresses this inefficiency by providing the means to inform and support women throughout menopause. The proposed I-Corps program explores commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of menopause symptom management and also investigates the potential of applications in the cancer symptom management and data sales markets. With respect to the latter, the prospective technology will gather an abundance of data that may be used to streamline biotechnology and pharmaceutical product development. Through adoption of this technology, women will be able to better communicate their symptoms to a more aware and understanding society. This opens the door to future innovations in additional areas of healthcare that are traditionally not openly discussed.

    This I-Corps project is based on the premise that leveraging personal mobile devices and user data may create disruptive innovation in the healthcare space. The project's technology utilizes multiple sensors to collect personalized data which is used to provide the user with multiple ways to optimize management of her menopause symptoms, with the goal of minimizing their negative impact on her daily routine. Progress on the project to date includes development of an alpha prototype that has been used to test the feasibility of both hardware and software components. Current areas of focus include optimization of the physical design and data acquisition capability. The I-Corps process will allow us to improve our understanding of our customers? unmet needs and the ability of our technology to address them. This will guide the development of our technology, including optimization for manufacturing and feature enhancement, to address needs found in customer discovery and accelerate introduction of a useful product to market.

    to satisfy unmet needs of customers. This I-Corps project will provide hands on
    training and experience for an engineering undergraduate student (co-entrepreneurial
    lead) and graduate student (entrepreneurial lead) on the customer discovery process.
    The PI will also gain exposure to the customer discovery process, and will incorporate
    the learnings from this course in ongoing and future projects within his research
    lab and engineering senior design classes. The project activities are intimately
    linked to educational activities that will teach students at various levels about

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project supports improving the efficiency of inventory and warehouse management operations with a cost-affordable technology innovation capable of monitoring goods in real-time without the need for static communications infrastructure. The project promises to enhance such operations through the extraction of information from the collected data and the provision of time-critical insights at a fraction of the costs of current commercial tools. The monitoring innovation will potentially become the first solution in the market capable of continuously monitoring goods in outdoor environments. In addition, the monitoring innovation will potentially become the first cost-affordable monitoring solution for low-value goods. The innovation promises a primary impact in the sectors of defense and construction. In reality, though, it offers the potential to positively impact the cost and efficiency of complex inventory and warehouse management operations across US industry sectors. This I-Corps team will cross-pollinate discovery and innovation across the broad spectrum of implementation scenarios by addressing the existing latent inefficiencies in such operations.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of the real-time monitoring, predictive, and inexpensive innovation in support of inventory and warehouse management operations. A realistic real-time monitoring solution without the need for static communications infrastructure is a technically complex endeavor beyond the capabilities of commercial tracking and monitoring tools. The proposed innovation optimizes operations and information flows, and the response to upstream (push) and downstream (pull) processes and overall system performance. As large datasets are fused the artificial intelligence aspect of the innovation automatically identifies inefficiencies and bottlenecks, and reassesses forecasts and system decisions that account for latest events, data uncertainties, and multiple local optima. This I-Corps team plans to investigate the market potential of the innovation, validate customer needs and how the innovation can alleviate such needs, and discern sustainable business models.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project 'Non-Silane Coupling Agents' rests on the environmental advantage of a new technology platform of coupling agents with potential performance advantages for tire applications. The global tire and rubber companies consume $325 million in silane coupling agents each year. About half of the weight of the silane coupling agents (i.e., ~10 kTon or ~1-5% by weight of the tire) is converted to ethanol and, if not captured, released into the atmosphere as a volatile organic compound (VOC). By replacing the silane moiety in the conventional silane coupling agents with a catechol functional group, the non-silane coupling (NSC) technology completely eliminates the VOC generated during tire manufacture. If other industrial sectors that currently use silanes also adopt the catechol-based technology, ~50 kTon of annual VOC emission will be eliminated. The NSC technology introduces a disruptive replacement for the mature silane-based coupling technology, whose intellectual properties have long expired and whose manufacture is exclusively based in Asia. The NSC technology will also level the playingfield for US rubber and tire manufacturers against their competitors in developing countries, where the environmental regulations are relaxed.

    This I-Corps project 'Non-Silane Coupling Agents' is a clean intellectual departure from the current silane-based technology, taking advantage of the exceptional ability of the catechol motif to form chelation on the surface of silica. The approach is fundamentally novel. The technology is the outcome of a research program sponsored by the NSF I/UCRC Center of Tire Research. The activities encompassed by the I-Corps Teams program will allow us the deep dive necessary to truly understand the customer opportunity, tailor the novel disruptive technology to meet these needs at an early R&D stage and enhances the probability of success. The R&D and business team bring together extensive experience working in the areas of rubber chemistry, technology, marketing, and business management.

  title: 'I-Corps: Non-Silane Coupling Agents'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, based on wireless charging technology, is wide ranging. The expansion of drone applications, use of industrial and multifunctional robots, mobile electronics and sensors and gadgets associated with the internet of things, call for new charging mechanisms for these battery operated devices. The initial market entry point for this project, drone service providers, will not only progress the drone industry but also the industries that drone applications serve.  For agriculture, more effective drone monitoring will increase percent yield of crops as farmers are able to monitor crop growth more effectively.  For search and rescue, remote drone charging stations could help save lives as drones are able to travel further distances.  For oil and gas, drones are already seen as a safer and more cost effective way to monitor fields.  As drone autonomy applications expand, wireless charging technology enabled by this I-Corps project will become essential in package delivery and disaster relief operations as well as a broad range of other industries.  Wireless charging technology will also lower production costs for automated manufacturing and factories adopting industrial internet-of-things sensors and devices.

    This I-Corps project leverages wireless charger technology which is capable of powering devices at distances of a few centimeters to one meter, with an option for charging capability from a few Watts up to a few Kilowatts. Commercially available Qi chargers and near-field non-radiative magnetic induction based wireless chargers result in a rapid degradation of the power transfer efficiency (PTE) with as distance increases. Compared to other magnetic resonance based chargers, the patented technology of this I-Corps project offers less degradation in power efficiency with distance, the ability to charge multiple devices on both sides of the transmitter, and allows for developing thin flexible receivers that can be mounted on planar, singly and doubly curved surfaces. Further, the charger can be tuned in real time for optimum efficiency when the distance between the transmitter and receiver changes. In addition, the possibility of integrating the charger with the drone fuselage eliminates the problems associated with aerodynamic drag which results if a stand-alone charger is mounted on the drone, saves drone "real estate", and reduces the weight of the overall system.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

  title: 'I-Corps: COMMERCIALIZATION OF WIRELESS CHARGER'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on the development of a lower-cost, improved performance infrared radiation detection technology.  Numerous technologies presently exist for detecting Infrared radiation.  Those which are cost effective for commercial applications tend to lack adequate performance specifications, while those with ideal performance are too expensive.  This technology has broad application potential.  The proposed I-Corps program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities within the project's initial application focus of Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) gas sensing of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane and ethylene gas.  These sensors have significant markets related to smart ventilation systems for cars, homes, and businesses, as well as leak monitoring in industrial processes and oil and gas production.  Further enabling the mass deployment of these sensors will have significant impact on energy conservation, environmental protection, and health and safety.  Additionally, longer term development of the technology may prove to be disruptive in thermal imaging applications.  Presently, thermal imaging applications are broad but the hardware is often too cumbersome and expensive to be practical for commercial use.

    This I-Corps project is based on the premise that the intersection of different scientific disciplines leads to disruptive innovation.  The project's technology is a fundamentally different approach to infrared radiation detection than those developed in the past 50+ years.  This project pursues an optical solution to a semiconductor material processing problem which has hampered the realization of adequate production yield, manufacturing scalability, and device performance, resulting in too high a cost and limited suitability for many commercial applications.  Previous progress on this project has focused on the theoretical development of the optical design and experimental verification of these nanofabricated structures.  Initial results have been encouraging, and work continues to enhance responsivity, as well as other necessary device specifications.  This I-Corps process will be used to refine our understanding of customer problems/needs and the potential for our technology to solve them.  This will further inform our technology development path and specification focus, enabling the release of a useful product to market sooner.

  title: I-Corps - A New Technological Approach to Infrared Detection
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to make growing produce more convenient and accessible to a new generation of
    gardeners while enabling student engagement and professional development of the
    team. The project aims to reconnect people with the way that food is grown in
    a way that helps them and the planet. This connection is critical to helping people
    make healthier food choices. By enabling people to grow their own food, we also
    connect them with the reality of seasons and enable them to make choices that
    are better for the environment.  The project will also provide a platform for
    student engagement with entrepreneurship, product development, and engineering
    design. Students are a part of and have shaped smart garden automation from the
    beginning, and the team plans to continue to work with academic institutions to
    maintain this relationship. Finally, the NSF I-Corps program will help this team
    develop the skills necessary to create value from ideas. This learning curve will
    be critical as the team moves forward on this project, and will better prepare
    them to be both leaders and mentors for others in the future. \n\nThis I-Corps
    project is about a smart gardening system that lets gardeners grow more plants
    with less work. By harnessing recent technical advancements in low-power wireless
    communication, moisture sensors, and networked device protocols, the system makes
    gardening more convenient and accessible. When paired with a smart phone or web
    interface, this system has the potential to better enable a generation of gardeners
    and lead to healthier people, more efficient water usage and storm-water management,
    and a lower average carbon footprint for a given person's diet. The intellectual
    merit in this project is demonstrated by the fact that there are no existing systems
    on the market that can do all of things that this project's invention is set to
    do. The NSF I-Corps program will help the project team recognize the market segments
    for any potential commercial product.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

  title: 'I-Corps:  Smart Automation of Garden Monitoring and Maintenance'
- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the elimination or reduction of metrology and post processing analysis that is currently a standard requirement of polymer part manufacturing.  This process improvement that will be facilitated by sensor technology will reduce manufacturing time and cost by 20-40%, improve part quality consistency, and improve molding productivity by 100%. Each percentage point improvement in productivity corresponds to cost savings in excess of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and/or recycling of defective plastic parts.

    This I-Corps project will enable the team to determine the ideal parameters of a multivariate shrinkage sensor for industrial polymer manufacturing.  The insights gained from at least one hundred customer interviews will drive decisions on the commercial potential of a new multi-mode shrinkage monitoring sensor that will obviate the need for manual inspections and enable fully automatic production by directly measuring molded products as they are made, before the mold opens, so that defectives parts can be automatically diagnoses and recycled.  Through I-Corps, the team will assess current sensor design, its relative value compared to existing sensors and inspection procedures in the polymer manufacturing industry, and facilitate identification of customer segments with a critical unmet need for in-mold shrinkage sensor capability. Further, key learning from the I-Corps process will drive refinement of sensor development with the goal of developing a more commercially relevant sensor and provide industrial connections for sensor testing in the future. This overall enhanced knowledge of the industry will additionally reduce commercialization risk should a start-up or licensing opportunity be pursued.

  title: 'I-Corps: Multi-Variate Shrinkage Sensor'
- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses
    on maximizing resources for frost defense, reducing yield loss, improving quality,
    supporting decision-making, and reducing frost management cost for grapes and
    stone fruits.  Cold periods and frost episodes are still one of the worst enemies
    of grape and stone fruit production worldwide.  Grape and orchard production are
    highly linked to climatic conditions, making sub-seasonal weather variability
    and its connections to climate change a challenging issue for this economic sector.
    Growers may presently deploy fossil fuel heaters, sprinkler systems, the downward
    draft from helicopters and wind machines to fight spring frost damage. These methods
    are usually costly, some create environmental concerns, and in many cases they
    may be limited by water availability and area coverage.  Altering timing of bud
    break stages that are susceptible to frost injury appears to be a viable alternative
    to cope with current and emerging challenges of climate change. The proposed I-Corp
    program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of an end-to-end
    solution. The innovation combines a bioactive, non-toxic biodegradable encapsulation
    technology (spray) that alters internal grapevine physiology and promotes bud
    break delay. A predictive analytic system provides recommendations to make informed
    decisions about frost risk management.\n \nThis I-Corps project is based on a
    series of studies that have combined pruning management, biophysical and biochemical
    factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, and resistance to
    cold injury.  In addition, the project combines this knowledge with an analytic
    data platform (software) that will analyze plant development as a function of
    environmental temperature (phenology), topographic and soil data, at the farm
    level.  Combination with global and regional patterns of climate patterns will
    aid understanding climate variability at high spatial and temporal scale. This
    platform will allow better prediction for decision making at the vineyard and
    orchard level to reduce some of the most significant challenges associated with
    prediction reliability about bud break and risk of frost.  Moreover, this predictive
    analytic system will be the foundation for continued innovation in tools and services
    to support decision-making to adapt growing practices, and to preserve sustainability
    due to already observed and worsening climate change impacts.  The I-Corp process
    will also be used to refine our understanding of customer value, willingness to
    pay and the cost of the best current alternatives.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    anode powder which exhibits unusual properties with ultrafast charging capability,
    high specific capacity and long-lasting cycle life. This new Si-based anode is
    termed as Si@void@C because it contains three distinct features simultaneously:
    (i) nanostructured Si building blocks, (ii) a conductive carbon shell outside

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project would be to enable substantial improvements in clinical trial efficiency. Current industry wide average cost to bring a novel medicine through FDA approval has now exceeded $2.6 Billion. The average time for the same is 10 - 15 years.  Typically, industrial customer spends an average of 16,000 to 26,000 US dollars per patient recruited into a phase I, II or III trial, with phase III recruitment costing the highest. With this project's innovative model assisting virtual clinical trials, the cost of recruitment alone can potentially come down significantly as the costs associated with multiple sites setup and monitoring would be eliminated. Each customer will also likely to see significantly reduced dropout during the trials, thereby reducing overall cost and compressing the schedule of the trial.

    This I-Corps project develops a virtual siteless environment for clinical trials. This environment will reduce risks, accelerate trial recruitment using e-consent, aid in conducting multiple virtual follow-up sessions with trial participants without requiring their travel to trial sites. It will also enable collection of data continuously, through participants' wearable devices, web-deployable questionnaires and surveys, home based specimen collection kits or through home visits by a nurse or phlebotomists. This integrated environment for virtual clinical trials will potentially integrate a patient facing application for text, image, video and voice interactions, data hub for integration of clinical, molecular, and digital biomarkers as well as capture of health information.

- abstractText: "This program promotes international multidisciplinary research opportunities
    for U.S. students at the overlap of sustainability, power systems and signal processing
    with the aim of improving efficiency in PV power generation. Algorithms for shading
    prediction and fault optimization will advance the state of the art in remote
    solar array management.  Training students in machine learning, vision and data
    processing for energy systems is unique and requires an integrative approach.
    \ IRES participants will be immersed in producing and understanding solar analytics
    and creating algorithms and software to control solar arrays. The IRES program
    will engage faculty researchers from the Arizona State University SenSIP center
    and from the University of Cyprus KIOS Center in solar energy research. Programs
    and workshops will be established so that IRES participants are trained in machine
    learning for energy systems and present their research results in international
    settings. Weekly presentations at the international site and guidance by international
    mentors will enrich the cohort research experience. Embedding students in the
    KIOS center research labs funded by large European Union (EU) grants will provide
    knowledge on EU and international research practices, energy standards and policies.
    Students will spend six summer weeks at the University of Cyprus KIOS center to
    improve their research skills and elevate their cultural competencies.  This international
    research endeavor will energize students to innovate and disseminate results globally.
    \n\n Solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) arrays encounter loss of efficiency under
    conditions of shading, panel faults and temperature variations.  In fact, shading,
    weather patterns, soiling, and temperature reduce power output considerably. For
    example, a malfunction of one panel will cause an entire PV string to fail.  To
    minimize inefficiencies, individual panel current-voltage (I-V) measurements,
    weather information, and imaging data are essential. Controlling the power output
    is possible through solar panel matrix switching and optimization (i.e., changing
    certain array connections from series to parallel using actuators). Matrix switching
    using programmable relays allows for different interconnection options. The research
    goal is to optimize PV array systems by: a) exploiting the measured I-V patterns
    to detect faults using machine learning, b) employing advanced imaging and vision
    techniques to predict shading, c)  using temperature, irradiance  and weather
    data to elevate PV efficiency, and d) include smart grid interfaces.  This collaborative
    IRES project between Arizona State University and University of Cyprus will engage
    students in the following research problems: a) How do we use imaging to detect
    cloud movement, predict shading and elevate efficiency? b) How can the array connections
    be reconfigured based on imaging, weather, and I-V data to elevate efficiency?
    c) How can we detect and classify panel faults in real time using machine learning
    and other algorithms? d) How do we extend these solar monitoring and control concepts
    from utility-scale solar farms to house rooftop systems?\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    circumvent traditional limits in speed of operation and in energy usage by taming
    the collective response of clouds of electrons in response to excitation - known
    as opto-plasmonic devices (OPD) - resulting in much more sensitive, high speed,

    to become mainstream for general public use in applications such as in affordable
    ultra-high-speed Internet, high-capacity Internet-of-Things (IoT), and energy-saving
    cloud data storage and processing. Notably, this project contributes to the technological
    leadership of the US in the multi-billion dollar global communications markets,
    by generating advanced technical know-how and intellectual property, holding the
    key in manufacturing of new OPDs. Successful completion of this project results
    in a business opportunity for several sustainable jobs for electrical and optical

    for data communication. \n\nThis I-Corps project produces market-ready high-speed
    photodetector technology based on Indium Phosphide material system that are i)
    capable of operation in tele/data communication rates of more than 200 Gbits/sec,
    which is six times faster than state-of-the-art, and ii) compatible with Silicon

    to catalyze the development and commercialization of innovative nanobubble technologies
    in environmental, agricultural and other potential engineering applications. In
    environmental applications, reactive nanobubble technologies could impact water
    or wastewater treatment industries, municipal water treatment plants, drinking
    water disinfection, natural and landscape water management and remediation of
    impaired water bodies (e.g., by algal bloom). Value propositions include the improved
    water treatment efficiency (e.g., increased disinfection efficacy), reduced use
    of traditional hazardous chemicals such as chlorine, and reduced maintenance/operational
    cost in water remediation. In agricultural fields, irrigation with nanobubble
    water can significantly improve dissolved oxygen in water by 100-5000% and efficiently
    deliver oxygenated water and growth elements such as nitrogen to plant roots.
    Thus, the value propositions include improving crop or plant's growth, health
    and quality. Moreover, nanobubble water can positively affect turf and grass business
    and promote reduced or chemical-free fertilization in turf or lawn maintenance
    and therefore increase ecosystem safety and reduce negative environmental impacts.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project explores fundamental engineering principles of colloidal
    bubble systems at nanoscale dimensions. Innovative scientific approaches employ
    reactive nanobubbles to control and mitigate water pollution as well as support
    smart agricultural irrigation/fertilization. Specifically, nanobubble technologies
    are processes that generate ultra-small sizes of bubbles with a diameter of <
    1 um dispersed in water or other liquid media. Nanobubbles in water have a long
    residence time in water due to their low buoyancy and excellent stability against
    coalesces, collapse or burst, and the formation of bulk bubbles. Therefore, compared
    to regular bulk or large bubbles, nanobubbles have a higher efficiency of mass
    transfer due to their high surface areas, which also facilitates physical adsorption
    and chemical reactions in the gas-liquid interface. Therefore, nanobubble technologies
    are potentially useful in many industrial and engineering applications, ranging
    from ultra-sound imaging and intracellular drug delivery, pharmaceutical manufacturing,
    detergent-free surface cleaning, mining separation, water purification to wastewater
    treatment. This I-Corps project focuses on the evaluation of unique business models
    in water pollution control and mitigation as well as irrigation for agricultural

    be significant as it can provide pathways for commercialization of a breakthrough
    research for continuous miniaturization of computer chips. For the digital electronics
    in everyday use, smaller and better chips imply lesser cost, higher performance,
    and more features. As traditional way of IC scaling reaches unsurmountable barriers
    at sub-10nm technology nodes, the proposed technology provides new directions
    for scaling through innovations in several layers from fundamental physical components,
    computing model, to circuits and integration. In addition, the technology promises
    denser, faster and more power efficient computing with unique capabilities for
    fault-tolerant and secure hardware through inherent physical capabilities and

    strategy based fabless commercialization approach is proposed for market penetration
    and growth at a fast turn-around time.  The product will be beneficial for a wide
    range of customers from microprocessor producers to consumer electronics manufacturers

    \n \nThis I-Corps project seeks commercialization potential of a novel computing
    technology that relies on deterministic interference between adjacent nanoscale
    interconnects (Crosstalk) for logic computing. The proposed approach departs from
    current device switching dependent computing paradigm and relaxes difficult device
    scaling requirements. The scalability in Crosstalk fabric is determined primarily
    by circuit scheme, integration and the ability to pattern smaller metal nano-lines
    and deposit dielectrics in between them, which can be done by utilizing existing
    EDA and manufacturing methods. The proposed computing approach is functionally
    complete, and provides huge opportunities for logic reduction; by having more
    than 2 inputs couple to a single output and by varying their respective coupling
    capacitances, a logic implementation (e.g., Carry logic for Addition) that would
    typically require more than 15 transistors in CMOS, can be done by just 5 transistors.
    The benchmarking of a 4-bit adder showed over 5x density benefits vs. CMOS at
    16nm. Another distinct feature of Crosstalk technology is the run-time reconfigurability
    that allows different functionalities to be embedded in the same circuit, which
    can be transformative for fault tolerance (i.e., if a portion of CPU is damaged,
    the functioning portion can be configured to do both tasks), and cybersecurity.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of dried blood for storage at ambient temperatures. Blood transfusions are one of the most common medical procedures in U.S. hospitals and the global market for blood products is over $30 billion. However, red blood cells can only be stored up to six weeks when refrigerated. Red blood cells can be frozen for longer durations using glycerol but the thawing and processing steps are complex and time-consuming. Due to these limitations the blood supply is limited or non-existent in austere environments. Dry preservation of red blood cells at ambient temperatures would enable rapid blood transfusions in austere environments where blood storage is not currently feasible, which would likely save lives in these remote locations. In addition, dried blood is expected to also have an impact on the blood supply for veterinary transfusions. Furthermore, this technology may enable dry preservation of many other cell types for research and medical applications. It is expected that this technology will have a significant impact on human healthcare and will revolutionize civilian and military applications where long-term storage of blood is currently impossible.

    This I-Corps project will provide new insights into potential commercialization opportunities for dried blood. A new method has been developed which utilizes ultrasound and microfluidics technology to load red blood cells with trehalose in order to protect the cell membranes when preserved in a dried state. Results from experimental studies have found that this method yields a significant increase in recovery of viable red blood cells compared to other approaches. The activities of this I-Corps project will aid in identifying or excluding potential areas of market fit for dried blood, including military use, veterinary use, blood banking, hospitals/medical centers, and cell preservation for research applications. Customer discovery interviews will provide new insights into the unmet needs and pain points for providers of blood transfusions and other cell preservation applications.

    that the proposed technology provides a much-needed solution to the current problems
    in electrosurgery that is widely used in many medical specialties such as neurological
    surgery. Electrosurgery is fast and requires short post-surgery recovery time;
    however, major problems such as collateral nerve damage and seal failure still
    exist, sometimes with fatal consequences. The proposed technology helps eliminate
    those problems by monitoring the electrosurgical process with an acoustic signal.
    It will enable an assistive device for surgeons to make precise decisions that
    will ensure the surgical quality. It will reduce surgeon fatigue, time in the
    operating room, and healthcare cost, while improving the overall patient experience.
    This project allows extensive customer discovery and market analysis, from which
    commercial products will be developed to satisfy the needs of patients, surgeons,
    and hospitals. With the projected $5.17B global market for electrosurgical equipment

    The monitoring methodology applied to this project brings advances to the field
    of precision surgery with engineering principles. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses
    on developing a real-time acoustic signal monitoring system for quality assurance
    of the electrosurgical process. First, sound signals captured during the surgery
    is correlated to the water boiling and protein denaturing process in heated tissue.
    Then, a decision-making algorithm is developed based on the signal strength and
    number of bubble bursting events. Previous research on the electrosurgical process
    has provided fundamental understanding and suggested that the acoustic monitoring
    method is dramatically better than existing ones. In the previous study, experiments
    was conducted with ex-vivo porcine tissue and the feasibility of the proposed
    technology using a low-profile sensor was demonstrated. This I-Corps award will

    is to deliver bioactive agents/drugs to ASCs in subcutaneous adipose tissue, inducing
    excessive glucose and fat burn off, thus combating obesity and its related complications
    with high efficacy and minimum side effects.  Our technology can improve human
    health and the quality of life while dramatically reducing medical care costs,
    ultimately lessening the negative societal and economic impact of obesity. In
    addition, a doctoral student will gain intensive and rigorous training and experience
    in innovation and entrepreneurship. \n\nThis I-Corps project will explore the
    market potential of a technology involving the use of ASC-targeted NP-based device
    for the prevention and treatment of obesity with high efficacy and low side effects.
    ASCs are stem cells found in the adipose tissues. ASCs can be differentiated into
    many different types of cells that aid in tissue repair, regenerative medicine,
    obesity and other disease therapy. We aim to induce ASCs differentiation into
    beige adipocytes in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue for combating obesity.
    Different from fat-storage white adipocytes, beige adipocytes burn excessive fat
    and glucose. ASC-targeted NP-based device can deliver bioactive agents/drugs to
    subcutaneous ASCs and subsequently induce them differentiation into beige adipocytes,
    resulting in body weight and fat loss and improved metabolic health. This local
    (transdermal device) and targeted (ASC-targeted NPs) delivery technology bypasses
    the liver and other tissues, thus minimizing administration frequency, enhancing
    compliance, and most importantly, maximizing overall treatment efficacy while
    decreasing side effects. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunity
    of the FatBurningNanoTM technology and help establish product-market fit through
    upcoming customer interviews. The feedback from these activities will facilitate
    product development, and its ultimate commercialization.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to provide a new means of creating broad-spectrum antimicrobial fabric treatments
    with a low barrier to entry for manufacturers. This technology promises to deliver
    antimicrobial coatings at lower overall economic and environmental costs, by reducing
    solvent usage, waste, and coating loss. Antimicrobial treatments are already used
    in medicine, as anti-infective treatments of bandages, catheters, and other medical
    items, and in garments and textiles, as anti-odor treatments. The lower barrier
    to entry for garment manufacturers is expected to enable more widespread adoption
    of the technology, which in turn will reduce material and energy waste from excessive
    laundering and save consumers money. The technology can be adapted to a wide range
    of fiber types and can be applied without specialized equipment, facilitating
    the integration into existing manufacturing processes and giving manufacturers
    access to premium market segments with minimal upfront investment. \n\n\nThis
    I-Corps project will help improve the market penetration of antimicrobial treatments,
    which in turn will provide consumers with superior garment performance at reduced
    environmental and economic costs. The technology uses a new form of soluble silver

    a variety of different fiber types with bioactive silver, which enables the antimicrobial
    coatings to be applied at any stage in the manufacturing process. Proof of concept

    be found in civil engineering infrastructure development projects where construction
    is undertaken in areas affected by expansive soils, i.e. soils that shrink and
    swell in response to changes soil moisture level.  Such shrink/swell activity
    in foundation soils is a leading cause of structural damage to roadways and other
    infrastructure systems built upon them. In the United States Texas, Colorado,
    Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota
    are among the states with major problems due to presence of expansive soil. Expansive
    soils have reportedly caused problems in other parts of the world as well. Traditionally,
    lime and Portland cement have been used to stabilize such expansive soils. However,
    these traditional stabilizers cannot be used in all soil conditions. In such situations,
    the only viable solution is to remove the native soil and replace it with better
    quality materials. The proposed I-Corps technology involves a sustainable soil
    stabilizer that overcomes many of the limitations found in the traditional stabilizers.
    \ It provides a more economical alternative in projects where remove-and-replace
    strategy is currently used.  \n\nThis I-Corps project explores opportunities for
    commercialization of a novel soil stabilizer which uses an inorganic compound
    known as geopolymer as the key ingredient. Geopolymers are synthesized using abundantly
    available natural materials and/or industrial by-products such as fly ash and
    ground blast furnace slag. Unlike traditional soil stabilizers (viz. hydrated
    lime and Portland cement) which require vast amounts of energy during production,
    geopolymers are synthesized at or near ambient temperatures. Accordingly, the
    new stabilizer represents a more sustainable alternative to traditional soil stabilizers.
    \ Extensive laboratory testing and microstructural studies conducted during the
    product development phase demonstrate that the new stabilizer can achieve more
    than 90% reduction in shrink/swell potential.  The experimental data also confirm
    that the geopolymer-based stabilizer can be used effectively to overcome a number
    of significant limitations that exist in the traditional stabilizers, such as
    inability to treat sulfate-bearing soils. Traditional lime stabilization requires
    a waiting period of 4-7 days for the stabilizing reactions to take place; this
    causes interruption in work flow and delay in construction.  In such situations,
    the new stabilizer can be used to treat the native soil and improve its engineering
    properties and thus eliminate need for expensive remove-and-replace operations.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an enabling technology for the cost-competitive production of biolubricant base-oils with better performance using 100% renewable carbon to meet growing customer pressure for sustainable products. The produced environmentally-acceptable products have a total over $60 billion global market and applications in industrial machinery, commercial and consumer automotives, grease, personal care products, turbines, transformers, aviation engines and machinery, marine vessels, hydropower production machinery, and others. Successful commercialization of this technology and products will bring multiple societal and commercial benefits. First, the designer biolubricants, guided by molecular simulation modeling, will bring market transformation for efficient and durable products.  Second, the technology will bring feedstock flexibility for new and "greener" products innovation by utilizing the nation's abundant carbon neutral feedstocks; thus, addressing environmental eco-system concerns. Third, it will improve rural economies by utilizing the feedstocks and resources that are available in those areas. Fourth, educational benefits are an integral element of our proposed work, as it will provide opportunities to train technicians and early career researchers.

    This I-Corps project will gather customers' feedback and establish the commercial feasibility of this patent-pending technology on energy-efficient and atom-economic production of biolubricant base-oils with tailored molecular architectures and tunable specifications. Initial specifications, techno-economic analysis, and customer's feedback suggest that the products are cost-competitive and suitable for current high performance applications. Bio-degradability, and tunable specifications of the products will offer significant competitive advantages to the market. We will gather more customers' feedback through the proposed I-Corps National program to gain more market insight for products. Especially, we will (1) evaluate market gaps and customers' desire for next generation products, (2) validate the market entry strategy, (3) analyze competitions and competitive advantages for our products, (4) analyze and validate value-propositions and their fit to the market need, and (5) analyze the market price of competitors' products. The outcome of this market research will significantly advance the commercialization of our products and technology.

    The CdTe thin-film panels require high energy consumption during manufacturing,

    project will explore the commercial opportunities of manufacturing antimony chalcogenides
    thin-film solar panel with lower cost, higher efficiency, and less energy consumption

    The broad impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is an innovative high throughput technology for screening drugs in small animals including the popular model organism C. elegans, a millimeter-sized nematode. Age is a significant risk factor for a variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular ailments and neurodegenerative disorders. It is projected that by 2030, 20% of the US population will be 65 years or older indicating that with the growing aging population the incidence of these diseases is expected to rise. Likewise, soil-transmitted helminthic infections are prevalent worldwide and there is increasing evidence that parasitic nematodes are becoming resistant to available drugs. C. elegans is a low-cost and high throughput animal model for identifying drug candidates for age-related diseases and parasitic infections. The I-Corps project has the potential to address current bottlenecks in conducting high throughput drug assays in the C. elegans model, thereby paving the path for a drug discovery pipeline. The impact of this project is on alleviating the socio-economic burden associated with age-associated diseases and parasitic infections.

    This I-Corps project seeks to develop a microfluidics-based technology for automated drug testing on small nematodes. Current approaches to drug testing on C. elegans involve tedious steps of manual picking and transferring animals cultured on agar plates and moreover do not allow flexible control of culture environment. The proposed technology builds on basic principles of microscale flows, locomotion of active swimmers and crawlers, and low-cost wide-field imaging. Novel features of the technology for drug testing include an optimized microfluidic pillar arena that forms a habitat for growing animals, with unprecedented control over reagent delivery and culture environment. The low-cost wide-field imaging allows facile video recording of animal response to different drugs. The proposed innovation will markedly advance the throughput of in vivo drug and toxicity assays in an established, high throughput and low-cost animal model.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be to improve our understanding of the market forces that drive the need/use of antimicrobial materials. With ~1.7 million healthcare-associated infections causing upwards of 99,000 deaths annually in the United States, and adding about $30-45 billion to health care costs every year, the potential societal impact stemming from this proposed activity include a better understanding of the market forces that govern the need/use of antimicrobial materials. Understanding such forces will be important for the creation of the next generation of antimicrobial materials, and will impact the fields of materials and polymer science, textile engineering, packaging, and infectious disease (microbiology, virology) by providing performance guidelines in terms of material characteristics, physical properties, and antimicrobial efficacy. Food processing, packaging and service industries, waste water treatment, daycare facilities, and personal households are other potential areas that will benefit from this project. As such, given the potential commercial applications of platform antimicrobial technologies, narrowing the number of possible products and identifying a few key markets will be important for their commercialization, and this effort will be to better define the most viable products from which to commercialize platform antimicrobial technologies.

    This I-Corps project aims to help the research team arrive at a go/no-go decision on whether to pursue commercialization of an anti-infective material: comprised of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) into which are embedded photosensitizers (PS, chemical compounds that react with light and emit biocidal oxygen), this photoactive material, termed NFC-PS, is capable of the rapid, efficient, and low-cost sterilization of a wide range of infective agents, including drug-resistant bacteria and viruses, making it a platform technology from which to develop self-sterilizing materials. The intellectual merits of the proposed voice-of-customer research will establish the market-driven need for antimicrobial materials, including: i) to identify what customers and/or potential licensees would need in terms of anti-infective material properties (e.g. longevity, chemical resistance, integration into existing products, maximum cost or price points, EPA and/or FDA regulatory approvals); ii) to help identify potential products that could be improved by adding antimicrobial characteristics to them; and iii) to complete a business model canvas for the NFC-PS technology. Initial product ideation based upon the NFC-PS platform technology will be narrowed to 1-2 main products from a much broader number of market categories, and will be used to identify what prototype(s) should be developed along the path to commercialization.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project is to investigate the challenges that data scientists face in debugging big data analytics today and to investigate the commercial potential of research work on interactive and automated debugging of big data analytics. Big data analytics is increasingly important in the 21st century, where our daily lives leave behind a detailed digital record. Decision-makers of all kinds, from companies to government agencies, would like to base their actions on data. If successful, this project will offer a unique opportunity to discover software development tooling needs for big data systems and to identify innovative software tooling products that sit across the software stack from the user-facing API all the way down to the systems infrastructure.

    This I-Corps project builds on early research work on real-time debugging primitives and tool-assisted fault-localization services for big data processing applications written in modern data intensive scalable computing (DISC) systems like Apache Spark. Designing debugging primitives for DISC requires re-thinking the traditional step-through debugging primitives as provided by tools such as gdb. For example, a breakpoint feature that simply pauses the entire computation would waste large amounts of computational resources and prevent correct tasks from completing, reducing overall throughput. Further, requiring the user to inspect the millions of intermediate records produced during execution is clearly infeasible. When a failure or incorrect result is generated (e.g., outlier), pinpointing the root cause is extremely time-consuming and expensive due to massive scale of data. In short, the intellectual merit of this I-Corps project is to investigate how users can benefit from expressive debugging primitives and automated fault localization services when they must leverage for data science and big data analytics capabilities.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project centers around cancer treatment using wireless radiofrequency. Radiofrequency ablation is a minimally invasive procedure where surgeons burn tissue inside the body using electricity. Ablation treatment has been applied in several medical disciplines including oncology, cardiology, dermatology, pain management, etc.According to the National Cancer Institute, there were more than 1.6 million new cases of cancer in 2017 and approximately 600,000 cancer patients died. Many of these cancer patients can be treated with ablation therapy. A significant amount of funding is invested in cancer care, with $125 billion spent in 2010 alone; this number is estimated to reach $156 billion in 2020. Other diseases have similar numbers of affected patents and high amounts of care expenditures as well. This I-Corps program will provide opportunities for the team to explore various avenues for the commercialization of their wireless radiofrequency ablation technology that has broad application in many treatment areas.

    This I-Corps project is the first wireless radiofrequency ablation device designed to streamline and simplify the current ablation procedure. Using the principle of magnetic resonance, a wirelessly powered radiofrequency ablation device simply includes an ablation generator and a needle. The ablation generator serves as a transmitting circuit that wirelessly sends power to the needle's receiving coil. The receiving coil is connected to the electrodes at the needle tip that ablates tumor tissue in contact. Existing ablation methods have multiple wires tethered to the ablation equipment that limit the surgeon's dexterity to position the ablation needles during the procedure. The weight and dragging of the wires could increase patient setup time and cause potential tissue laceration. Also, a limited number of ablation needles can be used simultaneously, making it time consuming to ablate large tumors. This project's wireless ablation technology requires no wires and allows an unlimited number of ablation needles during the procedure. An initial prototype has been developed to prove the concept of wireless ablation and tests have been performed to prove the concept of the proposed technology.

    supply commercial beekeepers with a way to remotely monitor and identify honey
    bee colonies in need of management in real time, regardless of location, allowing
    for a reduction in annual colony loss. Currently, commercial beekeepers must rely
    on time intensive manual inspections to determine which colonies need assistance
    in the field. This practice is especially resource intensive for commercial migratory
    beekeepers who frequently relocate their honey bees to fulfill pollination services
    for US farmers. In addition, this proposed approach will allow for measuring impact
    of various agricultural landscapes on honey bee colony health, enabling farmers
    to engage in quantitative based discussions with farmers about pollinator friendly
    best practices. Ultimately this I-Crops project focuses on leveraging the economic
    importance of honey bees to create financial incentives for pollinator friendly
    farming practices across agricultural landscapes. \n\nThis I-Corps project leverages
    traditional large dataset analysis and machine learning to decipher and detect
    adverse conditions within the honey bee colony, and how the landscapes in which
    colonies reside contribute to overall colony health. This is possible through
    continuous monitoring of the internal colony environment, which is meticulously
    regulated and stable when the colony is healthy, and utilization of long range
    low power communications infrastructure. When a colony is unhealthy or suffers
    an adverse event, like the loss of a queen, the colonies internal environment
    is disrupted. Honey bee populations have experienced large annual losses recently
    and although substantial research has been conducted on honey bees residing in
    backyard or university research apiaries, no work (apart from limited popular
    press interviews) have attempted to document the problems, economic and biological,
    that commercial migratory beekeepers and their bees face on their annual pollination
    cycle. Remote monitoring of these commercial colonies will provide much needed
    insight into the inner lives of this cohort of economically critical insects,
    in addition to providing optimization and logistical support to an essential component
    of US agricultural production.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    technology has its basis in a range of microfluidic cooling products. The potential
    of the technology is its positive impacts on several computing technologies where
    it may expand the limits of processing frequency and therefore system speed/performance.
    Commercial applications that can benefit from the project's technology are broad,
    such as those requiring the acceleration of high-performance computing in data
    centers, graphics computing in the fields of artificial intelligence, self-driving
    transportation, videogame hardware, digital currency (blockchain) technology,

    cooling technology, confirming if there is a need/interest by other industries,
    such as lasers, concentrated solar photovoltaics, and thermoelectric products,
    among many potential markets that use liquid-cooling systems at some level. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project is motivated by a technology that consists of an embedded microfluidic
    cooling layer that offers significantly enhanced heat removal capabilities when
    compared with current thermal hardware -- this is as a result of eliminating the
    thermal interfaces and heat spreaders commonly used in microelectronic devices.
    The heat removal is directly managed by bonding the microfluidic cooling layer
    to the silicon chip surface through a metallic joint. The resulting micro-cooling
    layer replaces the need for the heat spreader used in current technologies since
    the microstructures embedded in the cooling layer have the appropriate feature
    sizes and layout with an appropriate flow distribution through engineered manifolds
    for effective heat dissipation. This technology provides the capability of unlocking
    the clock frequency on micro-processing units by allowing the input of higher
    voltages to the computing cores, while also keeping the device temperature below
    design limits. Laboratory experimentation with these microfluidic cooling layers
    under a wide variety of operating conditions and refrigerants has demonstrated
    capabilities for removing heat fluxes of up to 500 W/cm2; a 5x increase when compared
    with the current maximum heat fluxes of commercial, high-end central processing

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project on healthcare, quality of life, and the medical device industry is tremendous. The novel technology and advancement of biodegradable metals and biomimetic interfaces will lead to next-generation medical devices and implants that promote tissue healing and eliminate secondary surgeries for implant removal. This will improve quality of life for patients who need medical implants to support bones and tissue damaged by disease or trauma, and reduce overall healthcare costs. The project will build the foundation for commercializing biodegradable metallic implants and devices, which, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the medical device industry. The products resulting from this project will reduce pain and complications, eliminate secondary surgeries, and accelerate healing and recovery for patients who need medical implants due to trauma or disease.

    This I-Corps project will advance technology that eliminates the drawbacks of the non-degradable medical alloys on the market today. Magnesium (Mg) based alloys are a novel class of biodegradable metallic materials that have attractive mechanical and biological properties for a wide range of medical implant applications, such as orthopedic, spinal, dental, and craniofacial implants. The key challenge in commercializing Mg-based alloys for medical implant applications lies in controlling the degradation rate. NSF support has contributed to a novel class of biocompatible Mg alloys along with biomimetic surface treatment to provide tunable degradation rates, desirable bioactivity, and excellent mechanical strength for supporting faster healing and regeneration of damaged tissues. This novel solution contains non-toxic natural elements that induce healing and reduce inflammation, departed from traditional alloy design. The I-Corps project will transform this technology to commercially viable products that will benefit the customers in need.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project relates to the developments in precision/personalized medicine, and specifically, to much-needed improvements in accuracy and speed of finding genome variants using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The personalized medicine concepts are based on individual genome variants and the personalized medicine market is expected to reach $178 billion in 2022. The cost advantage of a fast and accurate variant-finding product will be proportional to the number of genomes analyzed by users in this market. There has been a recent exponential increase in the size and scope of whole genome sequencing projects from 10,000 publicly available human genomes in 2016 to the UK 100,000 Genomes Project to even larger, though less-clearly defined, sequencing projects involving 1,000,000 participants proposed in the US (Precision Medicine Initiative, and Million Veteran Program) and China. In a likely and important scenario of sequencing the whole US population in the foreseeable future, the cost saving could be several billion dollars, thus making such efforts more feasible.

    This I-Corps project will enable entrepreneurial education and customer discovery for a software that will be based on a novel comprehensive method of genome variant detection, GROM (Genome Rearrangement Omni-Mapper). GROM boasts lightning-speed runtimes, an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art variant detection pipelines. While drastically reducing computational time, GROM provides superior overall variant detection compared to commonly employed algorithms. These unique advantages over available tools both in speed and precision could make GROM a very desirable application in this field (utilized via either licensing or pay-per-use commercial models). This will require a better understanding of a potential market and customer discovery. The process will include an educational component at I-Corps workshops and a discovery component via meetings and active communication with numerous potential users of the technology in commercial and non-commercial entities. The customer discovery effort may result in developing an appropriate business plan for attracting investments in a potential startup that will perform further development and licensing of the product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve electricity access for island communities and enable cost-effective restoration of coastal energy systems following natural disasters. Grid-weak regions and island communities typically have poor access to affordable, resilient, and clean energy solutions compared to their mainland counterparts. The frequency and severity of natural disasters is increasing; resilient and flexible electricity supply systems are more critical than ever, especially for island communities. Making effective recovery decisions addresses the different strategies of preparedness for energy systems and can drastically improve resulting economic and community impacts. This project will enable the efficient transmission of energy to island communities through a new technology, mobile energy storage transmission (MEST). The recent improvements of energy storage technology cost, size, and performance have resulted in technoeconomic feasibility of this innovative technology. Implementation of MEST will both improve long-term energy access for island communities and provide rapidly-deployable, flexible, affordable, and resilient electricity delivery systems for short-term crises. The advent of MEST coincides with the increasing importance of island energy systems; a market earmarked for high-growth over coming decades as sea levels rise, island nations continue to develop, and emphasis is put on development of sustainable energy systems.

    This I-Corps project is based on findings which identified a significant challenge in addressing the interdependency between infrastructure systems, in particular, pertaining to the role that energy systems play in the disaster recovery process of other infrastructures and communities. The proposed investigation addresses a missing link between resilience of infrastructure networks and multi-industry impacts to more effectively guide preparedness and recovery decisions. This project will evaluate scenario-specific applications of MEST for island communities; complementing the shortcomings of conventional cabled transmission. While on-shore cabled transmission is an efficient and low-cost mode of transporting electricity, subsea cabled transmission is costly and often results in poor redundancy of electricity supply. This novel transmission model, comprised of commercially available components, uses batteries and conventional freight transportation to move electricity from one market to another; providing service commensurate to a subsea cabled interconnector, but with added flexibility, resilience, and many benefits of traditional grid-level energy storage systems. MEST is founded on established economic theory, energy storage technology, and various market data. Research indicates potential for MEST in both long-term island power provision and short-term disaster relief. The combination of these findings indicates a promising future for impact and commercialization of MEST following this I-Corps project.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will make cutting edge cell therapies more affordable and accessible for a larger patient population. Cell therapies are among the most promising treatments for life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and severe immunodeficiency. While these cell therapies have been recently FDA approved, they remain extremely expensive, with single treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Manufacturing cell therapies requires expensive reagents and facilities and highly skilled labor, which drives up healthcare costs and makes cell therapies unattainable for many patients in greatest need. This I-Corps project aims to revolutionize the field of cell therapy manufacturing with an innovatively low-cost cell processing technology. This approach can efficiently modify normal cells into potent cell therapies and isolate desired cell populations for quality control. It benefits from low cost operation and eliminates the need in expensive skilled personal. This technology has a great potential to usher in a new era of affordable cell therapies and cost-effective healthcare.

    This I-Corps project utilizes a microfluidic platform that can sort and engineer cells with little to no impact on cell viability and function. Instead of relying on expensive and dangerous methods such as viruses or electric shock, the approach relies on natural cell response to rapid compressions to cause the processed cells to uptake molecules that can turn cells into life-saving cell therapies. This uptake can also be used to deliver labels to the cell interior to indicate desirable or undesirable cell traits for an easy and rapid readout for quality control. The entire technology is housed on a microfluidic chip that can process over 100,000 cells per second. The technology for cell sorting makes use of inherent cell mechanical properties and does not require any additional chemical or biological cell modification. This microfluidic platform can perform tasks that are normally extremely complicated, such as cell engineering, cell labeling, and cell sorting, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for both making cell therapies and processing them into safe, high-quality treatments.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly improve end-users' data analysis productivity and result accuracy. The Resource Enhancement and Advanced Discovery System (READS) technology streamlines users approaches to locating the most relevant analytic tools for their specific problems through natural language capabilities.  While focusing on geoscientists, financial analysts, and biotechnologists as potential users at the inception of this I-Corps project, READS can be customized for any discipline and its specific data analytic tool requirements.  The three user examples listed above are only the beginning of the potential applications for which this analytic tool discovery system can be utilized.  The ability to query resources with discipline-specific language and increase result accuracy by annotating the queried resources with domain-specific terminology will drastically reduce the amount of time required to locate requisite tools, and ultimately attract users.  New users will not need to start from scratch in their analyses, but will be able to build upon the resources discovered by others, therefore maximizing productivity.  This broad range of appeal, combined with an accessible user interface not seen in other tools, underscores the potential for significant commercial impact of this technology.

    This I-Corps project   aims to assist users in easily locating the "best" analytic tools for their specific task through an analytic tool discovery system for interdisciplinary data analysis. Data manipulation challenges are emerging and the integration of dataset analytic tools into a comprehensive framework is needed to further knowledge discovery.  Abundant tools and methods are available to the research and business communities to analyze datasets across disciplines, but it is often difficult to locate the most relevant tools for a specific task. Adding context to queries greatly enhances a users' ability to retrieve requisite analytic tools.  READS integrates analytic tool information into a one-stop-shop retrieval system capable of accessing valuable metadata from multiple repositories.  The system allows end-users to retrieve analytic tool information by submitting either keyword-based queries and/or free text-based questions.  The system leverages natural language processing, text mining, and an ontology-based metadata annotation system to allow collections of analytic tools and methods to be linked and discovered with high accuracy.  This allows end-users to discover, reuse, validate, share, and exchange knowledge related to their chosen data analytic tools. This novel approach facilitates the accessible analysis of cross-domain datasets, greatly enhancing end-users' ability to more efficiently answer challenging questions.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to enable a consumer device for the detection of infectious pathogens at the point-of-need
    instead of in a central laboratory environment. The project will enhance current
    approaches to disease detection and monitoring in remote and low-resource settings
    by rapid and sensitive detection of infectious agents and automated data-logging.
    The commercial impact of the detection system leverages current smartphone capability
    in concert with advances in imaging, microfluidics, and enhanced computation to
    deliver detection of multiple important human pathogens all within a portable
    format.  Further, widespread user experience with smartphone technologies mitigates
    the need for additional training steps and lowers barriers to adoption. This project
    will support extensive customer discovery with field workers, healthcare community
    workers, clinicians, nurses, and procurement officials within governmental and
    aid organizations. \n\nThis I-Corps project integrates the smartphone with external
    hardware and disposable microfluidic chips to enable a portable pathogen detection
    platform. The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation
    of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that
    quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle
    diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard
    for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the
    sensitivity of pathogen detection. In the presence of pathogens, DNA amplification
    occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution
    that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system.
    A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing
    both detection results and immediately logging the data. Data can be readily pushed
    to the cloud where organizations can track detection events in real-time. Therefore,
    this I-Corps project will explore the market potential for smartphone-based pathogen
    detection in remote and low-resource settings and for applications where disease
    surveillance and monitoring is of great utility. To this end, this project will
    provide fast and affordable infectious pathogen detection solutions while aiding
    in effective healthcare resource distribution.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address the urgent need of highly durable and more comfortable foot orthoses to benefit military service members and veterans, athletes, as well as other professionals suffering from foot or ankle injuries. The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers. Discoveries from this project will inform the decision of the next step towards a startup and commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will provide the manufacturing industry with an approach to identify and detect cyber-physical attacks within their production environments in real-time. Currently, the manufacturing industry is operating production systems vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may cause produced parts to not meet intended design requirements. Such a deviation from design intent could result in damaged products, loss of customer trust, and potentially injure employees and/or customers. The adoption of the proposed approach will secure manufacturers from cyber-physical attacks and create a strong supply chain. This will allow manufacturers to continue to produce sensitive parts both for the general public and the defense industry, increasing the difficulty of a malicious attack to affect part production. Through successful completion of this program, the I-Corps team will further develop awareness in this area through mentoring graduate students and discussing cyber-physical security with manufacturers across the United States.

    This I-Corps project employs both traditional decision analysis and data analysis techniques to identify and detect malicious events within manufacturing systems. This is done through a two-phase approach. First, a cyber-physical vulnerability assessment is completed which highlights areas within the production environment susceptible to malicious attack. Employing decision trees and process mapping, the vulnerability assessment is used to provide a high level overview of the cyber-physical resiliency of a manufacturing facility. Second, the proposed detection approach consists of an air-gapped sensor suite which can be placed on any piece of critical equipment to detect malicious events in real-time. The proposed approach analyzes side-channel measurements independent of the machine such as power consumption, vibration, and sound to identify anomalies within the process. Through performing the vulnerability assessment and implementing the proposed sensor suite, the entire production facility can be secured from malicious cyber-physical attacks intended to reduce part quality and/or sabotage produced parts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to facilitate the development of a versatile point-of-care (POC) biosensor for decentralized laboratory testing, and to investigate the market potential for early detection of protein biomarkers for diseases. The focus areas are in cardiovascular disease, breast milk banks, and assisted living facilities. There is a need for early diagnosis of heart failure, especially myocardial infarction, by monitoring cardiac biomarkers. This is not only for the patient's survival, but also reducing treatment costs. This biosensor technology will potentially be the first product on the market for a portable, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project may accelerate POC diagnostics research and personalized medicine, including early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Thus, it will permit a more effective deployment of therapies. The developed product is expected to find broader commercial applications including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical researchers, life science studies, hospital and healthcare facilities, diagnostics and patient monitoring, home and remote use, as well as drug discovery in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.

    This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for the innovative biosensor. The end product will be a lab-on-a-chip based POC technology for use in complex biological media, like whole blood, which commonly requires sample pretreatment and/or separation of the large blood cells. The POC device will provide exclusive delivery of protein biomarkers (e.g. troponin) to the detection area for highly sensitive and reliable detection from a drop of whole blood. The uniqueness of the innovation lies in the nanoscale structures that are fabricated into thin metal films and integrated with microfluidics for direct optical measurement. The combination of on-chip/in-line sample preparation and fluid handling integrated with a simple, label-free, optical detection system enables a complete lab-on-chip system. This system may offer several advantages over conventional biomarker detection methods for use in complex samples. These include high throughput, high sensitivity, elimination of interferences from large blood cells, lower cost, ease of operation and simplified sample pretreatment. The I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative applications of parallel, multiple biomarker analysis and determine the readiness to transition the biosensor to a viable product.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in enabling new location-based services by using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons in several important market verticals such as public transportation, retail, and events management, to name just a few.  BLE beacon-based software solutions can provide low-cost location-based services in both indoor and outdoor locations, supporting, for example, automatic foot traffic counts and location-based product promotions. As an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology, BLE beacons have the potential to become the leading proximity technology. However, the pros and cons of using these technologies in different settings are still not fully understood. For instance, privacy issues regarding location sharing in public spaces can impede the adoption of these technologies. This I-Corps project will explore implementation and commercialization opportunities of beacon-based technologies in airports, business conferences, and retail stores. The success of this project can help promote the adoption of this IoT technology and result in improved efficiency in public services and enhanced quality of people's daily lives.

    This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon technology to provide new and low-cost location-based services. A BLE beacon actively broadcasts Bluetooth signals, which can be received by nearby Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. Thus, mobile applications can leverage the beacons that are installed at different locations to detect people's movements, for instance, sensing when people enter or exit certain locations, and estimating the number of people co-located at certain locations. Effective beacon-based solutions need to address the following: ensure accurate movement detection when different beacons' Bluetooth signals interfere with each other; provide a scalable service where a large number of beacons can be supported by different mobile platforms; and include privacy-preserving features to address people's privacy concerns. This project will lead to a better understanding of varying requirements for beacon-based location services and how they might be customized to potentially service a variety of market verticals.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is twofold:  it lowers cost and knowledge barriers for smaller companies and startups which need to run scientific simulations, and it reduces time to market for product design firms by allowing faster, more integrated access to simulation tools and data. This project provides an end-to-end, user-oriented, cloud computing infrastructure that embraces the needs of all three critically involved stakeholders: users, model/tool providers, and computational resource providers. The cloud model has proved to be a cost effective, reliable solution to many information service challenges, and a cloud-based platform for scientific simulation and computation has the potential to impact the high-tech community by inducing a fundamental shift in the way scientific simulation and data are used. Small companies, especially emerging startups, need not invest in simulation software, but instead can utilize an extensive simulation ecosystem for product design. Companies with access to this platform will become less restricted by local computational resources, and more productive with a larger suite of simulation tools to solve design problems.

    This I-Corps project is based on a comprehensive infrastructure to host and execute scientific simulations and store and access the output data with ease. With multiple simulation codes available in one place, workflows can be created which use the output of one tool to provide input to the next. This modular approach enables users to combine different tools and customize the workflow to their own needs. Simulation outputs are all stored and the resulting scientific data can be mined for knowledge. User actions are also recorded and analyzed to enhance the user experience. Through customer discovery activities within I-Corps and continued requirements gathering from existing and potential communities, this cloud-based simulation platform will potentially change how researchers, students, educators, and industry practitioners engage with simulation and data on a day-to-day basis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with the emerging field of Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI). One of the main techniques for such interfaces is magnetoencephalography (MEG), where brain waves are read by using highly-sensitive magnetometers. A substantial technological hurdle exists in bringing such techniques to the mass market, however, in that existing equipment for performing MEG studies is based on SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometers, which requires temperatures below 1K and highly specialized, shielded facility. These requirements mean that existing MEG facilities are very expensive both to acquire and operate and there exists only a handful of such facilities around the world. This I-Corps project aims to bring this technology to mass market using a recent breakthrough that shows potential for MEG at room temperature, in an unshielded environment and in 1000X smaller form factor. This will enable wider adoption and use of the technology in clinical and research settings.

    This I-Corps project further develops a magnetic field sensor with sensitivity comparable to that of SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometers while maintaining the ability to operate unshielded in Earth's ambient magnetic field and at room temperature. This sensor leverages the newly discovered phenomenon of Acoustically Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance (ADFMR) in order to operate. By using strain waves instead of microwaves to drive ferromagnetic resonance, this technique increases the coupling between the excitation wave and the magnetic element by several orders of magnitude.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to allow individuals who are blind and visually impaired (BVI) to perceive images better than they currently can. Current technologies are insufficient since they only provide very little data to the user through tactile methods. Through the Multimodal image perception system (MIPS), students who are BVI will be able to perceive images through alternate sensory channels such as haptic, sound and tactile feedback. This would enable them to be active participants in exploration of STEM subjects such as biology or chemistry which rely heavily on understanding images. The use of this system would also allow individuals with BVI to overcome the stigma and fear of pursuing STEM majors as college students. Moreover, according to surveys by the Department of Education individuals with STEM majors often had higher paying jobs as compared to non-STEM majors. The use of the MIPS may promote their participation in STEM fields, which would allow individuals with BVI to pursue higher paying careers and promote diversification of the workforce by making individuals with BVI more economically competitive.

    This I-Corps project will contribute to addressing the improvement in the education for individuals who are blind and visually impaired (BVI). Experiments have been conducted with individuals with BVI to compare their understanding of images with the multimodal image perception system (MIPS), and with conventional systems such as tactile images. Through these experiments, it has been identified that the individuals who are blind have a better accuracy and understanding of images using the MIPS as compared to using the tactile images. Through the I-Corps program, the team will further investigate the most critical needs of the end users and determine the most optimal path towards commercializing the technology to allow it to be used by educators around the country to improve their students' understanding of STEM fields.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project facilitate the design and operation of electromagnetic telemetry for underground wireless communication in oilfield measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD). The performance of an electromagnetic telemetry system is heavily dependent on electrical properties of the underground formation, as well as the deployment of downhole and surface antennas. Rigorous electromagnetic full wave simulations are critical in design, development, and deployment of an electromagnetic telemetry system for a drilling job. The modeling software package will potentially be the first product on the market with the capability of providing efficient 3D simulations of electromagnetic telemetry systems in complicated underground environments. Besides the oil and gas industry, electromagnetic telemetry can also be used in other important areas such as CO2 sequestration, deep borehole disposal of nuclear waste, and geothermal energy exploration.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of a 3D electromagnetic telemetry modeling tool for the oil and gas industry and other areas involving drilling activities. A realistic electromagnetic telemetry system is an extremely multiscale structure, and rigorously modeling such a system is beyond the capabilities of available commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The proposed product is based on the recent advancement of computational electromagnetics algorithms using 3D integral equations with a novel coated thin wire model to simulate the metallic drill string and borehole environment in layered formation. The product as a modeling software can be several orders more accurate than existing commercial simulation tools for the analysis of electromagnetic telemetry systems. The goal of this I-Corps team is to investigate the market potential of this technology and related product in the oilfield and other relevant applicable areas.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on significant improvements in accuracy and cost reduction of eye-related disease diagnosis by providing a high-quality, high-speed tissue imaging solution. Specifically, the project will shorten clinical scan time, and as a result, increase image resolution while reducing the number of required patient clinic visits. These improvements directly lower associated medical costs. The project goal is to create a new-generation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a technique that is used in the clinical practice to provide cross-sectional images of the retina.  Currently, the biggest challenge faced by OCT clinical applications is their slow scan speed, which leads to low image resolutions and therefore unsatisfying clinical experience. A high-quality, high-speed signal processing tool is needed for reliable clinical decision-making and disease monitoring with OCT systems.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a new-generation of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).  The I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the innovation, a system capable of decreasing the signal processing time of swept source OCT (SS-OCT) devices by up to ten times according to lab tests. This device is based on a family of novel signal processing algorithms that significantly improve the accuracy and speed required for the medical images to be acquired. The SS-OCT platform will be enhanced in terms of the image acquisition speed, accuracy, and cost. This, in turn, will decrease the number of visits a patient needs to make to an ophthalmology clinic while increasing the overall clinic capacity to attend visiting patients per day, generating more revenue for those centers.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in resolving the long-standing graphical access problem for millions of blind and visually-impaired (BVI) people. Lack of access to these substantial informational components of daily life represents one of the biggest challenges to the independence and productivity of BVI individuals. This project addresses this vexing accessibility issue through a viable information access solution built on commercial, low-cost touchscreen-based smart computing devices such as smartphones and tablets. The solution will assist BVI people by potentially providing dynamic access to digital school books and test materials, graphics in vocational settings, digital maps, and graphical contents of printed materials.  The broader impact of this project is that it will promote empowerment of BVI individuals by supporting increased educational advancement, vocational opportunities, enhanced quality of life, and overall greater independence.

    This I-Corp project will explore the commercial potential and market fit for a touchscreen-based graphics screen reader. This solution will allow blind people to freely explore and access graphical information via vibration and auditory feedback on a smartphone or tablet. Through a battery of usability, psychophysical, and technical experiments, the technology has been shown to be effective compared to existing solutions and is accurate in conveying informative graphical materials such as graphs, shapes, patterns, and indoor maps. The focus of the proposed I-Corp project is to understand the commercial fit and usability of the solution in meeting end-user needs and problems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the quality of life and care for people living with complex, chronic skin conditions like psoriasis. This I-Corps project will allow customer discovery research for a novel mobile-based imaging system for the automatic objective assessment of psoriasis lesions and management of the treatment. The solution developed here provides a personalized chronic disease management which objectively assesses the disease progression and improves accessibility to clinical professionals as needed toward next-generation patient management systems. Psoriasis is an incurable skin disease affecting millions in the US who often suffer from severe physical pain, discomfort, social isolation, and psychological distress. This I-Corps project provides an objective evaluation of disease improvement that will enable physicians to keep track of treatment efficacy for various systemic and biologic treatments for each patient. It will potentially help the approval process for new treatments for dermatological diseases by simplifying the process of disease evaluation during clinical trials. It will provide patient empowerment for taking control and preventing disease progression and improve treatment adherence thus reducing economic burden for the patients and the health system.

    This mobile-based imaging system includes a mobile app that utilizes a unique image processing and skin analysis algorithm that captures consistent calibrated images and specifies the severity level of the disease. The system determines Psoriasis Severity Index Score (PASI), a clinically accepted psoriasis scoring method, as a quantitative measure and based on clinical guidelines provides a descriptive measure (mild, moderate, or severe) to the user. It will work with different classifications of psoriasis disease, different skin types and under varying light conditions. It is developed based on extensive research in image processing techniques through extraction of features that efficiently capture the information about variations in color, texture and border irregularities of the diseased skin. Cloud based processing and storage of disease severity information over time enable automatic tracking of disease progression and associated prescription mapping provides the ability to assess the efficacy of the treatment. In addition, to improve the clinical diagnosis of psoriasis a multimode hyperspectral dermatoscope is used to accurately map the distribution of skin melanin and hemoglobin.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project concerns the rehabilitation of movement deficits due to disease or injury. Commercially, the project falls within the rehabilitation robot market, specifically the segment that addresses neurological rehabilitation. Currently, available robotic rehabilitation technology focuses mainly on the recovery of motor function after stroke and restricts patient motion to a single plane. This project involves a robotic device that extends the scope of current rehabilitation robots by a) allowing unrestricted 3D movement, and b) incorporating somatosensory in addition to motor training methods. The commercial potential of this I-Corps project is not restricted to clinics specializing on stroke rehabilitation. The device can be used on a broad disease spectrum that includes stroke, but can be extended to patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and traumatic brain injuries.

    This I-Corps project further develops a robotic rehabilitation device that seeks to improve wrist/hand function. The robot comprises a series of motors that can passively move the human wrist/hand, or assist/resist active human wrist motion. It allows for unrestricted 3-dimensional motion while precisely recording wrist joint motion. The system is integrated with a visual virtual reality environment that can provide movement feedback and can serve as an interface for visual-based training regimes. The technology has been tested in over 300 human users aged 18-82 years. It has been applied to assess sensory and motor dysfunction in stroke survivors and patients with Parkinson's disease. Test-retest reliability and validity of its outcome measures has been established.

    Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of a tutoring, mentoring, and advising program to help community college students to complete Associate's degrees and successfully transfer to four-year institutions. Increasing the number and diversity of students entering, persisting and graduating with STEM degrees; and significantly aiding them with STEM internships and job placements is imperative to solving the critical national and state workforce deficit that encompasses 63 STEM occupations categorized by the U. S. Department of Labor. Improving STEM education pathways to engage and retain students in STEM programs requires creative interdisciplinary real world experiential learning strategies that integrate technology in delivering and reiterating content to 21st century learners.  Community colleges represent a special opportunity for increasing STEM majors. Two-year institutions are 'the entry point into higher education for most first-generation college students, particularly those from low-income, minority, and immigrant backgrounds'. Studies have shown that only 25 percent of these students complete a two-year degree and transfer to a four-year institution and only 17 percent complete a bachelor's degree. In 2000, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Community College Mentoring Program (BBCCMP) was founded to assist underrepresented minority, low income, and first generation community college students from six State University of New York (SUNY) community colleges with the transition from the two-year to four-year institutions and transitions either into the workforce or to graduate or professional school. The program involves tutoring, mentoring, and advising at the two and four-year institutions as well as a summer research program. In the almost fifteen years of the program, over 300 students have been involved. Over 80 percent of these students completed their Associate's degree and transferred to four-year institutions. Over 70 percent of these students are completing their bachelor's degree and 33 percent are going on for post-graduate work. This I-Corps for Learning project will develop ways to extend the impact of this program to other institutions throughout the country.

    The BBCCMP Program at Purchase College provides an extensive array of student supports. These begin when the student is recruited from the community college. Faculty coordinators at the community college identify and advise students who wish to enter the program. In addition, the program provides peer tutors and mentors at the community college. Students participate in a summer research program that not only provides research opportunities, but also has workshops on skills building, transferring, and career and post-baccalaureate opportunities. Students also participate in cohort and career building. In 2010 the SUNY Replication Project created a New York-based ecosystem in STEM based on the success of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Program within SUNY. Subsequently, six regional hubs comprising a mixture of two-year and four-year institutions were formed, and representatives met again at a second conference in 2012, to scale-up working with community colleges on student transitions. Through the NSF I-Corps initiative, this project will investigate sustainable methods to expand the success of BBCCMP to a larger number of institutions.

- abstractText: "The Los Angeles economy, the nation's second largest, is anchored
    by the health care, aerospace and defense industries. It is now also home to the
    rapidly growing Silicon Beach technology corridor, which spawns exciting new startups
    in software, digital and interactive media, renewable energy and a plethora of
    others. With one of the largest populations of graduating engineers in the country
    and a large manufacturing base, the Los Angeles region is ideally poised for a
    substantial transformation of its innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. The
    Los Angeles Regional I-Corps Node will help accelerate this transformation, by
    helping to increase the potential for leveraging the region's products and services.
    The University of Southern California led Node, consisting of a partnership between
    the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles,
    and the California Institute of Technology, will improve the region's ecosystem
    by: modeling how to leverage regional strengths to support commercialization nationally;
    studying team and customer-network formation; aligning technology and organizational
    maturity paths; and determining institutional support mechanisms to accelerate
    team coalescence, technology-to-product transformation, and customer acquisition.
    The Node will contribute to the NSF's mission of empowering STEM students, technical
    professionals, researchers and entrepreneurs to actively and effectively translate
    innovative ideas into large-scale commercialization. Annual I-Corps training sessions
    will be created that combine the strength of the partner institutions to offer
    new regional entrepreneurial opportunities and contribute novel resources to the
    I-Corps National Innovation Network (NIN). Two efforts will specifically focus
    on extending the Lean Start-up model to established industries in the Los Angeles
    region. The first will focus on health-care engineering, including a 'Mobile Demo
    Day' that will educate researchers on the convergence of engineering and medicine,
    regulatory hurdles, insurance strategies, medical industry distribution models,
    and related issues. The second will focus on aerospace and defense; offering unparalleled
    access to insight, mentoring, and opportunities to technologists in this area,
    along with strategies that can be used to develop an alignment with large-scale
    system integrators. \n\nThe Node will provide a vibrant research center for commercialization
    processes and outcomes. It will examine founding team formation, the coalescence
    of engineering talent with business skills, and customer and alliance development
    that cultivates relationships with industry incumbents. The research will also
    focus on evaluating and improving entrepreneurial skills in technology maturity
    assessments, understanding the level of technology maturity required for industrial
    adoption, and identifying institutional support mechanism for accelerating commercialization.
    The hypothesis that technology and organizational maturity proceed along independent
    and often unsynchronized timelines will be tested to better understand their interactions
    and identify factors that will increase success. Data from investors, customers,
    and advisors will help provide an awareness of each entrepreneur's stakeholder
    network and recognize correlations involved with both the activity and duration
    of fundraising. In a similar vein, the Node will study the duration to first sales,
    acquisition of government grants, and other milestones in cash generation. These
    factors will be tied to technology development milestones in order to identify
    relationships and key drivers, such as the importance of prospective customers
    and investors in accelerating operational cash flow to the company (i.e., through
    sales, rather than financing). Short-term outcomes will contribute to an understanding
    of the relative importance of various roles and dependencies. Longer-term outcomes
    will contribute to an improvement in the performance of regional teams. The Node's
    website will contribute videos, slide decks, and related materials to the NIN,
    including a 'Needs and Deals' section where local deals that seek specialized
    guidance will be advertised. The website will also post bios and contact information
    for vetted mentors who can assist companies in other regions of the country."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on improving human handling and understanding of information contained in long and complex documents. Drawing upon NSF-funded research in digital libraries which apply information retrieval and artificial intelligence techniques (such as natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning), this project will evaluate whether such technologies (with a particular focus on summarization) can lead to new business opportunities within both the insurance and legal industry. One connection between these industries is the sharing of long, often complex, documents. Integrating summarization methods with information retrieval, and further leveraging text analysis and mining technologies, could aid these businesses in more quickly and efficiently managing such documents. More broadly, the problem of creating a useful summary for a long document is applicable to many businesses, including the publishing industry, where the proposed technology could assist both authors and readers, as well as those involved in discovering, searching, and managing published document collections.

    This I-Corps project will address how advanced digital library methods can be improved and applied in commercial settings. An important service to aid with managing and understanding information is summarization. While there has been recent automation of extractive (e.g., selecting a set of the most important sentences from a document) and abstractive (e.g., automatically preparing an abstract as would be done by a human abstracter) summarization methods, as applied to news articles or other short but popular works, only extractive methods have yielded much real success when applied to longer documents. Devising and validating effective techniques for constructing abstractive summaries for long documents is a very difficult problem, which is a key focus of this project's efforts. Further, making those techniques work with complex documents in a variety of domains is a special challenge. Connecting such efforts with big data collections, online cloud systems, explainable artificial intelligence methods, and functional user interfaces, are additional challenges that must be addressed in new settings that are of commercial interest.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    to address the growing challenge of mitigating global warming and air quality
    deterioration as a result of the present energy supply ecosystem. This challenge
    is further exacerbated by periods of economic prosperity due to an increase in
    energy consumption. With the power generation sector being the biggest consumer
    of primary energy and one of the largest contributors to greenhouse and air pollutant
    emissions worldwide, an accelerated deployment of renewable energy is needed.
    However, due to renewables' intermittency as an energy source, there is a need
    for solutions that provide a flexible and reliable supply at a competitive efficiency
    while also aligning with global efforts to decarbonize the economy. Today, this
    challenge is partially met with addition of distributed natural gas fired capacity,
    motivating natural gas usage to nearly double in the last two decades. This project
    will focus on a solution to provide flexible and benchmark efficient power while
    generating zero atmospheric emissions. This not only supports environmental efforts,
    but also aligns with basic economics, making it an appealing case for carbon capture
    where both the consumer and producer benefit. \n\nThis I-Corp project will explore
    the commercial potential of a novel power solution based on the increasingly common
    reciprocating engine, by which its efficiency is radically increased and both
    air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Current solutions with
    traditional gas turbines and reciprocating engines fail to address air quality
    concerns by emitting high volumes of particulate matter and nitrous oxides. Efficiency
    benchmark technologies such as combined cycle gas turbines are unable to follow
    power demand fluctuations, nor are they able to cost effectively reduce their
    carbon footprint through carbon capture measures. This project will potentially
    address the unmet need for simultaneously flexible, efficient and clean power
    by proposing a retrofit technology that provides a transition into a utility scale
    hydrogen energy storage solution.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    This I-Corps project will impact a range of healthcare industry jobs, increasing financial efficiency and reduce data-driven misdiagnosis and mistreatment.  Healthcare patient outcomes and experiences will improve with reductions in medication errors, misdiagnosis, and other inaccuracies that can cause harm to patients and create liability issues with healthcare providers.  Processes associated with acquiring electronic health data are often function slowly, incompletely, and often without the full consent of the patient or adequate metadata to track critical information required for treating a patient.  The solution developed here can potentially enable proper data correctness and address inconsistencies which can lead to better patient outcomes and improve legal liability framework.

    This I-Corps project provides intellectual merits that will improve the healthcare information industry. This includes synthesis of mathematical models and algorithms that analyze data completeness and consistency. Specifically, this will lead to a hybrid machine learning approach that will utilize unsupervised learning to automatically classify various electronic health records as complete or incomplete, and supervised learning to confirm such classification and further grade the likelihood that the entered data is accurate and correct.  Furthermore, this will also lead to evolutions in applications of reinforcement learning supporting greater accuracy, and anomaly detection. Overall, this project will lead to improving the quality of healthcare delivery and innovations in supporting evolutions in data science.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the adoption of a new standard for assessing the real-time condition of soil and geomaterials. The occurrence of extreme weather fluctuations and natural disasters have the potential to permanently disrupt modern society and agricultural practices by increasing soil erosion and decreasing usable land, soil fertility, and resistance to pests and disease. Growing populations will place more demand on agricultural production despite constrained amounts of available land. Technologies that assist with better nutrient management, planting, and harvesting techniques will aid in sustainable food production. Additionally, the need for better soil characterization and monitoring techniques are required in light of prominent failures of mine tailings dams. The safety of mining and large earth construction operations may be improved with the adoption of real-time, remote measurements of geomaterials. Lastly, more frequent and intense wildfires have led to more post-wildfire debris flows.  Dangers associated with the debris flow potential must be identified and characterized.  The optical, non-contact remote measurement technology that will be explored in this project has the potential to impact society as well as several markets and industries, ranging from precision agriculture to mining, hazard mitigation, and construction.

    This I-Corps project will explore the applications of optical infrared technology.  The specific technology that will be explored was developed at the bench and field scale to remotely measure soil properties. The proposed innovation will advance agricultural and geotechnical engineering practices by enabling remote measurements of soil/crop condition and fertility, as well as static and dynamic soil parameters. Prior to the development of this technology, no method existed to remotely measure soil suction in the field. Because the measurements do not require contact with the soil, nor the collection of soil or water samples, the measurements are non-destructive. Furthermore, the rapidly collected measurements obtained will include many data points over a large area, improving spatial and temporal resolution over conventional point-wise data collection methods. The need to install labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive in situ instrumentation is then eliminated. The proposed technology also has the potential to save time and costs associated with conventional laboratory classification of soil properties and may also improve upon the poor reproducibility of some conventional testing methods.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve neural cell culture assays, thus furthering the research and development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. To enable the development of new therapies, there is a need for better functional control of long-term, physiologically relevant in vitro models that are translatable to the clinic and ultimately increase treatment efficacy and mitigate patient risk. While many components are necessary for a physiologically relevant model, one key area of concern is the substrate upon which neural cells are grown. In vitro cell culture platforms using substrates such as matrigel and recombinant human laminin can result in aggregation and delamination of cultured neurons within a week. The synthetic polymer substrate we are developing is designed to promote neural cell attachment and reduce delamination, enabling long-term culture and functional analysis of the cells. Furthermore, a defined substrate formulation is desirable for maintaining cell culture consistency that is expected to yield more homogenous neural cell populations, which is an advantage over animal-derived substrates.

    This I-Corps project will focus on the commercial potential of novel synthetic polymers upon which neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can grow, expand, and differentiate into neural cell lineages. The proposed product is expected to enable enhanced neural cell attachment, while maintaining viability and functionality for long-term cell culture applications. The synthetic substrate is a poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG)-based polymer that can be mechanically modulated to alter its physical properties. Additionally, bioactive modifications that mimic the native cellular microenvironment can be incorporated to enhance functionality. A key feature of this polymer is that chemical and mechanical properties are preserved across different synthesis protocols, significantly reducing the risk of batch-to-batch variability, which is a major concern with commercially available natural substrates such as matrigel. The synthetic polymer system has previously been used to enhance the attachment of other stem cell-derived cultures such as endothelial cells and preliminary data suggest that it will support stem cell-derived NPC culture.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project accrues from the cloud manufacturing capabilities of increasing sophistication that it enables. These capabilities range from platforms to improve user access to manufacturing resources to enterprise visibility platforms, supply network management systems, and cloud technology-driven manufacturing marketplaces/exchanges. This project fosters local innovation by enabling networks of easily accessible maker labs and other manufacturing resources. The project can also potentially provide economic development agencies a tool for assessing local manufacturing capability and capacity as well as measuring manufacturing activity through analysis of the in-flow and out-flow of transactions in the system.

    This I-Corps project creates a cloud platform to provide manufacturing resources with a secure network presence. The project implements a kernel based on a resource-transaction model for manufacturing resources, and surrounds it with services to enable several features, including:  a) Network visibility of its capabilities, availability, configuration and state;  b) Transaction services, including queue management, calendar, scheduler and transaction processing for initiating and executing jobs;  c) User services for authenticating users and managing access and privileges on resources;  d) IoT services for gathering and manipulating data streams originating at a resource, and secure distribution to authenticated end-points;  e) Connectivity to a curated store of cloud software applications for enhancing its visibility and usability to broad classes of users.  With these services and its use of well-established shop-floor connectivity protocols, this platform simplifies the complex tasks of creating and managing cyber-physical manufacturing networks of interacting manufacturing resources or internal/external manufacturing clouds.

    to enhance wind farm output by increasing the annual energy production through
    advanced turbine wake-control technologies. This will further enhance the benefits
    of wind energy and provide guidance in overcoming its challenges. According to
    the DOE's Wind Vision Report, wind power can be a cost-effective renewable energy
    source. At the land-based utility-scale, wind is one of the lowest-priced energy
    sources available today. It has employed 100,000 workers in 2016 and by 2050 it
    is expected to employ 600,000 workers. Furthermore, researchers estimate that
    wind power generation in 2013 reduced power-sector water consumption by 36.5 billion
    gallons. It has reduced the direct power sector carbon dioxide emission by 115
    million metric tons, sulfur dioxide emission by 157,000 metric tons, and nitrogen
    oxides by 97,000 metric tons in 2013 alone. Searching the product-market fit will
    improve the possibility of incorporating wake-control technologies in the marketplace.
    Additional applications of this technology can be found in naval defense, where
    submarine wakes should be concealed, as well as airline traffic control, where
    airplane wakes need to be dispersed rapidly. \n\nThis I-Corps project technology
    utilizes instantaneous wake location as a feedback input to a closed-loop control
    algorithm that manipulates available turbine parameters (such as pitch, speed,
    and power control) to steer the wake to a desired location. Individual wind turbine
    wake is a fundamental building block of the complex flow structure in a wind farm.
    It has been observed that an upwind turbine wake reduces downwind turbine power
    generation by 40%. As a result, wake control or manipulation provides an unprecedented
    opportunity to improve wind farm output as a whole, in contrast to the limited
    benefits of improving individual turbine efficiency. Texas Tech University's wake
    control algorithm can be incorporated in existing wind farms and can function
    by altering existing control parameters. This technology has been tested at the
    wind-tunnel based Hyper Accelerated Wake Kinematics Simulation (HAWKS) platform.
    The HAWKS platform is capable of emulating full-scale wake detection and steering.
    Such wake steering would potentially increase power generated by downwind turbines,
    increasing wind farm power generation as a whole. This increase in power generation
    increases revenue potential, especially in a grid-price bidding scenario for a
    low wind speed forecast.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a novel, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly solution for production improvement in oil, gas, geothermal, and groundwater reservoirs. Fracking/stimulation is a required step after drilling to increase permeability and get access to the trapped geofluid in sedimentary and rock formations. This method provides an alternative or complimentary reservoir permeability enhancement solution to current high-pressure water/acid injection-based method such as hydraulic or acid fracking. This proposed innovation will allow for an economical permeability increase without water contamination and induced seismic activities. Furthermore, this method will alleviate the demand in water stressed areas.

    This I-Corps project will identify the commercial potential for developing a novel Electric Reservoir Stimulation (ERS) method that increases reservoir permeability for petroleum and geothermal applications, without requiring pumping material into the subsurface. This method will consist of controlled high voltage electrical pulses applied in two electrodes placed at the depth of interest between wells. In this method, the conductivity of the geofluid along with the pulse discharge parameters (amplitude, width, frequency), and treatment time will determine the effect on the permeability of the reservoir rock. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within pores. We're performing experimental analysis in our lab on different core samples to see the effects of the proposed electric treatment. Additionally, numerical simulations are used to predict the effect of proposed method and power requirements in reservoir scale.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve patient outcomes by bringing whole brain imaging directly to the patient for safe, fast, and better tolerated diagnostics. Compared to existing brain imaging technologies, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) helmet brain imager overcomes limitations related to radioactive dose, portability, motion tolerance and cost. The lower dose required by the device permits screening or longitudinal monitoring of patients in various cases, such as brain injury, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, addition and other neurological and mental health disorders. The portable nature allows bedside imaging directly in patient rooms, as well as onsite imaging in military and athletic settings, including immediately after head injuries. The device's motion tolerance helps address hospital inefficiency and extra cost from rescanning patients due to movement artifacts, and the discomfort of remaining still, especially for elderly and injured patients. The low cost and small footprint compared to standard PET/CT systems, results in a device with utility beyond just large medical facilities, as it can be used in smaller rural clinics, sporting/military medical facilities, and in research studies of previously difficult to study brain functions.

    This I-Corps Project will help bring the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Helmet brain imager into use by clinics, sporting/ army medical centers, and research institutions. The instrument is a ring of detectors that can be placed around the head of a patient to non-invasively provide information of activity in different brain regions. This device requires only 10-25% of the typical clinical PET radiation dose due to the close proximity of the detectors to the patient's head, and published data show high efficiency and sensitivity of the detectors using industry standard testing. Moreover, the PET Helmet system can be transported to the desired location of imaging scanner, and a current research project involves testing the imager bedside for human patients with traumatic brain injury. The device moves with the head of the patient allowing for motion tolerance as well as upright imaging, and we have demonstrated appropriate task-related brain imaging during an upright walking task in human participants.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    the increased mobility, and thereby, social integration for people with ankle
    control deficit. Mobility is associated with functional independence and participation
    in society. Sufficient ankle control plays a vital role in mobility. A significant
    portion of populations with neuromuscular disorders, such as children with cerebral
    palsy (CP) and post-stroke survivals, live with insufficient ankle control. Our
    design, DEAFO, is a soft mechanized brace to help these individuals to walk easier
    and longer. DEAFO will provide assistance and correction about the ankle while
    preventing discomfort, to promote mobility and improve the quality of life of
    the users.  The project will first focus on the CP population (~700,000 in US),
    which is the most common motor disorder in children. CP's total economic burden,
    in direct and indirect costs, is $11.5 billion per year, in the US alone. A significant
    portion of this cost consists of assistive devices and physical training, needed
    due to insufficient ankle control. Hence, DEAFO will aim to provide both ankle
    assistance and physical training to promote motor recovery, which potentially
    decreases these costs over time. The company's ultimate goal is to expand DEAFO
    applications to post-stroke population (~8 million in US). \n\nThis I-Corps project
    will be the first light-weight, noiseless, soft, and mechanized ankle foot orthoses
    (AFO), that deploy dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. Thus, it
    is called DEAFO. Increased chance of falls, and inefficient walking speed, are
    major consequences of ankle-control deficit. Although this is a common disorder
    in a population of 8 to 10 million, the status of care for this pathology, usually,
    is a rudimentary, bulky, rigid uncomfortable AFO. Furthermore, the none-mechanized
    AFOs hold the ankle fixed at specific angles, and cause secondary problems, such
    as disuse atrophy of the muscles. DEAFO will be mechanized by dielectric elastomer
    (DE)-based artificial muscle. The novel DE actuators are soft, lightweight, compact,
    and acoustically noiseless, with muscle-like behaviors, which is benchmark tested
    in the company's lab. The softness and noiseless operation of these artificial
    muscles will substantially improve the comfort and natural feel of the device
    in comparison with other mechanized AFOs. Unlike most mechanized AFOs, the controller
    that will drive the artificial muscles in the device has been specifically developed
    and evaluated for pathological walking and showed 100% detection reliability in
    children with CP. This project can revolutionize the status of care for ankle-control
    deficit.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy
    of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies primarily in its ability to stimulate growth across multiple industries. The membrane filtration technology developed allows for the separation of components of interest and value in the oil & gas, food & beverage, life sciences, textiles, and semiconductor manufacturing spaces in a more efficient manner than the methods in use today. By replacing these more expensive and energy intensive processes, the technology can provide a significant cost savings to the industrial end user, thereby generating surplus revenue, increased hiring capacity, and facilitating growth. In addition, the project will yield a societal benefit by providing a more effective and energy efficient approach for industrial process separations and wastewater treatment.

    This I-Corps project further develops a robust membrane filtration technology. The membrane consists of commonly available thin-sheet silicon through which nanoscale pores are chemically etched using a simple patented process. These pores extend from one side of the silicon sheet to the other, thereby acting as channels through which water can flow. Molecules, particles, and other constituents of interest are rejected both by the physical size of the pores, and by the chemical character of the membrane surface, allowing for the removal, concentration, or separation of important components. The membrane offers a unique value proposition in that it combines a very small size cutoff offered by polymeric filters with the harsh environment compatibility of ceramic filters, while possessing excellent resistance to clogging and blockage. These properties enable low maintenance separation performance in a wide range of industrial applications where exposure to harsh environments such as high or low pH, organic solvents, and high temperatures is required.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the clinical utilization of cancer chemotherapy drugs by reducing toxic side effects and improving the therapeutic index. The key technology is based on the controlled release of chemo-drugs in response to tumor acidosis. The initial product is an acid-sensitive prodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a prominent chemo-drug commonly used in the treatment of breast, bladder, and other cancers (including the childhood cancers Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma). The current global annual market for Dox is ~$800M (~$400M in the US). Treatments of solid tumors that are likely to be acidic account for ~60-70% of Dox applications in the clinic. The Dox global market is projected to reach $1.38B by 2024. This pH-sensitive prodrug of Dox may be considered an improved version of Dox for treating acidic solid tumors. Also, this technology could be expanded to other chemo-drugs outside of the anthracycline class. Furthermore, acidic microenvironments are found not only in cancerous tumors, but also in other disease states, such as sites of inflammation and the ischemic myocardium during heart attacks, which represent other potential targets of the pH-sensitive prodrug technology in the future.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology for improving the safety profile of chemo-drugs by suppressing drug release at healthy tissues, while preferentially releasing drugs at tumor sites. The targeted drug release would be triggered by tumor acidosis. Due to rapid growth, many cancerous tumors have extracellular pH (pHe) in the range of 6.5-6.9, compared with pHe of 7.2-7.4 in healthy tissues. Tumor acidosis can be considered as a universal biomarker of the cancer microenvironment and correlates with poor prognosis (i.e., more acidic tumors are usually found in more aggressive cancers). To turn tumor acidosis against cancer, this team developed ultra-acid-sensitive, small molecule prodrugs to selectively release Dox in response to acidic tumor pHe. The critical challenge of developing an ultra-sensitive pH biosensor that can distinguish between pHe 7.4 and 6.7 has been met from the basic science side by using an acid-sensitive linker. Preliminary data indicate that these prodrugs can release ~ 4-fold more Dox at pH 6.7 vs. 7.4 in cell culture settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the routine clinic-based diagnosis and treatment of patients with cognitive impairment, including various types of dementia. Given the aging of U.S. populations, and the prevalence of dementia in elderly patients, patients with cognitive impairment will be an increasing management problem in healthcare systems. This project's information system will allow primary care providers to manage complex cognitively impaired cases without needing a referral to specialists, and without needing additional provider time with patients. Primary care providers generally manage simple cases of mild cognitive impairment, and refer more complex cases to neurologists, neuropsychologists, and geriatric specialists, which can cause economic and patient-care problems. Specialty care for cognitively impaired individuals can also be sparse outside of major metropolitan areas, which causes serious challenges to the equitable delivery of health care for rural and underserved communities. Primary care providers would potentially benefit with increased revenue and better care of the patients. Patients would potentially benefit from their care being managed by fewer physicians, and have more rapid access to diagnosis and treatment. Society will potentially benefit from lower population-health costs and improved healthcare outcomes.

    This I-Corps project proposes to develop an information system to manage patients with cognitive impairment by providing primary care providers with an integrated set of evidence-based screening, diagnostic, treatment and monitoring modules. These modules will include a diagnostic test for cognitive impairment based upon computer-analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data using a new technique based upon preliminary results. Because of its low cost, rapidity, and non-invasive nature, EEG has great promise as an office-based clinical test for brain diseases. However, to date, standard techniques of EEG analysis have not been accurate enough for routine clinical use. Similarly, currently, there are no tests that are FDA-approved for assessing cognitive impairments associated with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Another strong component of this envisioned information management system will be its recommendation of care plans personalized for each patient based on artificial intelligence-based models. In addition, the information management software will have the ability to connect the patient to other local services that are often needed by patients with dementia and other brain diseases.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project involves exploring the commercial potential of cutting tool wear monitoring sensors. Cutting tool manufacturers, machine tool manufacturers, and CNC machine operating companies can potentially benefit through improved cutting tool production processes and saving tooling time needed for production. There is a potential growing industrial customer need to accurately, precisely, and inexpensively sense and diagnose cutting tool wear, damage, and/or cutting edge quality. However, there are few reliable instruments available in the market with the required accuracy, resolution, cost, and on-machine usage. The proposed sensor allows for high-resolution monitoring and diagnosis of edge quality by providing quantitative information on morphological properties, including tool edge quality and wear related to abrasion, attrition, and chipping.

    This I-Corps project bridges a knowledge gap existing between the state-of-the-art instrumentation technologies and cutting tool inspection methods. Existing methods do not typically provide a quantitative measure to monitor the health of precision cutting tools in a convenient and time/cost-effective manner. The knife-edge interferometer developed in this project allows for precision cutting tool wear measurement and monitoring by providing quantitative information on morphological properties including abrasion, attrition, and chipping. This project enables a new cutting tool wear monitoring paradigm, producing new knowledge in instrumentation and characterization. This research will create a new transformative wear diagnosis principle for precision cutting tools to improve manufacturing reliability and the automation process.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project rests in the advanced biomedical treatments that can be delivered using recombinant protein-based materials. In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces, low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and increase patient comfort.

    This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-interactive properties.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on a multifunctional morphing drone that is capable of optimizing performance through combining the capabilities of several single traditional drones.  Compared to the existing drones in the market, the introduction of a multifunctional morphing drone will potentially reduce purchasing cost and storage space,  carry large payloads, maintain flight stability, and improve the endurance. This technology will potentially be useful in applications such as agriculture, wildlife, or forestry monitoring where there are large areas that need to be covered with high performance, large payload capacity and multi-mission capabilities.

    This I-Corps project further develops a multifunctional morphing drone with spanning and sweeping capabilities. The novelty of this design originates from spanning and sweeping capability of the drone with boom stabilization during transitions. The main purpose of the offered concept is to design an optimal drone that can change its dimensions according to the defined mission. The stability in transition mode of morphing drones is one of the challenging steps for design and flight assessments. Consequently, a new concept that changes the dimensions of the wings and fuselage is proposed. This methodology can result in an improvement in the drones' performance, expansion in its flight range, enhancement of its stealth capability, reduction in drag, increase in its endurance and payload, and reduction in vibrational instability. The advantages of this design do not only come from the final expanded form, but also from the transitional phase. During the expansion of the wing, the center of gravity is independent of the increased spanning, especially in the case of an almost rectangular wing shape, which is not significantly altering the center of gravity position along the longitudinal axis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new re-use option for waste tires and, at the same time, provide an economical solution to remove siloxanes in landfill gas prior to combustion for electricity generation.  This novel technology for the treatment of landfill gas/biogas to remove siloxanes uses the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles as the adsorption media. The innovation of this technology will make electricity generation from landfill gas more sustainable and more attractive economically.  In addition, the development of a new reuse market for waste tires will reduce the burden of tire disposal across the U.S.  By providing an economical solution for siloxane control as well as creating a reuse option for waste tires, the well-being of communities near landfills will potentially be improved.

    This I-Corps project will help to propel electricity generation from landfill gas by removing one of the major obstacles to its use.  A major challenge to the use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source comes from trace contaminants, namely 'silica containing compounds' called siloxanes which are converted to silicon dioxide, a glass like substance that reduces engine efficiency, reduces heat transfer, increases scour and abrasion, and accelerates equipment deterioration.  This innovation is the development of a new siloxane adsorption process using waste tire rubber particles.  Using this approach, the siloxane nuisance in landfill gas to electricity plants will be mitigated. Currently, there are limited options for the reuse of the rubber material from waste tires.  The development of an effective adsorption process using the smallest size fraction of waste tire rubber particles represents an exciting entrepreneurial opportunity to turn this waste product into a marketable adsorbent that can compete with activated carbon adsorption for siloxane control.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly improve the prediction of drug response during preclinical testing. This will result in a potentially higher rate of FDA approvals and successful translation of drugs to the market. For example, fifteen million people in the US are burdened with cancer, yet across all drug trials, oncology drugs experience the lowest approval rate at 5.1%. A screening method that improves the predictability of drug responses in both safety and efficacy during preclinical drug testing would have a profound impact. Better drug screening methods will lead to improvements in successful clinical trial outcomes, thereby increasing the number of new drugs that are approved to enter the market. Increasing the availability of new drugs will improve treatment options for patients and increase survival rates.

    This I-Corps project will introduce a new platform technology for preclinical drug screening to evaluate multi-cellular and multi-system responses. The technology represents a significant advancement to the field of tissue engineered models for drug screening by incorporating multiple tissue-systems into a single assay that provides physiologically relevant readouts for reliable drug response prediction.  The model integrates vascular function across multiple physiological systems; multi-system readouts are important for evaluating the effects of drugs on a tissue as an integrated whole. The technology has been initially demonstrated for preclinical drug screening through the application of an anti-cancer drug that prevents the growth of blood vessels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures by sensing the radio frequency (RF) signals during interventional and diagnostic procedures. During interventional procedures, especially critical for children who cannot be imaged using X-rays, this sensor provides the location and orientation of devices, such as catheters, inside the patient's body to guide the physicians. Since an acousto-optical sensor is used, this information transfer is achieved with no adverse effects, such as RF heating. During diagnostic procedures, the sensor can help quantify the RF field exposure of the patient in real-time, preventing excessive tissue heating. Furthermore, it may enable imaging of patients with medical implants who are not currently imaged by MRI due to safety concerns. As a commercial product, the sensor will potentially decrease the costs for all the stake-holders within the health industry (hospitals, insurance companies, governmental institutions, etc.) while decreasing the risk to the patients and improving health outcomes.

    This I-Corps project is based on a radio frequency (RF) safe acousto-optical sensor to locally measure the RF field in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which in turn provides the signals to track the interventional devices like catheters and needles during interventional procedures under MRI as well as to measure RF energy exposure of the patient. The main safety concern with MRI is RF heating due to metal cables required to carry the signal from an antenna to the outside system. The solution here is replacing all the metal cables with optical glass fiber, which eliminates the RF heating. To convert the RF signal into optical modulation, a compact acousto-optic sensor is used as an intermediate medium between the antenna and the optical fiber. This is achieved by exciting a piezoelectric transducer on an optical fiber with the RF signal generated by miniature MRI coils and antennas which in turn generates acoustic waves in the optical fiber. Since the signal is generated and transmitted over an optical fiber to the MRI system without any conductors, this eliminates the RF heating safety issue. The sensor prototype has been successfully bench tested and proof of principle for interventional procedures has been demonstrated.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is focused on a smart technology that will help smart tethering between elements of social dyads such as parents/infants, caregivers/ patients, or even owners/pets.  Given a complex set of scenarios in which such dyads operate, in some subset of scenarios alerts must be generated, while in other complex scenarios no alerts should be generated.  This project employs machine learning techniques to propose a robust technology that minimizes false alarm rate.  The system will automatically learn about the environment (unsupervised learning) to minimize the false alarm rate.  The smart tethering system consists of hardware and smart software algorithms. Possible applications include child monitoring, patient monitoring and possibly other safety-motivated interventions.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a smart tethering technology that integrates sensors, computing platforms, and artificial intelligence. The proposed technology implements a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and deep learning approaches to model the environment to minimize the response error.  Initially the system is trained with training data (GA coupled with deep learning) and then deployed in user's environment.  After deployment, the system smartly learns complex scenarios and customizes to the user's environment based on unsupervised learning approach. The project builds upon prior work in hardware development for smart adaptive systems.   In general, for smart solutions, researchers mostly have employed supervised learning (training based) due to its simplicity. If this research is successful, it will advance the state-of-the-art in the unsupervised learning approach as well as GA based smart systems.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves improvement in the time and cost associated with training needed to prepare data analysts working in research fields outside of academia. Knowledge of statistical methods often does not translate to application to current research questions. The proposed project aims to reduce the time corporations and large and small organizations need in training new data analyst employees. Additionally, the project aims to reduce errors in judgment regarding the application of appropriate statistical tests to particular problems. Commercially, the project may replace libraries of statistical reference manuals utilized to make decisions about application of statistical models.

    This I-Corps project leverages academic research in statistics to application in real-world research contexts such as data analysis in medical research centers. The project is designed to assist quantitative data analysts in moving from hypothesis to interpretation of statistical results through a simple series of decision steps, using parameters known to analysts across a variety of contexts. The prototype was built using a puzzle/maze typology. Current market available tools are limited in scope of statistical tests, and do not provide demonstration of the test in action with hypothetical data. The current project prototype covers 28 different parametric and non-parametric statistical tests appropriate across all four quantitative data types: categorical, ordinal, interval, and ratio-level data. Additionally, the current prototype provides demonstration of all 28 tests via video-link using sample data, provide output results, and demonstration of appropriate reporting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the technology (robotic hardware and data analytic software) has the potential to be developed into a new product as a complete, self-contained robotic inspection tool that carries a RGB-depth camera and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor with vertical mobility for detecting surface flaws and sub-surface defects. The use of the tool will allow the inspection of human-built structures to be performed significantly faster, more thoroughly and at a lower cost by eliminating the need for scaffolding or blocking traffic. It will also improve inspection safety and speed which leads to more frequent and on-demand inspections, thus making the national infrastructure more secure.

    This I-Corps project has the following innovations: 1) novel design of robotic inspection system carrying a RGB-depth camera to detect surface flaws, and a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensor to detect sub-surface defects on both ground and vertical surfaces that other robots cannot do; 2) a novel method that enable the robot to scan the surface in an arbitrary trajectory with accurate positioning and integrate the control with GPR signal processing to identify areas of delamination and locate subsurface embedment (rebar, pipes, fractures, voids, delamination, etc.) in concrete structures that will revolutionize the way GPR data is interpreted and displayed. The value proposition of the robotic inspection system includes: 1) automating the vision/GPR data collection process with minimal human intervention; 2) simplifying the robot control to scan the surface in an arbitrary trajectory; 3) making inspection results easy to understand by non-professionals; 4) and improving the inspection speed and accuracy.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it will enable artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) solutions to be implemented in embedded and remote devices. It provides the means to make any camera, remote sensor, or detector truly intelligent and capable of discernment and prediction; any device that has already been electronically equipped will have the potential to utilize decision making intellect. It will be a catalyst in making AI/ML truly ubiquitous and a commodity of the human experience. Intelligent sensors will help make the world safer, cameras will be able to detect anomalies and alert authorities before tragedies, and detectors will be able to predict emergencies instead of simply telemetering data. Economically, through human assistance, embedded AI/ML will enable society to be more efficient and produce greater yield.  This has the potential to be a transformative technology that impacts multiple levels of society.

    This I-Corps project further develops an implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) directly as a hardware circuit. AI/ML have revolutionized several technical industries such as voice recognition, image processing, healthcare, and personalized advertisements. AI/ML operates by training a mathematical model, often a combination of non-linear functions, to make inferences about the model's environment. However, AI/ML has been primarily restricted to cloud-based applications with large quantities of computing resources. In contrast, this technology implements the AI/ML model as hardware circuit that fits within a single integrated circuit. This project builds off previous technical accomplishments that implemented software design principles, such as extensibility, service-oriented architecture, modularity, and loose coupling, in hardware design through software assisted compilation. Creating a software aid to automatically restructure the hardware design enabled the hardware to change much more dynamically according to a series of parameters. By applying similar techniques to AI/ML, the technology will be able deconstruct and analyze the AI/ML model, and through a series of algorithms construct a matching hardware circuit.

    The broader impact/commercial potentials of this I-Corps project is the advancement of safe, next generation lithium batteries that can power electric vehicles with driving ranges in excess of 300 miles, and store intermittent energy generated by wind and solar sources. Replacement of volatile, flammable liquid electrolytes now used in lithium ion batteries with safe solid electrolytes is the goal of many existing and future battery technologies. The development of such a solid electrolyte separator has broad applications in many economic sectors and to companies developing lithium ion, lithium metal, lithium sulfur (LiS) and lithium air batteries. The technology can be applicable to many lithium ion conducting ceramics, protecting them from contact with lithium metal and water, and enabling them to be bonded with polymer electrolytes, so that composites can be formed that are processible and compatible with existing manufacturing processes or technologies to make batteries.

    This I-Corps project addresses several critical problems that hinder the development of all solid state lithium batteries. It is a technology that merges the beneficial characteristics of both lithium ion conducting ceramics and organic polymer electrolytes. Lithium ion conducting ceramics can have high conductivity, wide electrochemical stability windows and moduli that in principle suppress the growth of dendrites, but are brittle and not easily incorporated into full cells. Polymer electrolytes have good processibility, can be easily incorporated into battery cells and have better compatibility with electrodes, but have low ionic conductivity. The technology merges these two materials using silica "glue" that adheres well to the ceramic and can be functionalized to be compatible with the polymer component. This has been demonstrated using the sandwich geometry of polymer/ceramic/polymer, showing that there is low interfacial resistance between the two components. When nanometer layers are applied to ceramic particles, composites with polymers or polymer gels can be formed with the desirable properties of both components.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve food and health product safety in the US.  This can reduce the economic burden associated with disease and infection caused by bacteria on surfaces.  The proposed technology can be used to determine adherence to cleaning protocols that are used to keep food and healthcare facilities safe.  It can also be used to help monitor chronic wounds, thus reducing the number of clinical visits for routine status check-ups.  The ability to conduct real time measurement of biofilms in a closed environment is currently unavailable in the market.  This technology can potentially impact food safety and also health care markets.

    This I-Corps project will further develop a wireless sensor platform technology that is proposed for use in monitoring growth of biofilms or fluid build-up in closed systems such as bandages or on surfaces such as food preparation areas or healthcare counters. The sensor is a platform technology that consists of a flexible sensor, a reader, and algorithm to translate the wireless signal.  The sensor is a planar, Archimedean coil that is an open circuit inductor capacitor that forms a resonant structure.  It can be placed on or in surface materials or bandages.  As cells or a biofilm grow on the surface of the resonator, this changes the local dielectric and a large shift in the resonant frequency is observed.  This can be sampled wirelessly using a vector network analyzer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide an extra layer of security protection for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by using a novel hardware-based intrusion detection system. In today's defense-in-depth security strategy, all available security controls are placed in series aiming to protect a device from malicious cyber-physical attack.  Market research estimates that the IoT market will reach over $500B by 2021 and security is considered one of the biggest barriers in adopting IoT.  One main reason of this security concern is due to the limited resource of IoT devices that makes it difficult to apply all layers of security protections. The adoption of the proposed approach will provide additive security layer to the IoT devices that will boost the confidence in IoT device security in cameras, drones, sensors and others. Consequently, it may induce new industries which have previously been reluctant to apply IoT solutions to their businesses. Due to the small resource occupation of the proposed device security, even non-IoT industries may apply the proposed approach to their security applications.

    This I-Corps project applies Stochastic Computing (SC) to provide hardware Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) security solution for resource limited IoT devices. Current approaches to IoT security cannot provide HIDS solution to these resource constraint IoT devices, thereby missing out from one of the important layers in defense-in-depth security strategy. The proposed approach exploited two salient properties of SC: 1) consumption of less silicon area and power, 2) both SC and HIDS are inherently probabilistic in nature. SC is generated probabilistically from conventional number system that can perform complex mathematical operation using simple hardware blocks. The proposed approach provides IoT devices with HIDS based on simple hardware together with Machine Learning Neural Network Algorithm. Coupled with other security layers such as cryptography, access control etc., this light weight hardware solution provides strong security to the resource limited IoT devices. Embedded inside the IoT device, this HIDS monitors the incoming packets for any malicious activity and offers the last important layer of security defense.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to revolutionize the music industry and related sectors such as game development and video production which significantly involve music. With the proposed music generation technology, copyright issues can be avoided since the music generated is completely original. Furthermore, compared to traditional composing methods which take at least an hour for the user or composer to produce a one-minute piece of music, the proposed technology spends only less than a minute to generate the music of the same length. These advantages will allow small game developers and self-media producers to generate original music that fit to their needs in a very short amount of time with minimum cost, which significantly benefits the game and self-media industries.

    This I-Corps project features the technology of automatic music generation from user's humming based on AI and music theory. Without any professional knowledge of music, a user can simply start by humming a short melody. Combining the AI algorithm with music theory, the application completes other necessary musical components (such as chord progression, beats and tempo) and expands the short input melody into a full piece of music for which the user can change genre and do post-editing. The technical differentiators of the proposed technology are threefold. Firstly, a pitch detection algorithm is developed to recognize the user's humming tune and turn it into musical notes, which are then optimized to conform to music theory and logic. Secondly, a novel algorithm combining Recurrent Neural Network and music theory is developed to generate a full piece of music, including the main melody, chord progression, motive and accompaniment, based on the user's short input melody. Thirdly, the post editing stage allows the user to modify the notes and genre according to the generated chord progression.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to integrate novel and established wearable physiological sensors, machine learning and an adaptable exercise-training algorithm to optimize performance and minimize risk of injury or overtraining. Professional and collegiate teams face significant problems due to injuries, overexertion (rhabdomyolysis) and exertional heat illness (EHI).  Nearly half of these issues are avoidable via proper management and training. In elite athletes, achieving the balance of over or undertraining remains difficult and elusive. Elite and professional athletes, and their coaches, sports scientists, and elite team trainers require the most precise assessment and management of training and performance and the cost of failure is much greater. With success in this population, this innovation can potentially be adaptable to fitness and wellness applications where precision is less important, and efficiency and motivation is more highly valued. For chronic disease management applications, precision, physiological monitoring, instant feedback, and exercise progression become vitally important.

    This I-Corps project seeks to enable real-time and continuous monitoring of physiological responses to exercise training using a custom sensor array, adaptable speed-endurance training algorithm and integrated machine learning to create an optimal, individualized exercise-training program for peak performance and minimize injury in elite and professional athletes. Currently, the primary way in which athletes manage this lacks integration and individualization of physiological data to workload in order to prevent overtraining during the exercise session.  To date, there have been few standardized and progressive non-steady state training programs that can adjust a program to a specific individual. Using real-time novel and established physiological sensors with machine learning, the training algorithm has the capability to adapt a workout to an individual's specific physiological responses. A novel sensor developed for this project has proven effective in preliminary testing.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project will be to address an unmet need to identify and alarm for all seizure types. More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition.  To reduce the risk of injury or death, neurologists frequently recommend caregivers constantly monitor patients, resulting in co-sleeping, significant changes in work and family schedules, and a substantial loss of independence. However, even under monitored conditions, caregivers fail to recognize more than 50% of seizures, resulting in sub-optimal treatment. Although technology is available to detect seizures in clinical settings, the necessary equipment is not currently suitable for continuous use in daily living.  The development and validation of technology to detect and alert patients and caregivers to all types of seizures in a non-clinical setting would have substantial benefits for timely treatment, improve patient outcomes, and improve patient and caregiver quality of life.

    This I-Corps project further develops a core technology that uses analysis of eye movements to provide a reliable, reproducible means of identifying seizure activity. The team is developing wearable eye-tracking technology and software suitable for identifying all seizure types during wakefulness and sleep. This work will significantly advance understanding of seizures through rigorous mathematical analysis of eye movements which previously has been only qualitatively described. The core technology analyzes eye movements, known as oculometrics, to detect seizures.  The goal is to transform how at-risk individuals and caregivers identify and respond to seizures, potentially reducing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and improving quality of life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is by improving the quality of life of prostate and potentially other pelvic cancer patients who receive radiation therapy (RT). Followed by skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society's estimate for prostate cancer in the United States for 2018 was 164,690 new cases. Most of these cases will receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment. The new trend in RT is to deliver a much higher dose of radiation per fraction in a smaller number of fractions while reducing the required number of RT sessions. However, during RT of the prostate, the rectum acts as a limiting factor. Due to the proximity of rectum to prostate, increasing dosage of the radiation can affect the rectal wall and increase risk of cancer in rectum. The device developed here allows for the expedited treatment plans while eliminating the undesirable damage to the rectal tissue.  This can greatly improve a patient's quality of life after completion of radiation treatment. The use of our device reduces the overall required time for the radiation therapy of prostate cancer and saves money for health care providers, health insurances, and patients.

    This I-Corps project leverages the functionality of nickel titanium to retract the rectum away from the prostate during radiation beam therapy of prostate cancer. This will be a minimally invasive device that uses the biomimetic actuation of the material to create distance between rectum and prostate. NiTi as a biocompatible shape memory alloy is an ideal candidate for biomimetic and biocompatible devices. A control systems design is combined with thermomechanical functionality of the alloy to generate the desired range of motion and profile of force. The actuation takes place by passing a small electrical current in a reliable, clean, and silent manner. This type of actuation is potentially inherently safer when compared to most other means of actuation, because it has a limited range of motion beyond which applying more electrical current does not create further motion.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to potentially provide a solution that will enable the furniture industry to address the issue of blood flow associated with prolonged sitting. The commercialization of the technology will potentially impact the lives of individuals who sit for prolonged periods of time, especially in the office work environment. This technology will steer the industry in a new direction using science and technology to address an important issue -- venous blood flow issue resulting from prolonged sitting.

    This I-Corps project further develops a seating solution to address the issue of blood flow associated with prolonged sitting. Millions of individuals work in office and administrative support occupations. Most of these individuals spend majority of their working time sitting. With prolonged sitting there is immobility in the lower extremities which could result in venous blood flow issues and in some cases pulmonary embolism.  The innovation is a seating solution with a seat that is split so there are two parts on the bottom that could move separately by pushing down on a lever and individuals could move their legs up and down. This proposed technology is valuable to any organization where individuals sit and work because of improved blood flow and perceived comfort which lead to greater satisfaction and increased productivity in work.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to potentially replace reduce the costs of solar panel, enabling wider spread adoption.  Solar panel manufacturing depends heavily on conductive pastes in the manufacture of the conductive busbars and finger grids on the top of solar panels, with the market potential for the conductive pastes being currently estimated to be about $2 billion and its growth at a CAGR of 4%.  With silver components accounting for close to 20% of the current photovoltaic solar cell costs, 100-fold cheaper copper pastes can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost.  New materials developments have led to increases in copper paste sales and usages. Commercialization of this technology offers an opportunity to accelerate the demand for solar panels by supplying high-performance conductive pastes to solar panel manufacturers at attractive prices.

    This I-Corps project focuses on determining the commercialization feasibility of a high performance and low-cost copper nanowire paste technology to help photovoltaic solar panel manufacturers who suffer from the pain of high-cost silver paste that requires high processing temperature and is subject to corrosion of silver grid fingers to degrade the electrical performance. Customer discovery will be performed to test a number of initial hypotheses, identify the market opportunity, and develop the business model.  Manufacturing of silicon-based solar cells involves screen printing of conductive silver pastes as front electrodes to provide good contact and efficient electrical performance. Major barriers include high cost of silver, high-temperature manufacturing process and corrosion of silver grid fingers. These barriers will be overcome by using new copper nanowire pastes that are sinterable and oxidation-resistant at room temperature for manufacturing highly conductive electrodes on solar panels.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to minimize the risk of pressure ulcer formation in wheelchair users. In addition, this project will reduce the labor and cost associated with treating and preventing ulcers. Pressure ulcers are serious injuries that afflict those who are may already be suffering from other ailments such as paralysis and diabetes. They are often overlooked until it is too late, posing serious morbidity and mortality risk. Pressure ulcer prevention is a continuous job, and treatment of established ulcers is costly. Caretakers must constantly check, adjust, and turn at-risk wheelchair bound patients for the duration of the day. This is even more problematic with the nationwide staffing shortage in nursing homes. The most effective available cushions are cost prohibitive for most at-risk individuals and care facilities. Moreover, cushions that are widely used are prone to breaking, resulting in reoccurring costs and the need to reestablish constant care. Aside from the facilities and individuals who are affected, insurance companies in the US spend over $11 billion in treatment of ulcers every year and ulcers are the 2nd largest cause of medical malpractice lawsuits in the US.

    This I-Corps project will develop a new wheelchair cushion that can minimize pressure ulcer onset. Prolonged sitting can lead to extreme discomfort, the breakdown of skin tissue, and the development of pressure ulcers. Strategies to mitigate this issue are based primarily on the principles of immersion and offloading. Immersion is the process of distributing interfacial pressure evenly across a surface. This is normally achieved with a foam or air cushion. Offloading is the process of suspending a specific region of the body in the air to remove and or redistribute pressure. To date, traditional strategies are ineffective in managing pressure ulcers. Immersion techniques can only reduce pressure magnitudes. Offloading cushions result in increased pressure and risk of pressure ulcer formation at support sites. This project develops a cushion that utilizes targeted offloading of high-risk areas to remove pressure alongside cyclic alternating pressure to prevent prolonged tissue deformation in non-offloaded sites. Furthermore, the rechargeable battery powered cushion is compact and quiet, so it does not interfere with a user's daily life.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to fill a void in the products and services that teach language to children with autism and to non-native English speakers. Approximately one-third of individuals with autism exhibit a deficit in expressing themselves in sentences. The traditional language remediation for autism is in-person therapy. Computerized therapies offer more intensive instruction at lower cost, but existing programs do not fully address the language deficits seen in autism. In addition, the National Council for Education Statistics reports a population of English as a Second Language (ESL) students that grew from 8.1 percent in 2000 to 9.5 percent in 2015.  The program developed here offers both ESL and autistic students personalized, automated instruction, along with a comprehensive curriculum, in core areas of English: grammar and syntax. Mastering these requires a level of extensive practice, personalized learning, and linguistic expertise that exceeds both the capacities of in-person therapies and teacher-directed instruction, and the capabilities of the language software programs that are currently on the market.

    This I-Corps project involves the development and commercialization of an English language teaching program providing personalized instruction in sentence construction.  Informed by research showing that mastering a language requires active practice, the system uses pictures and verbal prompts (spoken and written) to prompt learners put words together into specific types of phrases and sentences. These targeted language structures gradually increase in length and complexity. Learners construct their responses from scratch through open-ended word-button clicking, keyboard typing, or speech. The system provides interactive, step-by-step feedback (both spoken and written) that is informed by principles of explicit and implicit learning. This feedback, enhanced through color-coded highlighting, diagnoses problems with word choice, word endings, and word order, guiding users through self-corrections to well-formed sentences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a new standard of plant purity, which can have tremendous positive health consequences for the millions of worldwide consumers. The cold plasma water purification and enrichment technology, utilized in our proposed hydroponic system, can extend to other areas of agriculture as the antimicrobial chemicals produced in plasma rapidly kill pathogens and are safe for both plants and animals. The potential benefits stemming from this technology can help vertical farmers to eradicate food scarcity challenges in urban centers all over the world, powered by the sun's energy. Given the imminent, significant, and accelerating problems of agricultural sustainability and water conservation facing humanity, this technology has the potential to play a significant role in helping to preserve and sustain life on Earth as we know it. Additionally, the decrease in water volume needed for irrigation and the increased yield of plants treated with plasma-treated water also supports applications of plasma treatment in various farming and reforestation efforts. Finally, an ambitious goal for the company is to implement this technology in environments where resources other than electricity are extremely limited, such as long-term space missions.

    This I-Corps project will allow the company to better understand the needs of the company's potential customers and how plasma technology can offer solutions to the commercial agricultural market while providing technological insight to members of the hydroponic agriculture industry and opportunities for significant improvements to their existing agricultural systems and practices. Through these plasma technology commercialization efforts, the team envisions facilitating bigger, healthier, and more sustainable crop harvests for the modern farmer, while also reducing the volume of potentially harmful chemical additives, environmental damage, and wastefulness associated with current production methods. Current lab-scale research results are very promising, however, detailed analysis of the market and interviews with professional hydroponic farmers, industry experts, vendors, and customers are required to validate full-scale commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will help satisfy the growing demand in 3D capturing technology primarily caused by the need for photorealistic content for 3D applications, and better computer vision solutions for autonomous machinery. Additionally, for researchers and conservationists, 3D capturing is a way to preserve precious artifacts and study them without endangering of permanently losing them during transportation or due to natural deterioration. For retailers and designers, low cost accurate 3D representations of products are needed for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications that open new possibilities to connect with their customers. Finally, as display makers continue to improve upon light field (LF) displays, LF image and video will potentially become mainstream and a pipeline will need to exist to capture, compress, and stream this new form of media.

    This I-Corps project utilizes a specialized computer numerical control camera and compression algorithms to record multiple photos of an object or a scene and based on this raw data to construct light field (LF) images which preserve the complex interactions between the lights and the surfaces in the scene. This project develops compression and reconstruction algorithms that exploit the redundant information found in LF images while also allowing quick decompression on viewing devices (applicable for web, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR)). The 3D content (object or scene) can then be viewed with six degrees of freedom and in stereovision. This provides a complete solution to capture a generic object regardless of shape and material in a portable 3D format without manual post-editing.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to develop a low cost and reliable torque sensor for use with automotive and related
    applications. As the proposed torque sensing method is based on the speed, it
    can be used with most of the engine/transmission systems.  However, this technique
    requires modifications to make it suitable for use with electric engines.  This
    will enhance its applicability over a larger range of vehicle applications.  Automotive
    manufacturers also need the comparison of input torque at the engine and the torque
    delivered after the differential to the wheels.  This knowledge further helps
    in reducing possible losses in torque, and improving the efficiencies. This torque
    sensing method can meet automobile industry requirements of improved efficiency,
    low cost, while also providing accurate engine torque measurements. The total
    available market could include all automotive engines and transmissions in the
    medium and heavy duty vehicles, off-high way vehicles and others in the transportation
    sector. The long-term goal of this project is to expand the use of this method
    in other sectors, where instantaneous torque measurement can help to improve the
    process efficiency.\n \nThis I-Corps Project will help to investigate the commercialization
    potential of low cost torque sensors in different engine/transmission driven applications.
    \ Relying on a virtual torque sensing concept, the proposed method requires minimal
    additional hardware, which makes it an economically attractive concept for automotive
    manufacturers.  Currently, automotive engine and transmission manufacturers use
    estimates for torque values.   The company found that the current engine ECU torque
    estimation has an accuracy of 5-30%.  Commercially available torque sensors cost
    $500 to $10000, making them non-viable for commercial transportation vehicles.
    Overall, the goal of the project is to seamlessly integrate the sensor along with
    the existing mechanical and electronic systems. This sensing method is being tested
    in a commercially available test facility.  An improvement in the accuracy of
    torque sensing can result in improved fuel efficiency, better driving comfort
    and reduced wear of gears.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to ablate brain tumors and other cranial soft tissues with less infection, better outcomes, and reduced cost compared to current alternatives. Currently, there are around 700,000 individuals diagnosed with brain tumor in the US, with another 80,000 expected to be diagnosed this year (National Brain Tumor Society, 2017). Nearly two thirds, or 54,000, of these patients will undergo surgery as a first course of treatment at one of 5,000 neurosurgical centers in the US. The majority of patients are currently treated with invasive cranial flap resection procedures. Furthermore, the proposed technology may offer a therapeutic option for the 13,000 patients with high-risk primary malignant tumors that may be considered inoperable with current surgical approaches. The thermal ablation medical device market represents a $2.2B opportunity in the US, with ultrasound thermal ablation technology valued at $334M with an annual market growth rate of 13.5% (BCC Research, 2017). This innovation would offer a unique tool for neurosurgeons apart from cranial surgical navigation tools with a $459M US market, which are currently considered the standard of care for cranial surgery.

    This I-Corps project will explore a minimally invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) device to ablate brain tumors and other cranial soft tissues, which features a hybrid transducer tip to apply therapeutic ultrasound to the targeted anatomy while simultaneously using ultrasound imaging to visualize the surgery site. Our simulation modeling determined the appropriate parameters for an initial prototype to precisely focus ultrasound and create a lesion using a flexible transducer phased array in a heterogeneous medium volume simulating cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue (Zhang et al., 2017, AAPM Annual Meeting). These data showed that our system could provide the same efficacy of treatment with two orders of magnitude less power than non-invasive, transcranial HIFU devices. The project team then built a prototype based on the simulation results, and showed proof-of-concept functionality using a bovine serum albumin protein phantom. One of the primary challenges of this project will be to maintain the acoustic performance of the probe as the project moves toward miniaturization of the technology to fit the probe within the brain ventricles. The team will pursue further customer discovery to gain a deeper understanding of the clinical workflow, revenue streams, reimbursement, and regulatory aspects, with the goal to build an evidence-based business plan.

    and diesel fuel.  Additionally, stationary fuel cells can provide a zero emission
    electricity source.  Developing a viable system to convert organic waste into
    renewable hydrogen in a modular, decentralized fashion can be a paradigm changer
    for hydrogen supply and the fuel cell market while solving additional societal
    issues surrounding food waste and fossil fuel emissions. \n\nThis I-Corps project
    proposes to develop a modular microbial electrolysis stack system capable of continuous
    high-rate hydrogen production from food waste. The innovation is based on electron
    or electricity producing bacteria, which generate current from organic waste and
    a device that Electro-Active has developed to enable high-rate hydrogen production
    from that current. It incorporates optimized reactor design and operation to sustain
    productivities typically seen only with pure substrates. To demonstrate proof-of-concept
    for this technology, target productivities and price point must be demonstrated
    in a larger reactor unit over a longer period of time. Sustained performance requires
    high-rate biocatalytic conversion of feedstock, and high-rate proton transport
    to the cathode. To overcome these challenges, a patented microbial enrichment
    process has been created to develop a robust microbial community capable of converting
    complex waste into electrons at high rates and efficiency. Additionally, preliminary
    data with robust biocatalyst, novel reactor design and operation provides evidence
    that the integrated approach can overcome these limitations.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    to enable more effective commercialization of a sustainable lawn alternative in
    the form of wildflower sod. Grass lawns are ubiquitous in the continental US covering
    an estimated 40 million acres of land, an area more than three times that of any
    other crop, including corn, soy and wheat. While grass lawns are beloved by American
    landowners, they are expensive, requiring more water, pesticide and fertilizer
    inputs than any other crop. These inputs degrade waterways and create biological
    deserts. In response, there is a growing call for sustainable lawn alternatives
    with an emphasis on native wildflower meadows. Despite the demand for meadowscapes,
    grass only turf continues to dominate the US landscape, in part, because the United
    States (US) does not have dependable, effective tools for meadow establishment.
    Introduction of wildflower sod/turf products to the US market will contribute
    to desired societal outcomes; such as meeting objectives mandated by state and
    federal water quality policies and initiatives, increasing biodiversity and helping
    ensure the health of pollinating insect communities, which provide food security
    through the pollination of wild and cultivated crops. \n\nThis I-Corps project
    will advance the teams knowledge of potential barriers to widespread adoption
    of wildflower meadows. While the ecological benefits of wildflower meadows are
    fairly well understood, few studies have investigated meadow implementation from
    the perspective of land managers, landscape professionals and communities. Understanding
    the market obstacles of replacing high input lawns with sustainable flowering
    meadows is the first step in finding viable solutions. The technology being pursued
    is a biodiverse meadow sod comprised of native grasses and wildflowers. Conceptually,
    it is similar to traditional sod in that the turf is moveable and easy to install.
    The US team has partnered with a UK company which developed the production system
    on which the new technology is based, and has been the leading supplier of wildflower
    turf in Great Britain since 2003. The new IP will include adapting the UK growing
    system to 1) work with US plant species and climates, and 2) development of native
    seed mixes that grow well in the production system and that will provide the desired
    aesthetics for an urban setting\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is primarily a solution to recent concerns of the effects of nanoparticles on overall health. Based on scientific claims that nanoparticles are detrimental to an individuals health, regulatory agencies, companies, and the general public have become more vigilant in finding non-nano alternatives to materials and products that they have been using. In addition to providing a non-nano alternative to existing metal oxides used in many personal care products, this project also allows for more environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and end products. Cost-effective synthetic methods will allow for these alternatives to be feasible replacements to formulators, toxicologists, and other people involved in the manufacturing decision-making process.

    This I-Corps project aims to focus on finding the best product market fit for the novel synthetic methodology of Zinc Oxide. This synthesis relies on milder temperatures with only water-based precursors that are utilized to yield surfactant-free, morphologically identical, and non-nano zinc oxide particles. The same methodology can be use to yield metal-doped zinc oxide constructs with enhanced properties depending on the metal used. The eclectic nature and environmentally friendly qualities of the reactants make this one-pot synthesis a perfect candidate for an ecologically conscious alternative to the state-of-the-art zinc oxide synthesis.

    to provide a biological measure of Parkinsons disease (PD) which is extremely
    valuable in determining treatment strategies for PD patients and in drug development
    against PD. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United
    States with treatment costs that exceeded $14.4 billion in 2010 and projected
    to double by 2040. Effective treatment of PD requires reliable early diagnosis
    of PD, however no objective test for definitive diagnosis of PD currently exists.
    Current diagnosis is based on outward symptoms like tremors, slow movement, rigid
    muscle, brain imaging and usually requires multiple visits with neurology specialists
    to avoid misdiagnosis. In fact, a 2013 study determined that the direct cost of
    diagnosis for a new PD patient on average amounts to $7,322 and with 60,000 new
    diagnosis of PD made every year in US, the market of PD diagnosis is estimated

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase student and eventually, employee engagement, by better aligning skills and innate interests with degree programs, particularly novel STEM programs. In response to increasing demand for new types of jobs, degree programs such as Computational Genomics and Music Technology have combined fields that have historically been distinct.  This project enables students to discover both traditional and emerging majors relevant to them. By providing actionable insights and better alignment of interests early on, this decreases the friction of changing majors (~80% currently) during college and begins to mitigate widespread lack of engagement (~70%) in the workplace.  Compared with traditional methods that match GPAs, test scores, unstructured essays, and resumes, with schools, majors, and job openings, this project could revolutionize the way students identify, train and prepare for their future careers.

    This I-Corps project is based on a novel patent-pending technology of a unified multi-dimensional data representation method called Skills Genome. Skills Genome can be exploited by several machine learning models, allowing for capturing and modeling complex student data inputs such as critical thinking, communication, interests, leadership, etc. with temporal graphs.  By making the structure of the graph accessible to several machine learning models, the method improves accuracy, relevance and facilitates scale.  Specifically, this tracks the student?s development timeline, so they can best determine the timing and sequencing of skills needed for their chosen careers.  Further, by matching profiles at scale, new insights into potential careers can be surfaced, along with the next steps needed to achieve them.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be quicker and more reliable discovery of human burial sites.  The proposed product will help law enforcement officers at municipal, county, state and federal levels discover clandestine human burials thereby aiding in the solution of crimes and enhancing public safety.  Likewise, applications in the military arena would enable discovery of the remains of soldiers missing in action (MIAs), mass graves created during genocide, and other casualties of conflict.  Because the technology of the product has a very general capability, a product based on the same hardware and software may be customized for a variety of commercial applications.  These include: (1) environmental mapping and remediation efforts; (2) cultural resource or heritage management, e.g., by documenting Native American burial grounds; (3) characterization of soil chemistry for agribusiness applications; (4) mapping of sites in archaeology.  All of these applications would create greater demand with resulting commercial and employment opportunities.  Finally, since successful applications will receive media attention, they will provide the opportunity to educate the public about the nature of the science, the value of scientific research to the public good, and technology involved in the product.

    This I-Corps project involves a novel adaptation of existing technologies (spectroscopy, push-probe soil tests) to a new application within forensic science.  The basic concepts of the technologies are well-established.  The product, a robotic mobile device, pushes a probe into the ground at the test locations.  The probe has a window that allows the soil to be illuminated with visible and near infrared light.  Reflected light is collected by fiber optics which carry the light to the surface to be analyzed.  The fraction of each color of light that is absorbed by the soil carries the signature of the chemical content of the soil at each underground location.  These data are then interpreted in terms of the decay products (mainly fatty acids) that indicate the presence of human cadavers.  PI?s earlier research was successful in identifying burials in both controlled mock crime scenes and in real forensic contexts involving disturbed human graves.  The proposed product will provide real-time, reliable interpretation of the data to indicate the presence of a 'hit', an essential part of the value proposition of the product for law enforcement applications.  This marks a very significant improvement over current lab-based analyses.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to address a current void in medical and clinical practices across a broad scope of disciplines (e.g., dentofacial orthopedist, speech language pathologist, sleep medicine specialist, respiratory therapist, orofacial myofunctional therapist) specializing in Orofacial Myofunctional Disorders (OMD) (i.e., sleep apnea, dysphagia, malocclusions, tongue thrusts, articulation). Millions of people worldwide are impacted by some intricate and individualized form of OMD each year. Currently, there is a limited number of oral function diagnostic devices available. Providing a device, PARROT, that will capture real-time natural lingual behavior outside a controlled clinical setting may further one?s understanding of the obscure happenings within the oral cavity. Such information may further advance OMD diagnostic and rehabilitation practices as well as promote the engagement of new research across several medical and clinical fields. Recognizing the growing prevalence of OMD across multiple health related disciplines and the projected growth of a multibillion-dollar medical device manufacturing industry, PARROT may address such a need.

    This I-Corps project is purposed toward enhancing one's quality of life by establishing a robust method to view lingual behaviors potentially associated with OMD. The tongue's placement within the oral cavity obstructs and limits accessibility to observe and objectively record natural lingual behaviors (i.e., spatial positioning, placement, movement and performance). Such limitations may dilute biofeedback purposed toward identifying atypical patterns or mechanics potentially causing or promoting an OMD; thereby, impeding the appropriate application to effectively treat the OMD. PARROT is a wireless orofacial myofunctional imaging and pressure mapping appliance that introduces the potential for a systematic approach to objectively evaluate natural lingual behavior (e.g., region specific lingual movement, positional habits, and performance) while allowing an individual to continue routine daily activities and behaviors. To date, a particular proximity sensor has been identified for measuring tongue-palate distance along with contact and motion displacement across the stretch of the tongue in the oral cavity, while a specific pressure mapping matrix will measure intensity of pressure applied by the tongue across the palate and upper dentition. PARROT is currently in an Alpha Prototype state with configuration and optimization of biomaterials continuing prior to Beta Prototype validation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project lies in the broad field of synthesis and application of protective coatings. One specific commercial application is synthesis of anti-corrosive coatings on variety of substrate materials. Owing to the unique intrinsic properties of graphene, the system enables lower coating cost and faster synthesis times. These protective coatings are utilized in multiple industries including aerospace, automotive, and oil and gas. This project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology and will inform further technical developments and possible commercialization paths and will create new research and commercialization thrusts in the overall field of plasma nanoscience.

    This I-Corps project is focused on advancing the innovative approach of Radio Frequency plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) technique for synthesis the large quantities of graphene coatings on various substrate materials. Recent research advances indicate that graphene can be effectively generated in the plasma discharge environment. Plasma CVD synthesis has been shown to be effective in the production of monolayer and several-layer sheets of crystalline films of graphene characterized by high quality and low structural defects. In addition, utilization of plasma flux at synthesis enhances mobility and reactivity of the species participating in the synthesis process on the substrate's surface in comparison with that when atomic flux is used.  This enables synthesis at lower temperatures and widens range of substrate materials that can be used in the synthesis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improving public health systems by predicting, monitoring, and preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases. The broader applications of the proposed software system for analysis of sequencing data will also include tracing cancer development and analyzing its potential to grow, mutate, and resist treatment. The proposed software system will be integrated into laboratories' pipelines for clustering and assembling sequencing reads into complete genomic sequences. The proposed statistical algorithms will analyze the sequencing data more accurately which improves sequencing quality without an increase in sequencing depth thus further reducing sequencing cost.  The proposed software system will attract epidemiological and medical laboratories by more accurate analysis and cost reduction of high-throughput sequencing.

    This I-Corps project deals with growing demand for powerful computational tools for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. Existing software tools can successfully extract different sequences form the same sample but, in many applications, (such as an investigation of outbreaks of infectious disease, cancer research, and genome-wide association studies) it is necessary to distinguish multiple distinct yet closely related genomic sequences. The main obstacle for such studies is a high sequencing error rate and short length of reads produced by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The proposed software system can overcome these obstacles by using statistical algorithms capable of sorting out the sequencing errors delivering complete genomic sequences and accurately identifying point mutations distinguishing closely related sequences.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps VSTEP Digital Health project is to increase clinician efficiency and engagement with therapy for persons with neurological conditions such as post-stroke and with Parkinson Disease.   Using off-the shelf hardware and custom software decreases cost both for equipment purchase and providing care. It also facilitates that clinics of all sizes can adopt innovative technology in treatment of patients.  Customization of therapy may increase clinician productivity, enhance outcomes and decrease treatment time. Insights on patient and clinician performance can help clinics and insurance providers lower costs and provide better care. Societal impact may be achieved by providing an engaging therapy that increases socialization and decrease loneliness and most importantly increases activity and participation in society. The project will facilitate a decision about whether to pursue further development and commercialization of the technology.

    This I-Corps project seeks to explore the commercial potential of The VSTEP Digital Health Platform which is an integrated solution for the comprehensive examination and treatment of balance, mobility, coordination and fitness deficits of persons with neurologic conditions. These deficits which occur frequently after neurologic diagnosis, persist when not treated and interfere with activity and participation in societal roles. The technology integrates motion and heart rate sensing with activity based engaging therapeutic games presented in a virtual environment. It also has an examination suite which uses standardized assessments that guide the therapeutic activities. Customization of the therapy ensures that the patient's goals are achieved and the clinicians? insights and reasoning for care are incorporated with the technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the SoleMate Solutions' smart insole will optimize patient rehabilitation for lower extremity conditions. Currently, issues with patient compliance lead to unintended costs to the healthcare industry. Lower extremity conditions are especially prone to issues because of the lack of clarity on how to recover at home. This process is subject to confusion which can cause patients to either apply too much or too little weight during rehabilitation, leading to many complications. These can include malalignment of bone which requires additional treatment or even surgery. 15 million people experience lower extremity injuries each year and the rate of complications lead to approximately $12 billion in unintended costs. The SoleMate insole aims to resolve this issue by providing patients with real-time feedback to correct form by measuring weight applied while walking. This information is not only helpful for patients, but physicians are also informed on how compliant patients were during recovery. There are no other products that can track rehabilitation based on weightbearing. Furthermore, the applications for this technology extend past medicine. An insole that can accurately track how someone walks can be applied to sports and orthopedic research.

    This I-Corps project is aimed for manufacturing a device that can accurately measure weightbearing while walking during an episode of care. Sensors placed in the insole are coupled with a patient-specific algorithm that generates a summary that patients can check on their smart phone. This information will also be integrated into a patient?s summary on recovery at the doctor?s office. Real-time feedback on how much weight a patient applies throughout the day can correct for form. From a clinician?s perspective, this information can be useful on tailoring future treatment to the individual. There are other research devices that can accurately measure how someone walks, but these devices are typically expensive and wired to a computer. Creating a wireless device allows for continual feedback and a more accurate picture of someone?s activity throughout the day. Lower extremity rehabilitation would be less confusing with a smart insole that can track form and activity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project addresses 1) improving the overall cochlear implant (CI) programming process, 2) enabling the assessment of the CI electrode array placement which has been shown to affect hearing outcomes, 3) reducing the subjectivity in CI programming by providing patient-specific objectives and quantitative information, and 4) creating a patient focused procedure by enabling CI users to have a better understanding of factors that affect their outcomes. According to the latest reports from several CI companies, around 37 million could benefit from a CI; the number of candidates among newborns each year alone is estimated around 150,000. This technology will not only individualize and enhance hearing outcomes but it will also increase market penetration, by making the benefits more apparent and programming less of a burden, thereby allowing more people to take advantage of the CI technology. Additionally, overall improved hearing outcomes will reduce isolation faced by older adults with poor hearing outcomes.

    This I-Corps project utilizes cutting-edge image processing algorithms that localize crucial inner ear structures as well as cochlear implant (CI) electrodes. The resulting information enables estimation of auditory nerve stimulation patterns which are then used to help guide CI programming where the goal is to determine a set of satisfactory settings that will lead to better hearing outcomes. Currently, the programming process is more of a subjective exercise than a patient-specific procedure that is based on quantitative and objective measurements. Clinical studies conducted with over 200 participating CI recipients have showed that significant improvements in speech discrimination as well as recognition in both noisy and quiet environments were achieved when CIs were programmed using this technology. In addition, over 70% of those participants decided to keep their new mapping. This project will help 1) better understand the features and characteristics of the current cochlear implant market including eligibility, surgery and programming, 2) consider the challenges in overcoming the status quo and changing the current audiological process, and 3) determine a commercially viable business model that will improve both the programming process and the hearing outcomes for CI users.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to teach math in after-school or summer enrichment  settings located in under-resourced communities. This project will result in cohorts of trained college student math mentors engaging younger students in the full set of digital learning and mentoring services aimed at mathematics.  This program can be integrated into the activities of existing academic enrichment program, such as those associated with the YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs and other private entities. Because the trained mentors are college students employed by the company and often already volunteering for the afterschool programs, there is incentive for such private providers to partner with the PI's team and utilize their services. Increasing standardized test scores by reinforcing classroom learning in out-of-school settings is a value proposition for school districts and schools. Parents also see the importance of their children receiving a full high school diploma, which is predicated on standardized test scores.

    This I-Corps project  utilizes a game-based learning platform which uses the format of popular action games to implement math lessons.  The user interface is a three-dimensional first-person environment which can be displayed on a personal computer, mobile device or adapted to a virtual reality system.  Once in play, the scenarios given to the student teach the underlying principles behind math techniques. Gaming scenarios can compile to span full curriculums aligned with standardized tests. The digital experience is then reinforced in physical space by trained math mentors in after-school settings, Phygital Math Play rests on the premise that Physical and Digital gaming experiences can be used as motivational tools to learn mathematics in grades K-12. Just as the relational bonds between gamers is a crucial component of digital games, the mentor-mentee relationship will be developed and cultivated for physical play. An important element for this venture is building a mentoring infrastructure between institutions of higher learning and their surrounding school districts. The project team asserts that there should be no distressed school district within 20 miles of a minority-serving institution. To that end, undergraduate mentors will be trained to help reinforce the math concepts linking physical play and digital application experience to pencil-paper computation.

    to identify stakeholders and customers and to develop the most appropriate path
    forward to translate the company's technology to the clinic and bring it to the
    patients. Currently young girls suffering from premature ovarian insufficiency
    (POI) as a result of anticancer treatments have limited and inadequate options
    to undergo puberty and start their transition into adult life. The existing hormone
    replacement therapy (HRT) applied to induce puberty in girls with POI leads to
    long-term morbidities, such as decreased bone density, predisposition to obesity
    and diabetes. The company's technology allows the restoration of ovarian endocrine
    function in prepubescent girls and has the potential to become a central mainstream
    treatment for POI, which would result in significant improvement of the short
    and long-term health and eliminate long-term morbidities associated with premature
    ovarian failure. The commercial benefit of the proposed treatment would result
    from significant lower health costs associated with obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project will further the company's understanding of the current
    state of the field and the value of the proposed technology, and help identify
    the next steps for preclinical and clinical studies. The company developed an
    immunoisolating capsule that supports the survival and function of ovarian allograft
    eliminating the need for immune suppression. The company's central hypothesis
    is that ovarian tissue secretes the gonadal hormones, estradiol, progesterone,
    androstenedione, activins and inhibins, in response to systemic hormone stimulation
    in a pulsatile and dynamic rate required for physiological progression through
    puberty, growth and associated metabolic changes. Experimental data from in vivo
    mouse and primate studies have demonstrated promising results of restoration of
    hormone function integrated in the endocrine system and neuroendocrine axis, with
    no evidence of immune rejection or local inflammatory adverse response. The next
    critical steps in the company's project is to perform customer discovery and identify
    partners for first-in-human trials.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of semiconductor devices for electronic, photonic, and energy applications. For example, the proposed innovation will bring 40% total cost reduction in light-emitting diodes (LED) chip/die manufacturing, which will provide a faster route for the energy-efficient LEDs to become a dominant lighting source. The innovation will also offer a new device platform for electric power conversion and switching in electric vehicles and smart-grid systems, which means significant benefits in energy saving and greenhouse-gas emission reduction. Hence, the proposed innovation will facilitate the rapid development of next-generation green device technology that can readily be applied to the real-world systems. Furthermore, the flexible material platforms will enable not only mechanically flexible devices for the applications of portable, wearable, and implantable systems, but also new devices with additional functionality for more versatile applications beyond just flexible devices. The new transformative technologies stemming from this project will help U.S. semiconductor manufacturers cope with global challenges and win in the competitive international markets. Therefore, the new platform will contribute to consolidating the U.S. position as a technology and market leader by strategically strengthening the innovation ecosystem of the semiconductor technology.

    This I-Corps project proposes a promising replacement for single-crystalline wafer substrates of semiconductor devices by offering a new mechanically-flexible low-cost substrate. The objective of the project is to deliver commercially available low-cost, high-crystalline-quality, and flexible tape substrates to be employed as a new platform of photonic and electronic semiconductor devices. To accomplish the objective, the team will develop a new substrate consisting of flexible metal tape and a single-crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor thin film by an invented direct deposition technique. This method also enables the roll-to-roll and large-scale continuous production of high-quality semiconductor materials. The developed GaN/metal tape will to serve as the substrate for the fabrication of LEDs, as an initial target of the innovative technology, and other semiconductor devices. The result will be flexible inorganic LEDs with high efficiency and application versatility at a fraction of the cost of current solid-state lighting sources. The new product, while it is a potentially disruptive technology, has not been deployed in the device market with various products and applications. Therefore, understanding of business development will be critical. The team will perform customer survey and business model development via investigation of value proposition and customer discovery.

    of the light field transmission channel.  This messaging paradigm also improves
    on prior QR-codes because the code does not distract from the visible image and

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in the area of human and animal health care. The proposed device will continue to improve and modernize the US heath care system allowing it to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The technology aims to streamline the manufacturing process of blood products (e.g. Cryoprecipitate AHF) by reducing production time, increasing product throughput and improving product consistency while enabling customized medicine when using blood products (e.g. controlling the specific levels of fibrinogen and anticoagulants for the specific need of the patient). Besides personalized medicine, the technology also enables ways for improved product consistency. The commercial impact relies on developing a technology that addresses the current issues with the current technology. The proposed device focuses on the most frequent complaint of current technologies by staff, technicians and doctors, which is the time consumption nature of the process. The costumers and/or users of this technology include general hospitals, blood banks, medical centers, and animal hospitals. Specifically, the most likely typical customer to buy the medical device would be the administrators of hospitals and blood banks. The most likely end users of the medical device are lab technicians.

    This I-Corps project aims to streamline the current manufacturing process of cryoprecipitate [Antihemophilic Factor (AHF)] by reducing production time, increasing product throughput, and improving product consistencies. Cryoprecipitate is a blood-derived product that contains proteins called clotting factors. Among these factors is fibrinogen, one of the most important components that allows the blood to form a strong, sturdy clot in a process called secondary homeostasis. It is most commonly used as part of a massive transfusion where large numbers of blood components are required to assist with clotting (i.e. to help control bleeding or reduce the risk of bleeding during a surgery). Commonly, the cryoprecipitate production process involves a tedious manual process requiring that a technician massage the product before the product is pooled into an administration bag for patient delivery.  At some medical institutions the current process for cryoprecipitate production is time consuming (e.g. kneading process), labor intensive (i.e. lab technicians are at risk of carpal tunnel syndrome/tendonitis or ganglionic cysts), and hospitals cannot meet volume demands (i.e. outsource needed). The proposed medical device aims to shorten the amount of time, decrease the manual labor needed, increase cryoprecipitate product throughput, and improve product consistencies.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be reducing the required weight and power consumption of robotics hardware. A particularly promising field is in the domain of human-machine interaction, including prostheses, haptic devices, exoskeletons, and other wearable technologies designed to assist users with disabilities or augment the performance of able-bodied users. Current devices are severely limited by the weight, power consumption, and power output of conventional actuators and transmissions. Using clutched springs to improve the performance of these devices could dramatically reduce their weight, leading to more comfortable and effective motion assistance. Products based on the company's electroadhesive clutch could also offer improved energy efficiency and versatility in industrial robot arms. Much of the energy consumed by large industrial arms stems from supporting the body weight and moving the arm?s inertia. Using electroadhesive clutches and springs to provide adjustable gravity cancelling and to harvest and return kinetic energy would significantly reduce energy costs. Additionally, electrically controllable transmissions could enable control mode switching for performing a wider range of tasks, potentially reducing the amount of time required to manufacture products.

    This I-Corps project will focus on the commercial potential of the company's novel electroadhesive clutch prototype that weighs 10 times less and consumes 1000 times less power than other clutch technologies. Conventional clutches operate using electro-magnetic solenoids or magneto-rheological fluid, both of which require heavy components and significant electrical power to operate. The company's electroadhesive clutch uses thin, lightweight materials and operates with a fundamentally different technique, allowing us to transmit up to 180 N of force with a device that weighs 15 grams, consumes 3.2 mW of power, and activates at 320 V DC. The activation/deactivation times of the company's electroadhesive clutch are 20 ms, which is comparable with the best conventional clutches. We have also performed a fatigue test demonstrating more than 3 million loading cycles. The company recently conducted an extensive experimental study of the effects of design parameters on these performance metrics, and now has a strong understanding of the appropriate design of clutches for a broad range of applications. The company's clutch has the potential to improve the performance of existing products that use clutches and enable new designs that would be infeasible when subjected to the limits of traditional clutches.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a next-generation, high-resolution ultrasonic imaging technique for medical and non-destructive testing applications. This technique will improve on existing imaging technologies by enabling highly detailed physical and spatial properties of the imaged material to be determined, beyond what is currently capable from ultrasound, X-Rays or MRI. This will enhance the capability of medical and non-destructive imaging technologies, for example, by allowing more accurate identification and diagnoses of tumor tissues in medical scans, or improving the identification of defects in manufactured parts. Combined with the benefits of ultrasound, in particular, safety, speed, portability, patient comfort, and cost, this technology has potential for broad impact. Commercially, the technology will enable medical practitioners to make diagnoses faster and with higher accuracy. This will allow earlier and more precise identification of tumors, reducing the number of false positives and follow-up procedures. This will ultimately increase diagnostic efficiency, reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. In a non-destructive testing application, this technology will enable imaging detail that was previously only available with more expensive and time-consuming techniques such as X-Rays.

    This I-Corps project combines techniques from the fields of ultrasonic imaging and the geosciences to significantly improve existing mm- to cm-scale imaging technologies. The technology adapts an advanced geophysical imaging method known as full waveform inversion (FWI) for medical and non-destructive testing purposes. Full waveform inversion is conventionally applied for imaging the earth?s structure and to discover oil and gas reservoirs. Instead of applying the technique at seismic scales (m to km), the company applies it at the ultrasonic scale (mm to cm) to generate high-resolution 3-dimensional images with embedded physical properties. Research is focused on both software and hardware development. Software algorithms are being developed which construct images from ultrasonic measurements within seconds to minutes. This is enabled through the use of cutting-edge, highly efficient algorithms and high-performance computing infrastructure. Research and development of prototype hardware is also being undertaken, necessary for generating high-quality ultrasonic data for input into the imaging algorithms. To-date, rapid, high-resolution 2- and 3-dimensional image construction using full waveform inversion techniques has been demonstrated on a range of ?synthetic? ultrasonic-scale objects. This demonstrates that images can be quickly generated, containing a full range of material properties including material density, stiffness and attenuation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be replacement of toxic, lead-based radiation shielding materials with non-toxic bismuth composites that are lighter weight and have equivalent or better radiation shielding protection. These bismuth composites can be flexibly fashioned into a variety of shapes, including aprons, gloves, hats and drapes, to provide custom protection for medical and other radiation-exposed workers.  Because of the reduced weight burden and increased flexibility of the bismuth composites relative to lead, we expect that our product will significantly reduce physical strain on personnel who wear these garments, while also being biologically and environmentally safer.

    This I-Corps project will evaluate the commercial potential of radiation shielding bismuth composite materials, which are produced using our patented technology, in several different market spaces, including medical, dental, veterinary, electronics, and military sectors.  Based on initial prototypes and measurements of X-ray attenuation, we calculate that we will be able to produce a flexible radiation protective barrier that is 50% lighter than traditional lead-based barriers, with the same or better shielding protection.  The patented method to produce the X-ray opaque material is highly scalable, and the proposed work will determine effective commercialization strategies for this technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to meet the increasing demand of energy consumption and maintain a healthy oil and gas output in the US. Machine vision and automatic data picking are viable approaches to keep up with the data multiplication of seismic surveys. The proposed product is the first one that is aiming at minimizing labor burden in seismic data processing by using a deep neural network with a novel and efficient transfer learning strategy. If successful, the novel deep transfer learning approach will build the foundation for adopting advanced deep neural network technologies by many other industrial applications. In addition to the Oil and Gas industry, the product can also be used in other important areas such as geothermal energy exploration.

    This I-Corps project is to explore the market potential for a product to automatically identify unique patterns embedded in the seismic data. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the theme of a novel deep transfer learning approach, which will ease the training burden of the deep neural network and solve the training data shortage problem by utilizing discriminative unsupervised feature learning to learn high-level representations that are more invariant to variations between the synthetic and real data. The innovativeness of our proposal is that it is aimed to build a reliable system to perform various pattern recognition tasks required by the seismic data processing and be adaptive to different datasets acquired through seismic surveys. This product has the potential to save up to 20% to 50% of the total seismic processing time.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project to enable a non-invasive, simple and portable monitoring blood glucose levels from human breath. This project will provide the commercialization training to graduate students and enhance students learning on commercialization skills. As a potential societal impact, this innovation will enhance the quality of life, by using noninvasive breath sensors for the recognition of human blood glucose level for diabetics. New discoveries will be disseminated through presentations, workshops, partnerships, and potential technology transfer to a start-up company. Industrial collaborators from various companies will help translate this innovation into engineering practice. More than 100 people will be outreached about the innovations in the noninvasive diabetes sensors during the interview process.

    This I-Corps project is to conduct market analysis and customer interviews for commercializing a noninvasive breath biosensor for detecting acetone in exhaled breath for the recognition of human blood glucose level. The molecular imprinted layer improved the selectivity of the sensors by allowing the specific molecule to be exposed into the sensor. The acetone-imprinted sensor shows a wide range of linear relationship with the growth of the acetone concentrations in the range of 0-10 ppm at a sensitivity about 15 &#8486;/ppm. This sensor has the following advantages over the existing diabetes sensors in the market. This sensor has a linear gas response to acetone from <0.9 ppm to 10 ppm, which leads to accurate detection of acetone concentration in breath of patients with diabetes (usually in the range of 1.7 ppm to 3.7 ppm). This sensor demonstrates high stability, improved selectivity, and high sensitivity for acetone from different gas molecules such as moisture, ethanol, etc. This sensor has a small size that can fit in a pocket. Patients with diabetes can conveniently and discretely carry the sensor for real-time detection of acetone in exhaled breath to recognize human blood glucose level and help determine a patient?s insulin needs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable new and improved lateral flow assays (LFAs) through the development of hollow metal nanoparticles as highly sensitive color labels. LFAs are commonly used in environmental monitoring, food safety testing, and point-of-care clinical diagnostics (the most common example is the home pregnancy test). The company?s core technology will improve the performance of the active component in LFA devices, translating to faster and more accurate diagnoses, more timely treatment regimens, and decreased health care costs for patients and providers worldwide. These advantages should prove especially important in resource-constrained settings where access to established laboratories equipped with expensive instrumentation is cost- or time-prohibitive. Thus, the improvement and expansion of rapid, affordable, LFA point-of-care diagnostic platforms represent a critical need and will have broad impacts in public health on a global scale. Moreover, with the growing adoption of nanotechnology throughout industry, there is rapidly increasing demand for intentionally designed nanostructures in a wide range of applications ranging from chemical catalysis to optoelectronics. Securing a foothold in the LFA industry will establish the infrastructure necessary to diversify the company?s product distribution into other industries that could also benefit from the advantages of hollow metal nanoparticles.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for hollow metal nanoparticles. Hollow nanoparticles have substantial advantages over their solid counterparts, including lower mass per particle for reduced material costs, higher surface-area-to-volume ratio for increased loading, and enhanced plasmonic performance. The company?s primary technology is the highly uniform synthesis of hollow metal nanoparticles with predetermined dimensions, surface morphology, optical response, and metal composition. Currently, most conventional LFAs use 30-40 nm solid gold particles, which suffer from low capture rate and low visual contrast. In order to improve the sensitivity of these devices, we have developed more advanced nanostructures which will be captured more effectively and provide greater contrast. Implementing robust customer discovery will enable us to determine the extent of product customization that would be most useful to this target industry. Successfully making this determination and subsequently commercializing the company?s technology would enable LFAs with greater sensitivity, opening the door for platform expansion to previously undetectable diseases and toxins. Moreover, through the company?s immersion into customer discovery and business model canvas principles, we will become experts in the Lean LaunchPad methodology and can then apply this methodology to future target customer segments.

    a full-blown episode of diabetes. \n\n86 million Americans are pre-diabetic with
    risk for developing type 2 diabetes and a cost of $2.3T. Evidence-based research
    has resulted in a protocol called diabetes prevention program (DPP), taught by
    diabetes coaches and covered by insurance. But usage/adherence to DPP is low.
    9 out of 10 patients are unaware. Programs are underutilized, patients drop off
    and coaches are not paid by insurance due to non-compliance.\n\nThe company?s
    technology solution will use data and behavioral science to improve usage and
    adherence for DPP. This solution empowers doctors, diabetes coaches and patients
    to collectively improve long term self-care. By identifying risk of diabetes and
    connecting at-risk patients to programs, the company improves usage. By helping
    patients adhere to programs, the company helps programs comply and get paid. The
    company will collect software as a service (SaaS) fee from programs by helping
    them with revenue generation. The company will prove its value proposition in
    the diabetes prevention market with well-defined goals set by CDC/Medicare and
    use this evidence to move to other markets beyond diabetes. \n\nThis I-Corps project
    is a connected digital health platform with integrated delivery to improve patient
    adherence to health goals using insights from data science and behavioral science.
    It comprises of a web dashboard for health providers and a synced mobile app for
    patients. By aggregating and learning from decades of research in behavioral science,
    machine learning and medical adherence and combining it with connected technologies
    and computational power that have recently become available, the company is developing
    a better way to help patients adhere to their long term health goals. With smartphone
    usage at 77% (Pew Research, 2018), it is now easier to collect data automatically
    and continuously, intervene, support and track patients virtually. \n\nThe company
    is leveraging its team?s 75+ years of combined experience in healthcare, technology,
    behavioral psychology and entrepreneurship to tackle this challenge. The company
    will streamline data collection and management through wearables and connected
    technologies. The company will use this patient generated data to develop new
    predictive algorithms and visualize data to offer insights to patients and healthcare
    providers. Additionally, the company will implement behavioral science methodologies
    and tools such as gamification and nudging to reinforce healthy behaviors.\n\nThis

    cash while escaping conflict, retain access to savings typically lost during flight,
    and create an economic identity to establish themselves in a new country. The
    results of cross-border digital financial services include: (1) refugees will
    experience increased access to funds, which positively impacts long-term health
    and education; (2) refugees will be less dependent upon host states and foreign
    aid; (3) cross-border trade will increase, thus bolstering regional security.
    The commercial potential of this project is large, as refugees have been proven
    a viable market for commercial banking but have historically been excluded from
    the formal financial system. Of the 68 million people forcibly displaced around
    the world in 2018, 60% have access to mobile networks that provide the infrastructure
    for offering digital financial services even without a smartphone. New blockchain
    technology makes cross-border financial services lucrative with amounts previously
    too small to be profitable, thus opening the market to individuals at the bottom
    of the pyramid. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to address how to deliver virtual
    financial services in low technology environments using existing mobile networks
    and consumer behavior patterns. The technology utilizes mobile money, a USSD-based
    system common in emerging markets, as the cash-in and out point for customers.
    Transactions are stored on a transparent (yet de-identified) digital ledger that
    securely tracks assets across borders and fiat currencies. Blockchain technology
    presents new ways of meeting the financial needs of vulnerable populations, while
    a low-tech front-end ensures adoption in environments in which distribution is
    challenging. Customers use a custom USSD/SMS interface to create an account, send
    money for safekeeping, check balance, and disburse funds across borders. Customer
    identity is managed using biometrics such as facial and vocal recognition and
    a PIN. This type of cross-border, digital savings product integrated with USSD
    and blockchain has never been offered. The platform reliably links identity and
    provides the unique combination of asset storage and transport across borders.
    The digitization of cross-border money movement could reduce theft and corruption
    by up to 80%. This project seeks to prove that virtual financial services offered
    through mobile network infrastructure can bring new access to populations historically
    excluded from the formal economy.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project results from its utility for customizing interactive media experiences for diverse users in systems including workplace learning software, streaming media, educational games, and recommendation applications. This is enabled by the project's novel approach to implementing more nuanced user representations in software (online accounts, user profiles, avatars, etc.). Currently, customized systems' responses for specific user representations are expensive to produce and not expressive enough: they often are hardcoded, labor intensive to implement, and fail to support the particular needs of diverse users. In most such systems users' membership in categories (e.g., demographic groups or experts vs. novices) is determined in a top-down fashion, with no possibility for systems to respond to user representations that only partially fit in categories, inhabit multiple categories, or change over time. These deficiencies prevent systems from achieving the nuance of social category membership in everyday life. Finally, a key potential application is building interactive media supporting prosocial skill and knowledge development.

    This I-Corps project will advance knowledge related to modeling user identities in commercial and socially impactful digital media systems. Key to the intellectual merit of the project, the core technology is a computational engine that models identities (using data from profiles, avatars, characters, and accounts) by mathematically computing users' degrees of membership across multiple categories over time. To computationally model category degrees of category membership, the engine computes a closeness value corresponding to the degree to which an actor deviates from a prototypical member of a category, who is defined via a set of features. The degree of membership fluctuates throughout an interactive narrative based on user behaviors. Modeling these scenarios draws upon specific concepts from sociolinguistics, cognitive science, and sociology of classification. They include: category gradience, category dynamics, multiple memberships, inter-category relationships, and prototypes. Along with numerous publications, relevant prior work has been conveyed through invited keynotes and talks at major universities, foundations, and academic venues internationally.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide on-chip optical sensors that enable faster and cheaper production of drugs and chemicals. Pharmaceutical R&D and production rely heavily on chemical analysis to provide insight into the processes at play, however analytical instruments do not follow the latest manufacturing trends towards single-use technologies and smaller batches, or even continuous production. Integrated (on-chip) photonics is an attractive sensing platform thanks to its small form factor, robustness, large multiplexing capability, and tight optical confinement that enhances light-matter interactions. This project will pioneer the large-scale use of integrated photonic sensors starting with chemical sensing, paving the way to other applications. By enabling a better understanding of the reactions at play in manufacturing processes, the proposed technology is poised to impact the pharmaceutical market and help improving public health.

    This I-Corps project aims to develop the first practical implementation of a microchip-scale optical spectrometer. Integrated photonic product remain scarce due to several barriers at the fabrication and packaging levels. This project will mitigate these issues to offer equivalent sensitivity and performance to large benchtop optical spectrometers in a dramatically smaller form factor. This will be realized by combining recent advances in integrated photonic component design, photonic chip architecture, and optical packaging. The proposed sensor will enable novel chemical sensing applications and help with the understanding of processes at play in areas such as cell-based manufacturing and continuous-flow chemical manufacturing.

In the low-power embedded systems that drive IoT applications, energy efficiency is the primary factor that determines critical system characteristics such as size, weight, cost, reliability, and lifetime. Likewise, security is critical for IoT systems, which are entrusted with nearly all our data ? personal, financial, health-critical, and otherwise. Because of their extreme energy constraints and ubiquitous scale of deployment, these systems have traditionally favored low cost and low power over security, exposing a huge attack surface for information security attacks. Several large-scale exploits have already been reported. By providing automated and low-overhead solutions for security and energy efficiency, our technology has the potential to make a disruptive impact on the IoT space, which is predicted to have a market size of $457 billion by 2020. Additionally, the solutions we provide have the potential to improve information security for the population at large and allow broader deployment of IoT systems that promise to improve quality of life and understanding of the world.

    This I-Corps project is built around technologies that enable aggressive optimization of microprocessors for energy savings, cost reduction, and security. The technologies are based on novel, automated system analysis approaches that identify unused parts of a design and leverage the information to improve system efficiency. The technologies have demonstrated reductions of over an order of magnitude in energy efficiency and area for ultra-low-power microprocessors through a host of application-aware optimization and design techniques. The technologies also allow software programmers to evaluate information flow security for their software on the processor(s) where it will be deployed, enabling software to be certified with security guarantees. Results from our research and initial customer discovery indicate potential to impact the semiconductor industry. Through our technology, design and operating costs for application-specific processors can be significantly reduced, accelerating production of such processors, allowing them to be more widely deployed, and providing traction for new markets such as DIY printed processors. Also, reducing energy for low-power processors that drive the internet of things (IoT) can significantly impact lifetime, reliability, size, and cost of these devices that continue to grow in dominance of the semiconductor market as the IoT revolution continues.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to accelerate the discovery and development of new antimicrobial agents, including
    pharmaceuticals, disinfectants, preventative coatings, and more. Biofilms have
    serious economic and safety impacts on healthcare, food, industrial, and defense
    markets. They are responsible for an estimated $4.4B in annual healthcare costs
    from hospital acquired infections, $7B in costs from food borne illness, and billions
    of dollars in costs in lost agricultural crop production. In the industrial and
    defense industries, microbial induced corrosion from biofilms is estimated to
    be responsible for billions in costs per year. Novel anti-biofilm technologies
    are needed to reduce the safety and economic burdens of biofilms. In vitro screening
    of anti-biofilm activity is widely used in the discovery and development of anti-biofilm
    agents. Relevant research and development spending on in vitro screening is approximately
    $150M per year for companies developing disinfectants, $270M per year for companies
    developing antimicrobial drugs, and $140M per year for companies developing agrochemicals.
    \n\nThis I-Corps project is focused on a novel technology for growing highly accurate
    biofilms in vitro with significantly higher throughput than the current state-of-the-art.
    This new biofilm reactor can be used to grow biofilms for in vitro screening of
    anti-biofilm activity. It can grow up to 96 biofilm samples at once, and uses
    a flow-through setup to continuously pump fresh nutrients over biofilm cultures
    and recreate the conditions many biofilms experience outside of the lab. The biofilm
    reactor contains 12 channels, each channel containing 8 wells that accept a growth
    substrate (in the form of a 5mm diameter coupon disc) to culture the biofilm on.
    A variety of relevant growth substrate materials can be used to best replicate
    relevant conditions. A version of this new biofilm reactor has been made out of
    high-quality, autoclavable polypropylene and tested using Psuedomonas aeruginosa
    bacteria, a model biofilm forming organism. The biofilm reactor was able to reproducibly
    grow robust biofilms that were consistent from sample-to-sample.\n\nThis award

    Flooding is the leading cause of natural disaster fatalities and property damage across the United States. Mitigating water risks poses a serious challenge to water managers, companies, and home owners. This includes risk related to disaster response, stormwater infrastructure construction, and the management of water quality. Successful execution of this I-Corps project will result in new tools to address the challenges faced by the United States in the face of water disasters. This project will result in 'smart' water tools that address the management of water risk by investigating new methods based on data, analytics and sensing. This will reduce the risk associated with making decision in regard to flood forecasting, planning, and infrastructure construction. The project will also result in new jobs and workforce training as part of an emerging 'smart' water sector.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the economic value of water information. The project will engage with decision makers, including water managers, energy producers, and agricultural managers. A series of interviews will be conducted to improve the understanding of water challenges and risks faced by these parties. A focus will be placed on the role of information technologies, such as sensors, autonomous systems, and artificial intelligence tools. By quantifying water risk and improving the understanding of uncertainty, the project will provide new insights into the barriers that stand in the way of technology adoption in the water sector. The outcome of the project will transform the fundamental understanding of the role of 'smart' technologies in managing water resources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project empowers everyday users to participate in a new healthcare trend called 'self-quantification.'  Self-quantification allows individuals to obtain a deeper understanding of the state of their body, empowering them towards more proactive and precise approaches to optimize their health.  Our innovation provides an approach for low-cost, consumer scale self-quantification. Our technology simultaneously provides the health platform providers a secure, compliant transmission service for self-quantified data.  We have identified four primary customer segments which include 1) professional diagnostic developers, 2) digital and mobile 'self-quantification' health providers which include smartphone health/fitness mobile applications, 3) academic/corporate clinical investigators and 4) epidemiologists.  These customer segments act as distribution channels to the end users who will use the product.  Commercially, our product will penetrate a $46 billion 2020 mobile health market.  Broadly, with widespread use and the expansion of this technology to include the patient de-identified monitoring of a variety of prophylactic, disease and homeostatic biomarkers, current healthcare surveillance programs would be enhanced with geophysical data, improving both disease and wellness tracking.  This would enable the full implementation of predictive analytics, enhancing the way researchers track, monitor and eventually predict wellness and disease worldwide.

    This I-Corps project seeks to perform a thorough customer discovery process of 'self-quantification' users and digital health platform providers to identify the most valuable product parameters before formulating our innovation into a market-ready product.  Our innovation provides a seamless platform which empowers consumers to 'self-quantify' by tracking biomarkers at home.  This activity will generate useful data for research studies and predictive/correlative health outcomes. Our turnkey solution enables any mobile health platform with the ability to incorporate smartphone-compatible rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) into its product portfolio while utilizing our software service to securely transmit smartphone-readable diagnostic results to online databases in accordance with government regulations.  This aspect will be an enabling technology for other uses in the expanding mobile health technology ecosystem. Our RDT will use a lateral flow assay sandwich approach utilizing metatype antibodies and gold nanoparticle synthesis. Proprietary smartphone-intelligible patterns will be formed in the presence of urinary biomarkers. The technological implementation of our approach uses gold nanotechnology processes and protocols.  For example, the underlying, fundamental synthesis processes and protocols used to generate core-shell magnetometallic nanoparticles will be utilized in the synthesis of nanozyme nanotechnology which comprises our proposed smartphone-readable rapid diagnostic test.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will
    be to investigate the severity of the healthcare-acquired-infection (HAI) and
    related problems in US hospitals and to lay a foundation to solve the issues by
    employing panels of deep ultra-violet (DUV) light emitting diodes (LEDs) integrated
    with robotic platforms. Human beings are continuously attacked by viruses, bacteria,
    and microbes populating the air, water, and soil. It makes people sick and, in
    some cases, the illness becomes lethal. Special care needs to be taken for immunity
    deficient people in hospitals who are recovering from sickness or surgery. The
    2011 report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that approximately
    722,000 patients in hospitals acquired additional infection and had to stay extra
    ~18 days for treatment. It resulted in additional $30 billion cost to US taxpayers.
    While it is relatively easy to disinfect floors, ceilings, desks, and other flat
    and even surfaces in hospital rooms by DUV light, there are hard-to-reach and
    shadowed areas that require special attention. Our team believes that advent of
    DUV LED integrated with remotely controlled robotic platforms can provide efficient
    disinfection of shadowed areas and thus reduce the number of HAI cases. We are
    in the midst of discussion of testing our robotic prototypes with the administration
    of the Health Division of Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians tribe. It is a great
    opportunity for publicizing   modern health care technologies among Native Americans.
    HAI is a global problem. In the past the United States was a leader in developing
    cutting edge technologies in medicine, telecommunication, defense, and aero-space
    industries. It is therefore vitally important for the US industry to keep producing
    new high-tech products. If an US team can show the path of controlling HAI it
    will definitely have a global impact. \n\nThis I-Corps project is based on the
    discoveries from an ongoing NSF-DMREF project. Our findings have shed light on
    how to overcome the major factors that limit the performance of DUV LEDs. In the
    research space a few unique properties of the PIs invented LEDs have been demonstrated:
    a) improved efficiency of light generation in ultra-thin GaN quantum wells, b)
    better light extraction efficiency, c) enhanced efficiency of carrier injection
    into quantum wells, and d) capability of LEDs to operate at cryogenic temperatures.
    Two provisional patent applications have been filed so far to protect the research
    outcome. Moving forward, our team has built a prototype by integrating commercial
    DUV LEDs with an autonomous robot to ensure human free disinfection of hospital
    rooms. It should be able to reach hard-to-access areas like space under beds and
    tables. We foresee that unique properties of our LEDs will reduce energy consumption
    by 5 times and enhance lifetime of LEDs. It will also lower the operating cost,
    improve disinfection of shadowed areas, and guarantee the absence of mercury,
    commonly found in mercury lamps, to ensure the absence of disposal problems.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

    The broader impact/commercial potential of the I-Corps project is to optimize the efficiency of blood testing by minimizing costs, providing faster results, offering a more painless solution and increasing the convenience of where one?s blood is tested. A direct patient-to-lab interface allows for a new way of testing. This envisioned stand-alone testing kiosk could reach diabetes patients in remote, rural settings both domestically and internationally who have limited access to a healthcare facility. Our diagnostic testing solution could eliminate the need of a healthcare professional allowing blood collection and testing to be a very easy task to accomplish. Our product has the potential to incentivize more patients with blood-related diseases to get their blood tested, leading to quicker diagnosis and a better treatment plan.

    This I-Corps project offers a blood collection device that utilizes a capillary extraction method, which has the potential to extract blood within seconds, rather than the standard venous draw, which takes longer and requires a healthcare professional.  This method may be more painless than typical capillary extractions as the intended site of usage for lancet devices is the finger, which contains more sensitive pain receptors. In some instances we have received input that the constant pricking of a finger has become a nuisance which is why the site of action chosen has been the arm. The issue of vein accuracy is further a contributing factor to the blood collection device functionality as the issue is solved via the capillary method.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    the ability to predict how humans will respond to therapeutic treatment options
    before the clinical trial stage. By testing drug toxicity and efficacy in a human
    model, drugs can get to market more quickly, with less risk and lower costs, while
    potentially reducing the use of animal testing. Currently it takes an average
    of 10 years and $2.8B to get a drug to market, with the majority of the cost due
    to late-stage drug failures. The ability to screen drugs in human organ systems
    that are predictive of in vivo conditions will better inform \"go/no-go\" decision-making
    throughout the stages of drug development. Broader impacts include the ability
    to create clinical trials \"in-a-dish\" where patient populations that will benefit
    the most from the drug versus those that would be at risk can be determined before
    clinical testing. Use of patient-specific cells may enable the development of
    disease models where animal models failed to recapitulate the disease, as well
    as drug testing for rare diseases, where the limited number of affected individuals
    prevents the standard clinical trial format. \n\nThis I-Corps project utilizes
    a modular platform designed to physiologically integrate multiple human tissue
    engineered organ models though vascular connections that mimic how organs are
    connected to one another in the human body. The connected tissue engineered models
    are individually matured prior to integration to provide the high biological fidelity
    needed to accurately recapitulate organ level responses of health and disease.
    The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells enables the use of patient-specific
    cells and gene-edited cells, as well as provides a platform to further precision

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    the product of a mobile, smart gait assessment system allowing for continuous
    gait monitoring outside the clinical settings, which can be used for online, remote
    clinical management for patients with gait disorders including patients with Parkinson
    Disease (PD). PD alone affects over one million people in the United States, a
    number that increases by 60,000 each year. This technology will support the prevention
    of re-admission by fall tracking and prevention, lower hospital visits and length
    of stay by allowing at-home monitoring of disease progression, implement monitored
    wellness programs, differentiate disease types by pattern recognition, and provide
    timely and efficient clinical management by tracking interventional outcomes.
    The patient customers will benefit by receiving recommendations on gait and posture
    habits, leading to a decrease in fall occurrences. Moreover, they will benefit
    from activity monitoring by receiving suggestions on exercise routines, which
    have been shown to increase health and fitness. On the other hand, clinics and
    hospitals will benefit from reducing the volume of patients at their facilities,
    and insurance agencies will benefit by decreasing patients' length of stay.  \n\nThis
    I-Corps project proposes a system capable of detecting asymmetry between kinetic
    and kinematic gait parameters, which consists of embedded inertial measurement
    units and insoles with piezoresistive pressure sensor arrays. With machine learning
    algorithms, the system can detect and classify the disease progression, which
    will support treatment modification along with normal disease course and symptomatic
    changes. This smart, non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical approach for disease prognosis
    could also lead to an increase in participation in clinical trials, as the low-risk
    involvement required could encourage persons with and without PD to participate.
    The developed technology allows for continuous gait recordings outside the clinical
    setting. This smart, wireless gait monitoring system has the potential of decreasing
    the burden associated with the numerous clinic visits. The intellectual merits
    lie in the use of emerging technologies, including cloud computing and artificial
    intelligence for feature extraction, classification, and rare-event detection.
    These features will support medical professionals' decision-making regarding the
    course of treatments from its early stages without having to add more effort to
    their already busy schedules. In addition, the designed Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    architecture will allow mobile health monitoring, including treatment compliance
    and categorization for treatment improvement.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project, based on a portable blood perfusion monitor, lies in its likelihood of reaching new markets and applications beyond current blood perfusion monitor systems. This could have a significant societal impact, as this technology's lower cost compared to other available systems will allow for more routine blood perfusion monitoring (e.g. in preventative medicine), which could improve public health. Further, the compactness and portability of this technology, along with its related elimination of the need for a standalone diagnostic technician, makes its use in healthcare applications in remote and field locations highly feasible. Due to the potential to reach new customers and applications, this technology could be disruptive by addressing unmet needs in diagnostic medicine.

    This I-Corps project is based around a portable blood perfusion monitor device. The device uses laser speckle imaging technology, which images blood flow non-invasively by reflecting low-power laser light off of tissue and into a camera. By capturing several images in rapid succession and comparing the frames, regions with relative motion (in this case, blood flow) can be visually mapped onto an image of the tissue. The intellectual merit of this portable perfusion device is that it utilizes a new method of processing the data to compare the sequential frames, this new method requiring substantially lower computing power than existing methods. As a result, mini-processors can be used in place of full computer processors, allowing for miniaturization of the device and reduction of the material costs. As well, the device is capable of attaching to existing surgical equipment and functions in real time during surgery, shortening time needed for the surgical process and improving timeliness and quality of associated data. Various prototypes of this device have been tested in mice, and the results demonstrate the ability of this device to provide detailed maps of blood flow, including micro-vessels.

    The broader impact of this award is to support the goals of the NSF I-Corps program to increase the economic and societal impact of NSF research funding directly, through enabling commercialization of research, and indirectly, by equipping scientists and engineers with skills and experience in developing and testing economically scalable models for the development of a product or technology. The structured, repeatable program that has been developed engages a national community of institutions and faculty to deliver the training and support these outcomes. Through the work proposed here, this project supports the training of more than 500 additional participants, supports the training of additional faculty to increase the diversity of the faculty pool and maintain fidelity of the program pedagogy, continues conducting systematic data collection and tracking of teams immediately before and long after formal participation in the program, and creates and disseminates datasets of use to both novice and experienced researchers in the field as well as the dissemination of scalable systems for impact measurement that provide both a framework that can be adopted by others in the field.  The systems created through this work, and the insights gained, will advance the understanding of how best to track venture outcomes and assess the impact of early-stage entrepreneurial support programming.

    This NSF project will support the evaluation of I-Corps program outcomes and tracking of program impact in a systematic and timely way.  This work is important to the operation of a consistent, high-fidelity program at scale and to the measurement of long term program results and an understanding of what works. The core intellectual merit of this work is insight into the program's impact, both economic outcomes and participants' career and research outcomes, over time. To gain this insight, the project evaluates the delivery of each cohort, administers a longitudinal outcomes survey, and tracks venture outcomes independently to verify program impact data. Working with NSF, the project makes these datasets accessible to the research community to enable the continued study of how best to support emerging science and technology innovation. The processes and data systems that efficiently track outcomes and provide insights into the development of technology-based products and ventures are a product of this project, as well.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around the human brain?s proclivity towards substances detrimental to human health and wellbeing, such as dangerous amounts of sugar, salt, and drugs, which is causing global health and safety risks. Inability to avoid these temptations shortens lifespans, increases healthcare costs, and strains resources. This team will use machine learning and pattern recognition AI to identify and react to factors that result in destructive human behaviors. While the initial intent of our product is to provide potential customers with a tool to detect and prevent addiction overdose and relapse, offer interventions of supervised individuals, conserve emergency response resources, and save taxpayer money, this unsupervised learning AI could, in subsequent iterations, be used to identify and react to any behavior -- such as unsafe driving, binge eating, or anger management. Helping people identify the precursors to their behaviors could serve as a type of biofeedback that gives them and their support networks timely and individualized insights, preventions, and interventions -- some of which could be implemented by Internet of Things enabled devices (e.g. locking a car?s ignition; calling a sponsor; playing calm music; etc.), resulting in cost and health benefits across many populations.

    This I-Corps project is focused on a patent-pending platform to predict and prevent addiction relapses and overdoses by treating those in recovery with timely interventions using wearable devices and artificial intelligence.  Detecting craving states is supported by past and current research, and there is scientific justification for gathering smartphone usage and biometric wearable data on drug users. Researchers have used the combination of smartphone usage and wearables data to predict binge drinking behavior and we plan to apply this research to opioid use. Additionally, cocaine and opioid research uses the same wearable device as our studies. We expand upon current research by combining just-in-time smartphone-based interventions for people in recovery for opioid use disorders with pattern-detection predictive models that will be trained at the population level and refined at the individual level. We will gather data on all relevant factors that determine drug relapse risk state: physiology, smartphone usage, location data, self-reports, and support-network-reports. Once a high-risk state is detected, a smartphone app-based intervention focused on behavior change will then be implemented in a timely and customizable manner.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is improvements in instrumentation for laparoscopic surgery. During surgery, scope vision may become impaired, requiring scope removal from the body and economic and medical disadvantages. Our technology helps mitigate the need of scope removal from the body by providing a cleaning mechanism. The commercial potential for this technology appears valid at this stage, with broad opportunity to address an established market need.

    This I-Corps project focuses on a technology that can be pictured as a tube, shaft, or long arm with a squeegee at its tip. Its main purpose is to serve as a cleaning mechanism for the far end of an elongated instrument. The intellectual merit of this technology allows for the exploration of cleaning technology application surrounding elongated instruments, with particular opportunity in the medical field. At this stage, proof of concept has been demonstrated with functional prototypes that show acceptable performance. There is particular use for applications where the elongated instrument is constrained within a narrow and/or deep cavity.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems from introducing agricultural-based phase change materials (PCMs) tailored through a bottom-up approach for transforming the strength, durability, and energy efficiency of concrete structures. Considering the volume of concrete used for civil infrastructure applications every year, development of a multifunctional, low-cost, energy-efficient concrete will have a significant impact on transforming the sustainability of the built environment in the United States and potentially worldwide. Since the proposed PCMs will be produced with organic, bio-based polymers, new business and market opportunities are anticipated to be created, especially in the states with a strong agricultural basis. This will not only offer a viable alternative to the current petroleum-based, paraffinic PCMs, but will also have a meaningful contribution to improving the social and economic well-being of communities in both urban and rural areas.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the market potential of concrete materials transformed with (1) agricultural-based PCMs tailored to deliver a high capacity for energy storage and (2) porous lightweight aggregates selected to act as a container for PCMs. One of the distinct features of the proposed PCMs is an adjustable melting temperature, which helps target a range of comfort temperatures and climate zones. Further to performance considerations, the encapsulation method to incorporate PCMs into building envelope components will be one of the main focuses of this project. A number of macro- and micro-encapsulation methods have been developed to date for the use of PCMs in the building sector. Although the micro-encapsulation methods are proven to deliver an acceptable long-term performance, the estimated cost of them is in the range of 45%-65% of the total cost of the system. Exploiting the porous structure of lightweight aggregates commonly used in concrete is expected to eliminate the need to resort to costly encapsulation methods, while contributing to the rapidity and flexibility of construction, depending on customer-specific needs and preferences.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    to eliminate the barriers to the trading of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)
    and to further accentuate the environmental and sustainability value of green
    energy production. A broad societal benefit of a national market for RECS (NaMaREC)
    is the increased adoption of renewable energy technology through projects such
    as community solar and wind farms leading to reduction in carbon footprints. This
    benefit is higher when the increasing need for energy due to growing populations
    is satisfied with more renewable energy. Renewable utilities will benefit from
    NaMaREC since it will allow them to expand their consumer base and reach consumers
    that may be willing to pay more for the certificate. Nonrenewable utilities can
    use NaMaREC to source RECs from cheaper regions, thus reducing their cost of compliance.
    Ultimately, NaMaREC will provide an avenue to communicate the economics of renewable
    energy adoption to the public through extensive interviews of potential customers.
    This project will form partnerships that includes the academia, industry, and
    start-up ventures to launch NaMaREC. \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to develop
    an online marketplace named NaMaREC (National Market for Renewable Energy Certificates)
    for the selling and buying of RECs. A REC is a non-tangible, tradable energy commodity
    in the U.S. that represents proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was
    generated from a renewable energy resource. Currently, there are isolated sellers
    or aggregators of RECs across the U.S. with trades that are neither harmonized
    nor integrated. The business thesis of NaMaREC is to harness the economics of
    scale in the aggregation of RECs in a national market. The underlying motivating
    value for RECs is that 29 states and three territories of the U.S. have a policy
    mandate that requires utilities to generate a certain percentage of their outputs
    from a renewable resource such as solar photovoltaic or wind technology by a target
    date. This mandate, Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), may be satisfied by these
    companies either by building the requisite renewable energy capacity or buying
    RECs to satisfy the RPS requirements. Isolated transactions of RECs have limited
    their market viability and accessibility by firms to meet their state-level RPS.
    NaMaREC will transform the trading of RECs in an integrated service that does
    not currently exist.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    the protective beneficial functions of these communities. Disruption of the microflora
    balance and/or of bacterial attachment to the skin can result in a variety of
    disorders. To promote skin health, the investigators have identified specific
    beneficial skin bacteria, as well as factors that promote the establishment of
    the functional bacterial communities--in particular, naturally produced factors
    that promote the attachment of bacteria to biotic surfaces, such as the skin.
    Based on those results, they have developed a system to balance the skin microbiome

    This I-Corps project is based on deep learning algorithms developed using data from patients with sleep disorders and other neurological conditions. We created a unique deep neural network, composed of both a convolutional and recurrent  modules, and trained the model on a unique set of 10,000 clinical polysomnography (PSG) results, the world's largest collection of clinical PSGs assembled to date.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project revolves around its simplicity and accuracy. The benefit for patients is to enable them and their family members to perform accurate home testing with comfort. Meanwhile, physicians would receive real time diagnostic information about their patients, leading to earlier treatment. For insurance providers and hospitals, costs are drastically reduced as outcomes improve and fewer resources and staff are required. Apart from the healthcare industry, our project would also translate well into the general population, where wearables and health tracking devices are becoming commonplace. Being able to review the framework of one's sleep, with an accurate depiction of multiple characteristics including sleep staging, appeals to the consumer.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project are as follows: Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a method for obtaining 3D structures of biological molecules. The method has growing importance in basic life science research and in the pharmaceutical sector for defining how drugs interact with their targets. Cryo-EM as a whole has matured into a powerful tool in recent years, culminating in the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, but the process of protein 'sample preparation' for 3D study has not advanced appreciably and is widely considered to represent the major bottleneck in the overall method. This bottleneck also presents a major commercial opportunity. The present project advances new nanofluidic-based technology aimed at addressing this bottleneck. Successful development of this technology will yield a consumable product ready for commercialization. Fulfillment of this goal will greatly advance and open new possibilities in cryo-EM structure determination. The resulting acceleration and enhancement of basic science and drug discovery would translate to broad societal benefit.

    This I-Corps project advances a new technology, supported by prototype data, to breach the major bottleneck in the rapidly growing cryo-EM field, with broad impact in life science and drug discovery. Cryo-EM is performed by taking images of frozen proteins using an electron microscope, then processing the images with a computer to obtain a 3D protein structure. To image and obtain a structure, the protein sample must first be frozen into a thin layer (~50-200 nm). With existing technology, this process is poorly controlled, lacks reproducibility and substantially adds to the time required to get a structure. Our device is designed to directly mitigate these sample preparation problems. It is a self-contained, freezable fluid cell nanofabricated to specification, giving full control over sample geometry and protein environment. Protein is passively loaded into the fluid cell, the loaded device is frozen, and can then be imaged directly. Materials on the top and bottom of the fluid cell are selected to transmit the electron beam through the protein sample with minimal noise. Successful prototype testing and data collection has shown the viability of the core design, with future work focused on refining the design and materials and streamlining manufacturing for eventual commercialization.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of autonomous robotic systems to save lives across multiple disaster levels by multiplying human efforts in areas such as disaster response, extending to reduced response times and improved rescue efforts during disaster relief. Using autonomous systems, such as drones, that run software which allows for the use of biosensors and on-board machine learning, natural disaster responders can find survivors faster and reduce casualties. The technology understands mission objectives (intent-driven), coordinates with others (collaborative autonomy) and is voice enabled (natural language conversational interface), allowing it to work well with both humans and machines. These and other features lend this technology to broad commercial applications, offering the best strategy to mitigate multiple disaster levels - at the district or provincial level by assessing strengths and vulnerabilities to various hazards; at the community level like search and rescue during a flood or fire; and at the household level like ambulatory drone service care for the aging.

    This I-Corps project will be focused on translating scientific research to commercialization through lessons on the business model canvas and extensive customer discovery. Our research has involved hands-on technical experimentation using deep/machine learning software for prototype development and literature reviews on a variety of software capabilities. Using a camera with machine learning, we were able to identify a human with most of the body obscured. Hardware acts as transport for the optical and acoustical biosensor package which can take action autonomously by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies extending to: realtime onboard object detection capable of identifying a person in rubble, even when the person is partially obscured (Machine/Deep Learning/edge), offline cloud-enriched datasets for cloud-sourced analysis, voice recognition/conversational natural language processing/speech synthesis. Blockchain enabled autonomous swarm management technology on multiple robotic devices will enable multiple machine collaboration. All sensor data is time-stamped and stored in the cloud where the AI technologies are used to enrich the data. Enriched data is made available offline via the internet to thousands of volunteers for human review. Results from our research show that the technological capability exists, the software and hardware components combined meet a need established through our initial customer discovery.

    to optimize outcomes for patients with certain kinds of heart disease and thus
    reduce healthcare costs. We have developed a virtual reality surgical planning
    tool which allows us to better understand which patients are at high risk, and
    better plan surgeries for them. If this tool becomes widely used, the benefits
    could include improving overall outcomes for people with structural heart disease,
    leading to fewer reinterventions, shorter hospital stays, lower healthcare costs,
    and improved quality of life. In addition, these tools may also be useful to neurosurgeons
    and orthopedic surgeons. Finally, if medical education is improved through virtual
    reality, this would lead to better physicians with more knowledge of anatomy.
    Regarding commercial impact, the project has multiple potential commercialization
    pathways. First, end users such as pediatric cardiologists and cardiothoracic
    surgeons can use the virtual reality surgical planning tool for their own patients.
    Further, medical device companies that make valves could use the software to teach
    physicians optimal ways to use their products, and to differentiate from their
    competitors. Finally, imaging companies could package this as the next stage of
    radiology interpretation software. \n\nThis I-Corps project focuses on planning
    structural heart disease interventions and surgeries using true 3D visualization
    with modern virtual reality techniques. These interventions require a detailed
    understanding of how different parts of the anatomy relate to each other in space.
    The development of true 3D visualization has enabled new ways of understanding
    these relationships. Already, it has been shown that the use of 3D printing in
    planning complex cases of congenital heart disease can improve surgical decision-making.
    This resulted in fewer cases where the surgeon had to change her mind about which
    surgery to perform after opening the chest. One would therefore expect better
    outcomes and greater patient satisfaction if the expected procedure is done. In
    addition, early reports suggest that virtual reality may be useful in improving
    surgical education. The virtual reality system in this project has already been
    used to plan innovative heart interventions that were previously not considered
    feasible. What is yet unknown is the extent of the effect on longer-term patient
    outcomes, both within congenital heart disease and in adult structural heart disease.
    Further development of virtual reality surgical planning tools will allow the
    field to advance as we investigate the contribution virtual reality can make.\n\nThis

    The CT-RCEM has the potential to transform the RCM market and bring unique benefits
    to end users that include universities, government research laboratories, automotive
    industry and oil and gas industry. \n\nThis I-Corps project uses a precise motion
    controller with a high speed large force electrohydraulic actuator to mitigate
    the most fundamental limitation of the conventional RCM, an inherently rigid actuation
    system. The typical operation of an RCM involves, as the name suggests, rapid
    compression of air-fuel mixture by high speed motion of a piston in combustion
    chamber, leading to the ignition of the fuel. The associated data provides valuable
    insight into the combustion characteristics. However, the piston trajectory during
    this compression process is highly facility dependent and any changes in the operating
    parameters require hardware intervention and subsequent recalibration, leading
    to repeatability and reproducibility issues as well as a long turnaround time
    between experiments. The controlled trajectory rapid compression and expansion
    machine alleviates this limitation with its precisely controllable actuation system.
    The piston motion profile can be changed by digitally changing the piston reference
    trajectory assigned to the motion controller. This ability to tailor the piston
    trajectory allows the CT-RCEM to provide significant advantages and new capabilities
    over the conventional RCM.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and
    has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is pivoted around the emerging whole slide imaging market segment in digital pathology. The digital pathology market is predicted to reach over $800 million by 2025. The motivation of this project stems from the gigabyte size of whole slide images (WSIs), which are digital images of glass slides produced at near optical resolution. With rapid increase in the number of WSIs produced by hospitals and pathology labs, the storage and management of WSIs has become an urgent problem to tackle for next-generation image analytics. The commercial viability of the project can significantly impact researchers, medical professionals, software developers, and IT staff who wish to manage large number of WSIs using modern cluster computing and big data techniques. Thus, next-generation image analytics (e.g., using deep learning) for automatic detection and analysis of cellular and morphological features in human tissues can be performed faster on large numbers of WSIs. The potential societal benefit of the project includes enabling improved diagnosis of diseases by pathologists using next-generation image analytics and the creation of a tech startup leading to new jobs. This project will provide training to two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups in STEM.

    This I-Corps project is based on a software technology that aims to solve the fundamental problem of scalable storage of WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles using a commodity cluster and big data techniques. The value proposition of the technology is efficient and cost-effective storage of large-scale WSIs and fast retrieval of tiles to enable next-generation image analytics for human disease diagnosis. The technology encompasses intelligent data partitioning using space-filling curves, in-memory data structures, and effective organization of tiles to enable fast retrieval of tiles during image analysis. It employs space-efficient storage formats to maximize storage efficiency. On an average, it required a few seconds to retrieve a single tile on 80 WSIs using a 16-node cluster. Therefore, we believe next-generation image analytics on WSIs (e.g., using deep learning) can run faster on large number of WSIs, which can consume terabytes of storage, through faster access of image tiles. As the technology relies on commodity hardware and open source software, it is cost-effective and can be easily deployed as a product or a service. The technology has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in WSI storage and management using a big data approach.

    to  monitor  sleep quality of individuals and report sleep quality index and sleep
    architecture using an ambient connected sensor. This project will potentially
    improve quality of care in some patient populations such as Alzheimer/Dementia
    patients and infants by enabling sleep quality assessment using a non-intrusive
    technology.   The passive sensor we have developed can precisely detect entire
    sleep stages as well as any abnormalities related to breathing or movement during
    sleep. The sensor is placed outside of bed and does not pose discomfort to the
    patient. It is our goal to offer a sleep sensor that will be an essential part
    of our healthy lifestyle choices.  The sensor must be non-intrusive and ambient
    to be widely accepted. Wearable or body-contact sensors take away from the natural
    sensation of sleep and might create a feeling of being monitored. For this reason,
    we believe an ideal sleep monitor should be ambient and easily blend in with the
    accessories on the bedside table. This monitor will enable the same kind of diagnostic
    power available in a hospital, to the comfort of our bedrooms. \n\nThis I-Corps
    project proposes a sleep monitor based on a passive infrared sensing technology
    which utilizes a pyroelectric material for temperature sensing.  The material
    is lithium tantalate, a crystal that has pyroelectric properties. A change in
    ambient temperature creates a change in polarization of the crystal. This change
    creates a potential across the crystal and a charge is generated similar to a
    capacitor.  The generated charge is collected by electrodes thus we obtain the
    voltage response of the pyroelectric detector.  Under constant and ambient temperature,
    the response quickly approaches steady state. Due to the thermal time constant,
    the crystal will quickly thermalize to its environment after input. Thus, we observe
    a 'voltage pulse' mechanism when there is a fast change (physical movement) against
    the background. This property makes our sensor very sensitive to fluctuations
    against the background temperature distribution and allows it to accurately detect
    fine movements such as chest motion during breathing.  We use these fine chest
    movements to detect respiration and heart rate which in turn are used to  determine
    the sleep stage.  We use respiration rate variability to determine sleep stages
    and derive sleep quality index using sophisticated signal processing methods.\n\nThis

- abstractText: |-
    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project derives from its promise to positively affect not only consumers, but also enhance efficiencies in the electric energy marketplace as a whole. The basic functionality of matching users to optimal electric plans will result in both higher consumer satisfaction, and result in Retail Electric Providers (REPs) offering more competitive rate packages.  Identifying the actual usage profile of appliances over time and providing actionable information to consumers will enable consumers to take informed decisions on appliance purchases, as well as manufacturers to optimize designs with real-world inputs.   The platform will enable the solution of system-wide problems faced by utility companies like peak period demand surges to be countered through demand response initiatives such as incentivizing customers to modify their usage patterns to smoothen the load curve.  Each function of the proposed system is geared toward addressing a specific source of friction in the electric energy marketplace, and consequently also possesses commercial potential.  Thus, the overall economic impact will be on consumers, REPs, utility companies and appliance manufactures, while promoting a greater knowledge and engagement among the electricity consumers.

    This I-Corps project explores the value of creating a bundled energy management system aimed at residential users.  The system uses machine-learning-based analytics of the customer's daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal energy usage trends to offer potential savings through (1) recommending the best retail energy service provider plan matching the customer's usage patterns, (2) incentivizing customers to enable full integration with smart home devices, including smart thermostats, (3) identifying and predicting the electricity consumption of different appliances and providing actionable information on their optimal usage and maintenance, and (4) services to allow customers to navigate through the process of switching plans. A smartphone app available for the iOS and Android platforms forms the customer interface to the system.  The key novelties of this project lie in the development and integration of machine learning tools and behavioral economics ideas into the domain of residential energy management.  The project is founded on research into the design, development and validation of such tools in contexts such as predicting residential energy usage over time, disaggregating usage on a per-appliance basis, and experimentation on how best to motivate users to engage in energy usage behavior that induces efficient grid operation.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a significantly improved in-field data collection and data analysis workflow.  This technology leverages the widespread use of smartphones around the world by providing a robust digital platform with low hardware requirements for collecting and understanding data.  By digitizing inputs from the beginning of the data collection process and providing live analysis, the platform reduces the cost, time, and expertise required to collect and understand the information contained within datasets.  The technology can benefit diverse industries, but has particular application to municipal governments and NGOs, where project managers need to regularly monitor the effect of their program.  Their ability to do so and make the necessary adjustments directly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the projects.  The technology has significant commercial potential beyond governments and NGOs, and impacts any industry that requires rapid and reliable data insights for decision making.  Over time, the technology will make data collection and usage more accessible to empower average people to better advocate for their community.

    This I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a fully digital in-field data platform. The technology allows any team to quickly collect and analyze in-field data.  A robust software platform forms the core of the technology. The platform automatically tags data with GPS and time information and provides live visualization of data and team activity with minimal hardware requirements. Advanced mobile algorithms manage data caching and cloud uploading. These algorithms enable the platform to operate reliably in areas with intermittent internet connection and protect data during hardware crashes. This fully digital process reduces the cost and time required to compile and interpret in-field datasets so valuable insights can be gained quickly and cheaply to facilitate data-driven decision making.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the ability to have a standardized quality of craniofacial surgery by providing accuracy and flexibility, improved patient outcome & satisfaction, reduced number of surgeries and intraoperative time resulting in reduced cost of care and patient morbidity. Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.

    This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration. These results indicated the possibility of overcoming the current shortcomings in osseous tissue regeneration.

    \ The application of our materials will enable more advanced experiments, leading

    photon upconversion at very low excitation densities, much cheaper non-coherent
    light sources such as red LEDs can replace the high power near-infrared lasers
    currently required today. This is ideal for point of care testing for personalized

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    that it will lay the foundation for developing a novel ?rechargeable? antimicrobial
    coating product that is easily applied to, and absorbed by, a wide variety of
    surfaces, to prevent the transmission of contaminants. In the food industry, this
    antimicrobial coating product could help to reduce the public health risk and
    burden due to foodborne illness outbreaks and reduce economic losses for food
    industry due to spoilage or pathogenic microorganism contamination. For the health
    care industry, the coating could provide a low-cost and highly-effective option
    for preventing the cross-contamination of drug-resistant microorganism or ?superbugs?
    on communal environmental surfaces in hospitals and health care facilities. If
    new products are successfully developed and go to market, it will bring economical
    reward to the society and improve human life quality. Ultimately, it can help
    to strengthen the US food and health care industries and reduce the cost of government
    budget for public health.\n  \nThis I-Corps project is based on a novel N-halamine-based
    antimicrobial coating material that can be ?recharged? through simply treating
    with chlorine bleach. This polymer material was designed to overcome several shortcomings
    of current antimicrobial coatings. There are two critical innovations of our antimicrobial
    coating material: 1) broad, potent, and rechargeable biocidal function; 2) strong
    and versatile absorbance on surfaces regardless of materials, sizes, and shapes.
    We have done a significant amount of work to synthesize, formulate, and prototype
    the coatings on substrate materials (stainless steels and plastics) that are commonly
    used for fabricating food and health care equipment and facilities. We have also
    scaled up for coating and testing on real food equipment parts including metal
    pipes and plastic conveyor belts. The preliminary data are very promising. We
    are planning to do trials in the food manufacturing plants using our N-halamine
    coating soon. Ultimately, the complex problems and challenges in real application
    environments will inspire more intensive fundamental research to advance knowledge
    and understanding in food science, environmental microbiology, and antimicrobial

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project involves the optimization of human resource deployment via technology. More specifically, this endeavor leverages systems research to inform software with machine learning to inform how to organize work across industries and align that work with available human resources in a manner that optimizes outcomes. This technology can serve to benefit diverse industries; however, it offers unique value for healthcare settings which often have scare human resources deployed in rapidly changing environments. In clinical environments, how care is organized can have significant implications for cost, quality, and outcomes. This software will collect and analyze large volumes of data related to individuals and the environment to organize and assign work optimally (i.e. to improve clinical outcomes, decrease costs and increase efficiency). This technology has significant commercial potential beyond healthcare environments to any industry that routinely organizes and assigns work to a workforce where considerations of individual characteristics and environmental characteristics have significance.

    This I-Corps project involves pursuits focused on better understanding the application potential of research-driven technology in various industries with a specific focus on inpatient clinical environments (i.e. hospitals). The technology automates and optimizes nurse staffing in hospital settings. It uses a data-driven algorithm informed by qualitative and quantitative research to make nurse-patient assignments that improve outcomes, save time, and reduce stress. The research driving this technology is inclusive of a review and synthesis of relevant nursing, health systems, and work science literature as well as qualitative research involving interviews of nurses and quantitative research assessing relationships between inpatient clinical work environments and patient outcomes. The technology integrates research data from nurses, patients, and hospital structural factors to inform algorithms driving nurse-patient matches. Machine learning elements of the software facilitate this optimization process. The software also serves as a mechanism for collecting a unique data set that records patient-nurse ?exposures? on the individual level and on an unprecedented scale. Such a data set is of great value to health services researchers, hospital quality improvement teams, and to our team as it seeks to improve and customize the algorithm with potential to decrease costs of care and improve patient and nurse outcomes.

    be the improvement of the quality of lives of both the individuals with Autism
    Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their caregivers. The prevalence of autism has increased
    by 15% in 2014. Now, 1 in 59 children born in the US has ASD. This translates
    to roughly 5.5 million individuals in the US who are less likely to go to college
    or find a job after high school. Our user-friendly, discreet device can help affected
    individuals gain independence and create a supportive learning or working environment
    for them. Pre-emptive meltdown detection and care devices are virtually non-existent
    in the current marketplace. As the first to enter the market at an affordable
    price point, we expect to lead and spawn derivative products. Beyond autism, our
    platform technology can be utilized to push data to a healthcare professional,
    catalyzing informed and personalized preventive care. Other conceivable application
    is monitoring compliance and measuring the effectiveness of rehabilitation exercises
    for muscle engagement of stroke patients. Our innovation also has the potential
    to reach and assist those affected by other types of anxiety disorders. It can
    help people become more informed about their own mental health, intervene, and
    lead healthier lives. \n\nThis I-Corps project involves wearable technology for
    predicting, detecting, tracking, and mitigating meltdowns for individuals with
    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have developed a biometric sensing suite comprising
    two components: The hardware portion consists of a detachable, water-resistant
    core unit for biosignal filtering, processing, and transmission as well as machine
    washable sensors that can be embedded into apparel; The software portion consists
    of our proprietary machine learning models for determination of when a meltdown
    is to occur, alerting the parent or caregiver of a high risk of a meltdown, and
    an assessment of mitigation techniques afterwards. Our innovation will advance
    autism research, as the technology has the potential to open the doors to a better
    understanding of behavioral phenotypes. Being able to tell what a non-verbal child
    is feeling can pave the way for more efficient and productive lessons for social/education
    development as well as broader phenotypical research. The assessment feature of
    our product will lead to the improvement of mitigation techniques for meltdowns.
    gaia's competitive advantage is in its pre-emptive nature of care. Proof-of-concept
    was demonstrated, and a beta prototype will be complete by the end of Summer 2018.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project's technology, based on computing, engineering and materials technologies, may provide a sense of safety and comfort to anosmics (those who suffer from a loss of a sense of smell).  People with a loss of their sense of smell are typically  concerned about being near potential hazards that are difficult to detect without a sense of smell, such as fires, gas leaks, food that is spoiling, and hazardous chemicals. As there are no methods or products that can closely mimic the human nose, the detection performance and user-friendliness of a substitute device will target a relatively untapped market -- approximately 5% of the general population or over 15 million people in the United States alone. It is anticipated that this project's device will be a more affordable, reliable and less invasive alternative to surgery or other treatments. Furthermore, the technology can be used in a wide range of applications, such as drug or explosives detection, food quality monitoring (such as identifying diseases and/or ripeness of fruits and other produce), air quality monitoring and control, harmful solvent detection for defense application, and smart bandage for wound monitoring.

    This I-Corps project involves the manufacture of a device with a high-density, high-performance gas sensor array based on nanotechnology, chemistry, computer science and engineering. The facile, fast fabrication methods of nanomaterials as sensing materials introduces the possibility of mass manufacturing. Real-time response to a range of gas analytes along with fast recovery of the sensing medium provides a solid technical foundation for this project. Currently at a pre-alpha prototyping stage, the device, with its full integration with a custom-designed circuit board and precisely fabricated sensing nanomaterials, not only eliminates the need for tedious and costly microfabrication, which is typical for gas sensors, but may also be able to imitate the detection level of a human nose, even exceeding the detection performance for some gas analytes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to understand the problems that the industry and federal agencies face during the operation of underwater vehicles for applications such as, ocean monitoring, inspection of coastal structures, rescue missions and/or hydrographic survey. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are key for multiple underwater missions including detecting and mapping submerged wrecks, ocean bed-floor, polluted water, as well as surveillance of coastal zones and coastal structures. In many circumstances AUVs are preferred over conventional towed instruments or marine surface vehicles because AUVs can get closer to the area of interest, they can cover large areas without constant monitoring or hover hazardous areas without putting at risk humans life. Although current AUVs have many capabilities, one main limitation is their inability to perform precise station-keeping which allows the vehicle to hold its position and adjust for currents. New technology in underwater propulsion will permit the development and control of a new generation of highly maneuverable vessels that have to operate in more challenging environments. The proposed work is expected to increase the partnership between academia, marine industries and national defense agencies. In addition, it will promote the progress of science and national security using bio-inspired technology.

    This I-Corps project focuses in the propulsion technology and control strategy for AUVs that needs to operate in tight space, low-speed with high mobility and perform station-keeping missions. Bio-inspired undulating fin can provide multiple advantages including: superior maneuverability to control forward motion and directional maneuver with a single undulating fin; precise maneuvers suitable for station-keeping and maneuvers in tight spaces; reduce risk to get tangled in marine plants and ropes with less impact on the marine ecosystem; relative low speed with likely lower acoustic signature.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project has to do with impacts on global markets that involve catalysts.  Catalysts influence many fields in science and technology such as material science, electrochemical processes, nano science and energy storage technologies.  These areas represent some of the most rapidly evolving global sciences and applications. The novel catalyst material that is the basis of this project will likely have commercial impact in global markets in that 60% of chemical synthesis and 90% of chemical transformations in chemical industries are currently dependent on the catalysts. According to the North American Catalysis Society, approximately 35% of global GDP depends on catalysts and the use of catalysts in the industry is increasing by 5% every year. With the growing market need of catalyst materials and the facile synthesis methodology for large scale production, this project's catalyst can be a potential game changer in the global market.

    This I-Corps project is primarily intended to identify the market need and characterize the technological gap to commercialize a  recently developed nano catalyst based on metal-organic framework-modified nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G/MOF) for oxygen reduction reaction applications. The modification of the nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) catalyst by metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) has been developed to enhance the catalytic and electrochemical performance of N-G catalysts. The MOF-modified N-G catalyst (N-G/MOF) has high catalytic performance due to high surface area and porosity, which has better performance than the conventional precious group metal (PGM) catalyst. The innovative and economically viable synthesis method using nano high energy wet (NHEW) ball milling was developed for the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene catalyst in room temperature environments. The NHEW ball milling synthesis method offers a long-term solution to the primary challenges generated during the high-temperature synthesis process, and serve as the primary synthesis method for the industry-scale production of the N-G/MOF catalyst in the future.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the decentralization of diagnostic blood testing. Existing point-of-care clinics are limited to a narrow range of diagnostic capabilities as they currently do not possess simple methods to perform blood-plasma separation. High Efficiency Rapid Magnetic Erythrocyte Separator (H.E.R.M.E.S) offers a highly efficient solution to meet the needs of sample processing in point-of-care environments and its commercialization will enable the translation of existing diagnostic tests from traditional labs to more accessible clinical settings. Access to rapid sample processing capabilities will also ensure retention of sample integrity and reduce the incidences of inaccurate diagnosis that may result from poor sample storage. Further, H.E.R.M.E.S is highly suitable to integrate into the healthcare infrastructure of resource-limited settings as it can provide low-cost sample processing capabilities. Successful deployment will result in an increased accessibility to testing services and will potentially allow point-of-care clinics to capture a greater percentage of the blood-testing market

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of a translational method to perform blood-plasma separation. H.E.R.M.E.S uses magnetic bead-based separation to obtain plasma free of red blood cells in a short amount of time. H.E.R.M.E.S is a low-cost and standalone platform that has the potential to augment the testing efficiency and translational ability of existing blood-based diagnostic tests. H.E.R.M.E.S will address the lack of availability of low-cost and efficient sample processing technologies; a barrier that prevents existing point-of-care clinics from offering in-house blood testing services. Current experiments show that H.E.R.M.E.S offers performance similar to that of a centrifuge (near 100% plasma purity) at a fraction of the time and cost (process time of 2 minutes at less than $2 per test). The underlying research complements ongoing work in developing point-of-care medical technologies to perform diagnostic testing in the field. The technology utilizes inexpensive raw materials that are readily available, and the process flow has been designed to ensure semi-autonomous operation ? key factors that indicate favorable scale-up potential.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to eliminate antibiotic use during biomanufacturing in the chemical and biotechnology industries, and to enable robust, contamination-free continuous processes that reduce upstream costs by 20-50%. Currently the biotechnology industry is growing at an astounding 7.5% per annum with a predicted value of $760B by 2025.  However, industrial fermentation plant failure data collected over a 15-year period suggests that 1 in 10 process cultures are subject to microbial contamination and associated production failure. Furthermore, while continuous bioreactor processes significantly improve productivity and reduce unit operation costs, most biotechnology industries shy away from them because of the inherent sensitivity to contamination.  Reduced bioreactor failure rate and operational cost is essential for the economic viability of bio-commodity chemicals such as biofuels, as production costs are a big impediment to large-scale manufacture; and their market demand depends primarily on their price competitiveness with petroleum-derived counterparts. Our technology can increase the productivity and profit margin of these companies. With our technology, large-scale bio-commodity chemicals production could become economically feasible. In addition to reduced operational costs, antibiotic-free production alleviates antibiotic misuse in industries to promote a positive environmental and public heath impact.

    This I-Corps project comprises a novel biocide/biocide-resistant system that could be used to treat and prevent microbial contamination in bioreactors. This technology allows bioprocessing engineers to eliminate the microbial contamination problem by addition of a biocide into the bioprocessing hosts' growth medium. The biocide prohibits the outgrowth of accidental contaminants while a biocide-resistant enzyme protects the bioprocessing host. The system also contains an on/off switch that allows easy removal of the biocide as needed. Preliminary data demonstrates that heterologous expression of the biocide-resistant enzyme in Escherichia coli and subsequent directed evolution resulted in a biocide-resistant Escherichia coli with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) approximately 16 times higher than the negative controls. We further demonstrate that this biocide in combination with the expression of biocide-resistant enzyme can be used to successfully treat a contaminated bioreactor.

    a novel technology for the detection and the surveillance of cancer. Assays known
    as ?liquid biopsies? seek to diagnose or monitor cancer by surveying small amounts
    of body fluids for cancer biomarkers can be confounded by contaminants. This project
    will examine the potential of a novel ?silicon nanomembrane? device to serve the
    liquid biopsy market by purifying cancer biomarkers quickly and with high purity.
    By enabling cancer to be discovered early, the technology could dramatically impact
    the cost of cancer care. In bladder cancer surveillance for example, a liquid
    biopsy assay could replace invasive and expensive cystoscopy exams with simple
    urinalysis. In addition to its potential to lower US health care costs, the project
    is expected to have regional impact through the addition of a new commercial enterprise
    or the growth of an existing nanomembrane manufacturer. \n\nThis I-Corps project
    will investigate the commercial potential of a novel device for the capture of
    naturally occurring vesicles, called exosomes, from raw body fluids. These vesicles
    are released by tumor cells into body fluids and thus have tremendous potential
    in cancer diagnostics. Current exosome purification techniques are labor intensive
    and co-purify exosomes with protein. We have discovered that our ultrathin nanoporous
    silicon nitride (NPN) membranes can capture and purify large quantities of exosomes
    from biofluids when used in simple microfluidic devices. We have also developed
    sophisticated nanomembranes featuring photonic structures that could be used to
    determine the molecular composition of exosomes. Through interviews with potential
    customers, we will attempt to identify a minimum viable product that could gain
    early traction in the market. We will also seek to define the features of a more
    sophisticated product concept that could be transformative to cancer diagnosis.
    We hope to emerge from the experience with a clear value proposition and an understanding
    of the infrastructure and partnerships we will need to make a new commercial enterprise.\n\nThis

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is based on a new material that has the capability to reduce skin morbidity in amputees. Skin morbidity is an especially critical concern for patients with decreased wound healing capability because of vascular diseases such as diabetes and endovascular disease. Most current commercially available wound liners intended to avoid decreased wound healing have additions or modifications to base materials that target skin health. These include medicated coatings, cooling systems, and vacuum attachments. However, they do not correct the root of the problem - they aim to treat the secondary problems caused by those materials: heat, sweat, pistoning, and potential of microbial growth. Thus, more preventative technologies are called for than those that will only treat already developed skin wear or infection. This project's technology will not only transform the prosthetic liner industry, but also offer a new approach for other situations that might lead to skin infection issues.

    This I-Corps project combines multiple materials with favorable properties into a single polymeric system that retains a liner's mechanical robustness while wicking away heat and sweat from limb-prosthesis interfaces.  While similar polymeric structures have been used as membranes as well as drug delivery systems, they could be incorporated to the liner materials to improve the liner functioning. This project produces a breathable sleeve with minimal skin irritation, essential for amputees. The in situ production of these liners enables prosthetist and physicians to customize the shape of liners in real time to best meet the need of individuals.

    The broader impact/commercialization potential of this I-Corps project involves the application of multi-sensor technologies to  improve the management and treatment of patients with implanted catheters. Catheter blockage and failure results in ineffective treatment, leading to life-threatening symptoms. Hydrocephalus patients are particularly vulnerable due to their life-long dependence on implanted catheters and suffer significantly due to high implant failure rate (>40% in year 1, >80% within a decade). Over one million Americans currently live with hydrocephalus, and require constant drainage of cerebrospinal fluid via implanted catheter. Repeated imaging studies and invasive procedures are used to monitor catheter performance, but these methods are expensive and inadequate. MRI/CT imaging can identify catheter failure in fewer than 50% of cases. Even when combined with invasive tests, patients are often misdiagnosed and undergo unnecessary surgery. Noninvasive monitoring of hydrocephalus catheter status could eliminate expensive tests and unnecessary operations, saving the US healthcare system $2 billion annually and immeasurably improve patient quality of life. Numerous other diseases in the cardiovascular, urinary, and renal spaces also require chronically implanted catheters and would benefit from noninvasive catheter monitoring. Improving catheter monitoring would also increase scientific knowledge of chronic diseases, providing an important tool for research and therapy development.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercialization potential for a multi-sensor catheter which can be implanted in the human body. Few sensors exist on the market that can operate for long periods in the human body. There are no suitable sensor technologies for chronically implanted catheters. This team developed a new sensor technology based on microscale electrodes that are low profile and eliminate the need for encapsulation or protection against the harsh environments found in vivo. They are made only of inert biocompatible materials, such as platinum and Parylene C, which have long been used in FDA approved medical implants. The pressure sensor operates by monitoring the response of a microbubble to changes in pressure. The flow sensor uses a microscopic heater and electrodes to measure heat transfer via flowing fluid. The sensor measures the electrical signal between electrodes inside and outside of a catheter to measure blockage. Clinical tests of these sensors are currently underway in pediatric patients with external ventricular drains.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a new modality for delivering effective substance abuse interventions. This project involves a novel virtual-reality based intervention to be applied in substance abuse treatment. The team plans to investigate customer potential for a turnkey software intervention that can be integrated into the treatment of substance use disorders. This intervention may save lives and money by significantly reducing relapse rates.

    This I-Corps project explores how virtual reality may be an immediately available intervention to prevent relapse during periods of craving. Preliminary interviews suggest that virtual reality can regulate emotion for a period of hours or days after a brief 30-minute session. Substance abuse develops as a maladaptive response to strong negative emotions - if virtual reality can regulate emotion, it may serve as an alternative behavior that can be sought during potential moments of relapse. Prevention of relapse could combat the opioid epidemic and also help the millions of people who are addicted to other substances.

    to bring more usable technology to elderly populations to help them age with greater
    independence.  Specifically, existing in-home robots could assist a broader cohort
    of elderly users if the robots were easier to understand and use.  This is an
    especially timely opportunity as the elderly population is quickly growing in
    the United States. Elderly users need a robot that can express many internal states
    through external features, especially in an intuitive and interactive way. Choreographers
    and theater artists recognize how to convey narrative through context (set), movement
    (choreography), and commands (dialogue), therefore bringing a special expertise
    beyond typical product design processes.  Marrying this expertise with robotic
    hardware development has the potential to produce a significant transformation
    in how aging adults relate to and take advantage of technology in their homes.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial potential of a three-part
    design methodology that has been developed to layer robotic systems with greater
    expressiveness and understandable features. This method 1) creates systems with
    appropriate expressive bandwidth to communicate internal state to human viewers
    through motion profiles, 2) helps users understand how to interact with robotic

    context-based behavior, with existing, low-cost robot hardware. For example, something
    as simple as a heart rate monitor has opaque, hard to interpret monitors, confusing
    multiple-step procedures, and an ominous beeping. This novel approach adds a customizable
    expressive layer to an existing device like this, creates a character-driven narrative
    about how the device works, and uses theatrical context which may improve user
    adoption via priming.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to increase the availability of cost-effective automated 3D bioprinting platforms capable of reconstructing biological tissue in situ. Existing bioprinting technology is limited and only available to institutions with vast amounts of resources, therefore limiting the potential it can bring to both academic and non-academic sectors. In industry, industry, many late stage trials can fail due to inaccurate drug testing and errors in the translational gap when using animal models. As an alternative, testing on 3D printed human tissue models could reduce costs as a valuable intermediate step before proceeding to animal model testing. Second, 3D bioprinting applications in pharmaceutical companies will increase throughput in drug screening. Third, researchers in academia can further advances in 3D biomaterial engineering. Fourth, with the education sector moving towards a Next Generation Science Standards curriculum, bioprinters have immense potential as an innovative tool for hands-on learning in the classroom. Educators can utilize 3D bioprinting as a powerful teaching tool to train and empower the next generation of scientists in pursuing their research. Ultimately, this project aims to create a positive impact and improve technological access worldwide for researchers and students alike.

    This I-Corps project is based on a core technology that allows researchers to print various tissue constructs. This bioprinter is able to reconstruct a viable skin construct using human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The project?s minimum viable product (MVP) is a bioprinter with a multi-modular system using three different technologies. The technologies used in this product enable on-demand biomaterial customization during the construction of a 3D high-fidelity scaffold and precision placement of cells down to the micron level. Together, the combination of these modules creates a versatile product that has broad applications. This development will improve accessibility of the bioprinting technology and will further advancements in tissue engineering.

    the introduction of a new microscopy modality, which enables non-contact mechanical
    mapping, and the development of the corresponding add-on module compatible to
    commercial confocal microscopy instruments. Confocal microscopy instruments are
    widely used in academia and industry but do not provide mechanical information
    of samples; mechanical testing instruments are also ubiquitous in both academia
    and industry but are contact-based. This project brings the non-contact mechanical
    testing capability to optical microscopy instruments. Beyond enabling traditional
    material characterizations with high spatio-temporal resolution, the instrument
    will be highly impactful in biomedical research. The past two decades have seen
    increasing recognition of the prominent role of the mechanical interplay between
    cells and their local microenvironment to regulate cell function. A widely utilized
    optical microscope for cell biomechanics would accelerate our understanding of
    mechano-chemical pathways and their role in the control of biological processes.
    Thus, this instrument is expected to be broadly used by biomedical researchers
    and material scientists in industry and academia to access cell, tissue and biomaterial
    mechanical properties without perturbing the sample and with high 3D resolution.
    \ \n\nThis I-Corps project explores the commercialization of an add-on module
    for confocal microscopes that features novel Brillouin spectroscopy.  Brillouin
    spectroscopy has been widely used for material testing and environmental sensing
    since the 1970's using specialized spectrometers that required 10 min to hours
    for a single measurement. In recent years, a new type of spectrometer was developed
    to improve speed of acquisition by several orders of magnitude and allowed to
    obtain 3D elasticity maps of biomaterials, biological cells and tissues. Thanks
    to the integration in commercial confocal microscopes, several highly impactful
    areas (e.g. stem cell lineage differentiation, malignancy transformation) will
    benefit from this technology as it enables gathering biomechanical information
    in environments and settings such as 3D microenvironments that mimic the in vivo
    conditions.  In addition, the instrument will enable the study of cell biomechanics
    on microfluidic platforms in order to control microenvironment conditions. Being
    compatible with traditional optical microscopes, this technology can also be combined
    with force mapping modalities thus enabling to investigate how cells sense mechanical
    stimuli and transduce them into biochemical signals.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to reduce production costs of high-quality stem and primary cells for regenerative medicine (RM), consequently reducing medical expenses and improving the quality of life for individuals. RM has a projected global market of $67.6 billion by 2020, and is capable of repairing, replacing and regenerating tissues and organs that are affected by disease/disorder, age, or injury. The common cell harvesting methods cause severe damage to cells, especially primary cells and stem cells. Our technology allows harvesting damage free cells, i.e., retaining essential cell functionalities and characteristics, which are superior for RM. Damage free cells will also enhance basic life science research by obtaining more clinical relevant results that cannot be achieved by using cell lines or damaged cells. While there is one commercially available thermo-responsive product being used to reduce cell damages during harvesting, it is too expensive to be adopted widely. Our technology is low cost, scalable, reproducible, and serves large growing markets. Through this project, we will identify key markets for adoption, correctly define the key product attributes, and understand scaling requirements, hence providing a source of high-quality stem and primary cells for critical medical research and applications.

    This I-Corps project will validate market potentials of applying thermo-responsive supports for damage free and chemical free cell harvesting, which is crucial for cell based regenerative medicine and basic life science research. Our technology for generating thermo-responsive supports employs a cost-effective and simple process that involves only 3 steps: blending, casting and thermal annealing of a thermo-responsive polymer and a network forming silane. During annealing, the silane molecules anchor to the surface while simultaneously forming networks to entrap polymer chains. Other reported thermo-responsive surfaces generally are prepared by using non-easily accessible electron beam irradiation or plasma polymerization to deposit a thermo-responsive layer, or painstakingly grow the thermo-responsive polymer on a surface. Also, as compared to the commercial product, our technology allows enhanced cell attachment and growth, and accelerated cell detachment upon cooling, thus avoiding cell damage. Therefore, our technology, described in research papers and patent protected, provides better platforms for commercial expansion of stem and primary cells and for basic research. In addition, our technology, with small scale samples, has been validated by another research group for a variety of applications.

    the complementary properties of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) and nickel-titanium
    (NiTi) to create a unique composite material that has exceptional mechanical properties,
    and a high degree of tailorable behavior. Research into LCEs has proven they have
    excellent energy absorbing behavior and toughness, with performance exceeding
    that of most other rubber-like materials. However, typical polyurethane rubbers
    or silicones are inherently soft and/or have a slow recovery from large deformations;
    this limits its usefulness in many important situations. NiTi is the ideal material
    to compliment these shortcomings due to its own set of unique characteristics.
    Similar to metals, it is orders of magnitude stronger and stiffer than LCEs, but
    NiTi also undergoes shape-memory behavior that leads large recoverable deformation.
    Additionally, it also provides biasing stress to the LCEs that should greatly
    reduce the recovery time of the composite material. The combination of these unique
    and varied properties will give the composite material a level of customization
    and tailored behavior that is simply not achievable with any of the constituents
    independently and will be of interest from both a research perspective and attractive

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the development of an imaging system which addresses the current clinical need for a non-invasive imaging methodology that could image the skin over its depth with high resolutions while offering large histopathological contrasts between malignant and normal tissues. This will provide invaluable assistance to dermatologists with respect to improving tumor detection accuracies. The target market for this device would be the global dermatology diagnostic devices market which is expected to reach a value of USD 5.3 billion by the year 2025. Medical professionals who practice dermatology in clinics, established equipment manufacturers, and product distributors are the main stakeholders of this market. The proposed system will be ultimately integrated in a single framework, resulting in a compact (handheld) and real-time imaging device at very low manufacturing costs. By diagnosing tumors at an early stage, the proposed device will save tremendous amounts of time, effort, and patient discomfort and provide significant cost reductions for both the individual patient and the nation?s healthcare system.

    This I-Corps project investigates potential commercial markets for a new skin cancer imaging device developed based on the "Synthetic Ultra-Wideband Millimeter-wave Imaging" approach. In this approach, an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth in the millimeter-wave regime that cannot be realized by any conventional design method is assembled synthetically, resulting in significant improvements in the resolution of the acquired images. This approach is expected to enable the millimeter-wave imaging technology to be applied to skin imaging and skin cancer detection. The proposed technology has proven to be effective through proof-of-concept experiments. Firstly, statistically significant contrasts have been observed between the millimeter-wave dielectric properties of normal skin and two of the most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These results verify the potential of the proposed system to provide histopathological-contrast-based evaluations of skin lesions. Furthermore, the feasibility of employing the proposed imaging method for skin cancer detection has been confirmed using realistic skin-mimicking phantoms containing spherical tumor models. The final developed product will be a hand-held, point-of-care millimeter-wave imaging device which provides significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art technology.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project are two-fold.  First, by combining virtual assistants as facilitators, an integrated system of scaffolds through the Design Notebook, and support for collaborative interactions both within a learning environment as well as virtually, the platform has the potential to provide a self-contained, self-paced, stand-alone online platform focused on culturally- and socially-relevant game design that has the potential to expose and support hundreds of thousands of learners who do not currently have access to these types of opportunities, programs, or platforms within their communities in the United States.  Second, the platform has the potential to support global collaborations between groups of learners through its ability to showcase work and its virtual play-testing capabilities that will allow users to give and receive substantive feedback about the design of a game, and thus inform its iterative design, from anywhere.

    This I-Corps project proposes a unique online platform with supporting scaffolds, that supports learners through game design for social change virtually in similar ways as the SCAT (Supporting Computational Algorithmic Thinking) project supported African-American middle-school girls face-to-face (DRK-12 #1150098).  SCAT and its scaffolds have been shown to be effective not only at helping African-American middle-school girls engage in Computing by designing games for social change, but also in improving their perceptions of themselves as critical thinkers and game designers with an intent to pursue game design or some STEM-related field as a result.  As such, the core technology of the platform is a stand-alone online platform that scaffolds learners through designing and implementing games (video or mobile) for social change as well as develops their computational algorithmic thinking capabilities.  It will be designed to leverage the affordances of the scaffolding in the SCAT Learning Environment including the facilitator, Design Notebook, and other Scholars.  The platform will contain several key integrated sub-tools that model and coach learners as they think through their designs, make connections, make design decisions, collect feedback to inform the iterative design of their games, ask questions of themselves and their peers, reflect on their experiences, and showcase what they have created.

    related to the development of fluorescent materials. Commercial potential is expected
    to emerge when replacing costly existing technologies (like quantum dots) with
    inexpensive materials able that can be embodied as highly fluorescent organic
    solids. Such materials are expected to create new value and have commercial potential
    in several markets in which either aesthetics, brightness, or color transmission
    is critical for performance. Our primary markets of interest are colorants in
    paints and polymers. Fluorescent brighteners represent an important segment of
    the global dyes and pigments market (a >$30B per year industry). We believe our
    technology can expand this segment by streamlining the formulation and processing
    of fluorescent materials, and by broadening the available color palate. Immediate
    applications would arise in creation of new fluorescent paints and coatings for
    construction and safety applications, and may also provide new user-friendly color
    options to the growing market for 3D printing materials. We anticipate additional
    downstream applications to arise in customized biolabeling technologies and solar
    power generation. If successful, the broader impacts also include the training
    of scientists in the process of commercialization. \n\nThis I-Corps project provides
    a universal tool to address the outstanding intellectual challenge of understanding
    how to reverse loss of fluorescence from solid-state formulations of organic dyes.
    The intellectual merits will derive from new synthetic preparations of fluorescent
    dye and pigment technology by a method called small molecule isolation lattices,
    or SMILES. This project derives from research that has provided a way to insulate
    the color-carrying dye molecules from one another allowing their fluorescence
    to be rescued. A wide range of proof-of-principle experiments shows how to prepare
    the SMILES materials simply by mixing a proprietary compound with existing fluorescent
    compounds. The results show fluorescence in solids, as films, crystals, dyes,
    and particles under identical conditions that render conventional fluorescent
    dyes non-emissive.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is a lead enrichment kit that can allow fast detection of lead in water with low cost and low detection limit. Lead contamination in drinking water is a threat to human beings. Due to its health concern, the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) has set an action level of 15 µg/L for lead in tap water. Considering the great threat of lead to health even with low concentrations, it is necessary to have lead measurements in water at a regular basis. The proposed project aims to commercialize an inexpensive kit which would allow fast lead detection in water with low detection limit to meet Lead and Copper Rule (15 ppb). The kit provides two main benefits to customers: a lower cost ($4) than current kit ($11) for lead detection which meets Lead and Copper Rule and convenience for field sample measurements.

    This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the commercial adoption of our inexpensive lead enrichment kit for lead detection. Interviews will be conducted to help identify the potential customers and the market needs, evaluate the commercialization feasibility of the new technology, and optimize the technology to meet the demand of targeted customers. Inspired by findings from our current NSF-project, special enrichment kit was designed to accumulate Pb from water, allowing quick detection of lead in water with low concentrations using the inexpensive detection kit. Additionally, the proposed work will provide the basis for future development and commercialization of new enrichment kits to detect other aqueous contaminants in water with low detection limits.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the expansion of facial recognition technologies into the emissive infrared bands and the reduction of false negatives in the presence of large facial pose variation.  Visible 2-D image-based machine learning techniques dominate the commercial facial recognition landscape while heterogeneous facial recognition techniques including 3-D to 2-D matching and infrared to visible matching have not seen similar widespread commercial deployment.  The patented technology originates from an NSF Award and brings a crucial algorithmic component for commercial deployment that enhances heterogeneous facial recognition techniques while not relying on machine learning nor its concomitant large training database requirements.  This in turn opens up the potential for improved automated surveillance against a given watch-list deployable in a host of public and private spaces and under a wider range of surveillance conditions than currently possible using 2-D commercial matching algorithms.

    This I-Corps project is a result of technology developed under an NSF Award which enables a radical improvement in 3-D facial recognition by reducing the computational costs for facial implicit surface generation and biometric capture originating from multispectral (visible and infrared) sources.  The technology results in robust recognition in the presence of large facial pose variation and occlusion using 3-D facial implicit surfaces.  The improvement over existing 2-D commercial facial recognition algorithms is evident under conditions typical of automated surveillance where large facial pose variation and poor lighting result in false negatives using conventional practice.  The method and apparatus for 3-D facial recognition underlying this research, however, performs equally well under large facial pose variation and is able to seamlessly integrate multiple band infrared input along with visible image input for vastly lower false negative facial recognition even in the presence of low-light and nighttime conditions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a new service technology to improve physical activity engagement by developing personalized physical activity prescriptions with market-available exergames and fitness mobile applications (fitness app). This technology is a theory- and research-based service process that targets maintaining physical activity engagement. The application has the potential to improve fitness function in individuals at any age and in any physical condition when he/she engages in physical activity. The technology can have several broader impacts on society: (1) as a nation, we are in need of creative solutions to improve the general health and fitness of our citizens; (2) according to the US Census bureau, in 2050, the 65+ age population is predicted to be over 80 million (twice that in 2012) who need to be fit; and (3) chronic illnesses result in significant reduction in productivity of the working population - the severity of illness can be reduced by improving the fitness of the individual.

    This I-Corps project aims (1) to determine what the customer segments and value propositions are for the technology; (2) to identify in what format the application should be delivered to make a market/product fit; and (3) to establish the readiness to transit the technology as an automated marketable service product. As of today, the technology exists as a manually prescribing procedure for patients who suffer from fatigue symptom. It has been thoroughly validated by pilot tests. Personalization features gauge and match multi-level factors, so the likelihood of adherence to the physical activity prescription is very high. The Exergame Grading Scheme is used to rate intensity of fitness attributes and energy expenditure of exergames and fitness app. The personalized physical activity prescriptions are generated by the Exergame Grading Scheme based algorithm, so that the prescription can challenge the individual's functional capacity. The intellectual merit lies in: (1) identifying the right combination of hardware/software technologies that can accurately implement the product; and (2) implementing a solution that is scalable in mass volumes with low cost per unit.

    safer and more reliable 3D printed metal structures, also commercially known as
    additive manufactured parts.  The project will explore the needs of the 3D printing
    industry as the technology is applied to ever more demanding areas such as aerospace
    and automotive.  In aerospace, each component must be produced by a verified and
    validated procedure, and in-situ inspection can meet that need.  In the automotive
    industry, representative components must be evaluated to verify production procedures
    and equipment operation; again, in-situ inspection can meet this need.   In addition
    to aerospace and automotive, 3D printed metal structures are expected to have
    wide commercial applications, ranging from health to defense.  In these applications,
    safety and reliability are paramount.  For example, a 3D printed replacement for
    a broken bone must be highly resistant to breakage itself.  However, the mass
    limitations for a bone replacement require efficiency in design and a trust in
    fabrication.  \n\nThis I-Corps project is a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method
    that is used to observe the metal structure while it is being printed or upon
    completion of the manufacturing process.  Historically, metal parts must be subjected
    to destructive inspection methods to meet high reliability requirements after
    manufacturing.  This alternative NDE is based on a novel X-ray imaging method,
    grating-based interferometry, first introduced about ten years ago.  In this method,
    micro-fabricated X-ray optics are used to enhance the X-ray image, especially
    for the detection of sub-micron features.  The traditional X-ray image is improved
    with an overlay image that reveals the presence of sub-micron features.  Recently,
    sub-micron features in 3D printed metal components have been correlated with preliminary
    crack formation under fatigue stress.  Therefore, an X-ray grating-based interferometry
    image of a freshly printed structure (either in-progress or completed) can reveal
    the presence of failure points.  By demonstrating the viability of this unique
    NDE methodology to potential users of 3D printed parts, it is anticipated that
    new market segments can gain sufficient confidence in part reliability to incorporate
    these 3D printed parts into critical components.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

    of overweight trucks could significantly decrease the tens of billions of dollars

    at weigh stations.  The technology measures the deformation of structures under
    dynamic loads with a passive camera system that can monitor the structure from
    a distance. The system uses off-the-shelf commercially available video cameras
    to monitor a specific target on a structure, such as a fastener, reflector, or

    transportation vehicles, airplanes, drones, underwater vessels, wind turbines,
    and HVAC fans all experience the adverse effects of drag in terms of increased

    energy production. Potential efficiency gains using the proposed technology can
    save numerous industries significant energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    and solve a multitude of problems associated with aerodynamic/hydrodynamic inefficiencies.
    For example, a 5% increase in efficiency due to drag reduction translates to $5
    billion in fuel savings for the trucking industry and the equivalent energy production
    of an additional 2000 wind turbines per year for the wind energy industry. Micro-textured
    surfaces for passive flow control presents a unique opportunity in enhancing efficiency
    in that it can be designed for optimal performance depending on the application

    a micro-structured coating inspired by shark-skin, which passively modifies the
    flow close to the surface of an object resulting in drag reduction both in air
    and water applications. Experimental results performed using the section of a

    a cylinder, respectively. Additionally, enhancements of up to 45% in lift generated
    by an airfoil was measured when the micro-structured coating was applied to the

According to statista.com, the number of smartphone users in the world will be more than five billion by 2019. The popularity of these mobile devices is due to a unique set of features including ubiquitous Internet access through communication technologies such as Wifi and 4G/LTE, easy to use touch-based inputs, and numerous applications and games. In the meantime, the security of mobile devices is becoming a major concern as device users are storing sensitive data such as personal contacts and utilizing sensitive applications like banking and stock trading. Strong authentication as the forefront defense mechanism can prevent unauthorized access to a mobile device that may lead to lack of accountability, data loss or stealing, and identity theft. Due to the popularity of mobile devices and their uses in government, business, and even military applications, securing mobile devices with secure, memorable, and usable authentication is of great societal importance.

    This I-Corps project focuses on exploring the market potential for multi-dimensional authentication schemes. The new paradigm of multi-dimensional authentication schemes can achieve better memorability, security, and usability at the same time. The new schemes fuse information from multiple dimensions to form a password, allowing the schemes to enlarge the password space and improve memorability by reducing memory interference. The information fusion can increase usability as fewer input gestures are required for passwords of the same security strength. The schemes can also be shoulder-surfing resistant. A successful authentication requires a user to respond to a random challenge so that a set of predefined rules are satisfied after adjustments made by the user. The schemes can also be used for continuously monitoring device user behavior to ensure the current device users is a user authorized to use the device. Through this project, we will be able to investigate the needs from various customer segments and polish our technologies and prototypes to meet the needs.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    based on the characteristics of the Augmented Reality WEarable Device (ARWED)
    for training of post-stroke patients, allowing, for example, the user to perceive
    an impaired arm as healthy. Preliminary training protocols, incorporated within
    the ARWED, make the system a reliable solution that is expected to be broadly
    utilized by medical professionals working in rehabilitation, sports therapy ,and
    convalescence. Although the ARWED has been developed mainly for the physical training
    of post-stroke patients, the project's explorations are expected to provide effective
    tools for the physical rehabilitation of patients with limb limitations at any
    scale -- ranging from individuals suffering partial loss of motor ability to those
    with severe limitations in mobility due to strokes, birth defects or accidents.
    Since observational learning may offer greater benefits regarding transfer to
    Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), in comparison to robotic-based stroke training,
    the medical community would also benefit from the development of the ARWED. Insights
    into how training using technology may enhance the recovery of motor control in
    diverse populations while providing a novel intervention that may prove more effective
    than what is currently available. \n\nThis I-Corps project centers on exploiting
    the link between action-observation and action execution in order to develop training
    protocols, based on observational learning techniques, to facilitate rehabilitation
    following a neurological disorder. Such a disorder may range from such catastrophic
    events as stroke or a spinal cord injury. Currently, there are limited systems
    that utilize virtual reality in the relearning of biological movements. The development
    of the ARWED required solving several challenges in computer vision, modeling,
    and robot motion. The current testing of the effectiveness of the device requires
    combined expertise from the areas of biomechanics, signal analysis, virtual reality,
    robotic fault recovery theory and rehabilitation. Therefore, the theoretical contributions
    emerging from this collaborative research is expected to advance knowledge and
    understanding not only within the medical field, but also across the above-mentioned
    research areas. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will lead to the
    education of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of Engineering,
    Medicine and Kinesiology, among others. The outcomes of the project will facilitate
    a dialogue between Physical/Occupational Therapy and Engineering students and
    professionals that can aid in the human recovery following neurological disorders
    efforts.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop aerogel-based catalysts as a sustainable, environmentally friendly material for pollution mitigation applications. These materials could reduce or even eliminate the use of expensive precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium that are currently used in automotive exhaust after-treatment systems. Thus, aerogel catalysts could have a significant positive economic and environmental impact on this nation.  Commercialization of these novel materials will extend the design space available to pollution-control system engineers, and hence open new, potentially transformative, avenues for meeting current and future pollution regulations. In addition, this project will enable undergraduate students to develop entrepreneurial ideas and learn what is involved in bringing technology developed through fundamental research to the marketplace.

    This I-Corps project will explore commercial opportunities for catalytic aerogels. Aerogels are materials with remarkable properties, including unusually high surface area, low density, low thermal conductivity and a nanoporous structure that is stable at high temperatures. Aerogels can be fabricated using a rapid supercritical extraction method and tailored to contain different catalytic metal species such as copper, cobalt, vanadia and alumina. Research in this area is focused on developing methods for making different types of catalytic aerogels and on testing their effectiveness in pollution mitigation applications. Catalytic testing of copper-alumina aerogels under simulated automotive exhaust conditions has demonstrated that they are capable of converting unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide into less harmful gases.

    to improve the literacy of blind people by enabling improved access to digital
    content. Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks
    to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense
    of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single
    line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations,
    diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and
    math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due
    to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively
    expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An affordable full-page
    tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics would
    significantly improve blind people's access to digital technology. New technology
    can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind
    people. \n\nThe I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using
    a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display.
    Based on the technology, a microfluidic chip can reduce the complexity and cost
    of controlling a large number of densely-packed pneumatic actuators. A large array
    of thousands of individually controllable features is possible. The pneumatic
    actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale
    integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation
    ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force
    outputs. These are all essential features for building dense-array tactile displays,
    particularly ones that are low-cost and suitable for rendering braille and tactile

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will directly affect the treatment and management of the over 80 km3 of wastewater and solid wastes produced each year in the US. Waste treatment processes are directly tied to environmental and human health in both developed and developing countries but are subject to high costs due to significant energy and maintenance requirements. Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure. Potential markets for this technology include public, municipal facilities in addition to treatment facilities in the industrial/agricultural sector.  Development of the proposed technology will likely spur additional applications of AI systems in other fields centered around microbial community based engineered systems like bioproduct production, biosensing, and bioremediation.

    This I-Corps project is based on our recent development of a machine learning based approach used to accurately predict microbial community structure, process stability, and reactor performance for wastewater treatment. This novel approach, which incorporates genomic data along with environmental and operational parameters into data-mining datasets has demonstrated significant increases in accurately predicting process stability and performance of small-scale wastewater systems compared to models developed without consideration of microbial community dynamics. The predictive models developed through the construction of artificial neural networks have potential to inform engineering decisions for optimized performance and stability of environmental biotechnologies in full-scale systems. Development and implementation of this approach will not only progress the understanding and control of microbial communities that inhabit environmental biotechnologies but may be expanded to other microbiomes such as those associated with human health and biogeochemical cycles.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in providing a design-driven robotics framework encompassing a low-cost, modular robot hardware kit, a software app for motion design, and a web-based Computer-Aided Design (CAD) environment to enable students, makers, hobbyists, and industry practitioners to innovate and invent robots and machines. The framework brings together computational thinking, design process, and programming to meet STEM imperatives and provide compelling value propositions for both the education and prototyping industry. The proposed robotics framework has the potential to fill 2.5 million unfilled jobs in STEM and positively impact the U.S. educational robotics market, which is expected to grow to $2.7 billion by 2021.

    This I-Corps project leverages the latest research in mechanism synthesis area to create novel algorithms for designing motions of planar linkage mechanisms. Planar linkage mechanisms are rigid bodies connected to one another using rotating or sliding joints and their special configurations give rise to desired motion. Their implementation in a mobile app provides users an ability to synthesize and simulate mechanisms for robots and machines. While, the robot hardware kit employs inexpensively produced novel planar and compliant pieces to create a new method of interconnection to realize three-dimensional geometry and mechanisms of robots and structures, the web-based CAD tool would allow users to design customized robot parts. The flexibility of the design allows for the use of any programming platform and any readily available sensors and actuators thereby dramatically broadening the inventions design capabilities.

    rural or suburban areas with limited medical services, 4) senior living and retirement
    communities, 5) health insurance companies, and 6) ophthalmic instrument manufacturers.
    Eye diseases are usually detected in clinics with ophthalmic devices, e.g. optical
    coherence tomography, corneal topography and slit lamp, which are large, expensive
    and not portable, and need to be operated by trained technicians. However, our
    proposed smartphone-based eye disease detection method is small, affordable, portable,
    and it can be operated by patients in a convenient way, which will overcome the
    limitations mentioned above. The proposed algorithm can detect eye diseases or
    monitor eye healthiness in a proper and timely manner, and it can share the monitoring
    information with ophthalmologists. Hence, eye diseases can be detected in the
    earlier stage with our technology.  Moreover, ophthalmologist can focus more on
    severe treatments or surgeries. A 5- to 10-fold lower cost is an added potential
    benefit. \n\nThis I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a new
    eye disease detection technology using a smartphone and make it broadly available
    for scientific discovery and medical applications. The project further develops
    a smartphone-based eye disease detection technology that is more accurate and
    convenient using image processing and machine learning techniques. The proposed
    smartphone-based eye disease detection technology makes use of panoramic images
    or short video recordings of the eye at different angles. The recorded eye images
    are divided into iris, lens, sclera, and cornea components using automatic image
    cropping techniques. Each divided component is then analyzed using shape detection
    and color matching techniques to recognize the shape and to detect the abnormality
    of each component, respectively. Preliminary finding shows that the proposed technology
    detects keratoconus with more than 90% accuracy from 30 subjects. To detect diverse
    types of eye diseases and to increase the accuracy of eye disease detection, we
    will collect additional eye data from patients and normal subjects to form a larger
    database, and apply machine learning techniques to the accumulated database. Bringing
    these innovative capabilities to the commercial market will significantly improve

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to decrease health care costs for sleep apnea monitoring and diagnosis. It is estimated that a large proportion of potential sleed apnea patients are undiagnosed. Sleep apnea is a potentially remedial risk factor for hypertension, type II diabetes, stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Sleep apnea also causes learning disability among children. The proposed sleep apnea screening tool is accurate and easy to use. It can potentially be broadly employed in clinics and homes, and reduce the need for both overnight laboratory-based polysomnograms and home sleep studies.

    This I-Corps project targets to provide an easy-to-use screening tool for sleep apnea that combines mobile technology, internet of things (IoT) technology, and machine learning technology into one system.  The core technology of this screening tool is the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with IoT sensors. The solution is expected to deliver a high accuracy and sensitivity sleep apnea screening methodology using deep learning methods. Preliminary results are consistent with six types of apnea-hypopnea index threshold.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to translate quantum communication technological breakthroughs into real-life applications. This goal will bring significant social and economic impacts as quantum communication has the potential to revolutionize the global telecommunication industry. Commercially, this vision provides countless opportunities to interact with a broad spectrum of entities such as telecom companies, financial firms, defense agencies and banking corporations. It is predicted that advanced quantum technologies driven by quantum information processing will revolutionize traditional communication methods by enabling the ultimate security for the transmission of cryptography keys, based on the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics which facilitate detecting any eavesdropping attempt on the encoded key.

    This I-Corps project is devoted to developing portable modular hardware necessary to build a protected cryptographic network immune to known attacks.  This technology is designed to overcome the main challenge of operation over extended distances of thousands of kilometers, as required to establish secure communication networks between cities and countries. The team has successfully designed and built commercialization-friendly quantum devices including quantum light sources, characterization units, and quantum memories aimed to store and transform quantum information in a manner needed for secure communication. These devices are room temperature operational and do not require cumbersome and expensive infrastructure, thus being ready for outside of the laboratory operation. This quantum toolbox is currently being used in different international locations as a test-bed of important capabilities, such as entanglement distribution, ultrafast operations, and satellite communication compatibility.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide enhanced capabilities for improved management of forest resources via aerial reforestation. Sustainable forest management practices are important to decrease soil erosion, increase biodiversity, sequester carbon and meet future demand for timber and biomass supply to the pulp, paper, wood, and energy sectors. Reforestation (natural or assisted) of cleared or degraded land is an important management objective to achieve these goals. Management costs of private forest lands have increased over time particularly for small-scale private landowners. Unmanned aerial vehicles, equipped with customized hardware and software, have the ability to replace or supplement conventional assisted-reforestation practices (hand planting or mechanical) and provide a cost-effective alternative. This project's approach to reforestation can increase accessibility to physically remote or topographically constrained locations that are difficult to access with large heavy machinery and vehicles.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a data driven management system for assisted reforestation efforts. The system is designed to plant seeds using unmanned aerial vehicles outfitted with customized hardware. The system hardware is capable of projecting customize seed pellets into a range of soil conditions and at penetration depths necessary for successful germination. Coupled to the system is a machine learning algorithm that provides data metrics on forest land holdings using remotely sensed images. The machine learning algorithm can be trained, based on data type and quantity, for more accurate and reliable analysis. These data enable private landowners to assess overall conditions of their holdings, facilitate development of reforestation plans, and determine flight patterns. In addition, the algortihm is capable of communicating and guiding the unmanned aerial vehicle's autonomous guidance system to direct field planting.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will result in higher performing polymeric photonic materials (plastics which interact with light) which will have extensive application in consumer devices such as computers, cell phones, lighting units, telecommunications, cameras, and sensors.  Polymeric photonic materials are finding evermore application in devices due to their low weight, high-impact resistance, and ability to be fabricated into unique shapes/architectures, however, have paltry optical performance when compared to their heavier, costlier glass counterparts.  The material developed here combines the existing positive attributes of polymeric optical materials while offering significantly higher performance without large increases in price.

    This I-Corps project will develop high optical quality crosslinked polymer networks with the unique ability to be remolded, reshaped, and repurposed when placed under the correct conditions without loss of mechanical integrity or optical properties.  Polymeric optical components (lenses, waveguides, etc.) are desirable over fragile and heavy glass counterparts, however, defects and birefringence (stresses which negatively interact with light) prevent polymers from being used for applications requiring high optical quality materials.  This proprietary technology allows for microscopic scrambling of chemical bonds to occur in the polymeric materials only when it is placed under certain conditions, effectively annealing out the aforementioned defects and birefringence in the polymer, giving high optical quality materials.  Current research is focused on taking this dynamic platform and placing it into commercially relevant resins that fabricate tough, robust, optically clear, high performance materials.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is providing a possible paradigm shift in antimicrobial therapy and in treating antibiotic resistant bacteria in a multitude of fields including healthcare, agriculture, water treatment, and veterinary. The ability to directly target drug resistant strains of various microbes can provide a vital impact on the state of global medicine. The CDC estimates more than 2 million people become infected with antibiotics resistant bacteria yearly, with at least 23,000 deaths due to antibiotic resistant infections. The use and availability of a natural nanomaterial that can innately affect the growth of various strains of microbes will enable wider access to antimicrobial applications.  Aside from this potential for direct use, nano-antibiotics can also possibly be used to treat water systems, enabling a broad new market application.

    This I-Corps project stems from the core technology which enables selective targeting of infections inside human patients while denying the bacteria access to the traditional mechanisms through which drug resistance develops. The aim is to address the need for modern solutions to drug-resistant infections with engineered nano-antibiotics that are capable of reversing drug resistance in bacteria. These nano-antibiotics combine the genetic specificity of nucleic acids with a physically-active vector with therapeutic capability. A stimuli-responsive function is added to allow the nanoparticle to be tunable to specific infections as needed, while maintaining a wide-spectrum usability. This therapeutic strategy is unique not just because gene silencing is used to remove drug resistant properties from multi-drug resistant bacteria, a delivery vector that has the capability to kill the microbe is also used. This approach is generalizable, and can potentially be implemented to treat any bacterial infection that has become resistant to conventional antibiotics.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of improved magnetic nanoparticles with safer profiles for biomedical applications. One specific market would be contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Current gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) cannot be administered to patients with poor renal function, and more recent clinical studies indicated long-term residual gadolinium deposition in the brains of healthy patients. As gadolinium is the source of safety concerns for current GBCAs, one possible solution is to replace gadolinium with bio-compatible iron-oxides that offer similar contrast enhancement. Conventional iron-based MRI contrast agents have a broad particle size distribution which results in undesired side effects and performance variability. The technology developed here enables tight control of particle size distribution and physicochemical properties, which improves the agent's performance and safety profile. Moreover, an iron-based contrast agent can be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of peripheral vascular diseases.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that enables the explicit control of the physicochemical properties of iron-oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles offer potential as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) contrast agents that overcome the safety limitations of currently used alternatives. Iron-oxide nanoparticles have been previously approved for clinical use as MRI contrast agents but were discontinued from the market due to variable performance and safety concerns - primarily due to formulations with a broad size distribution. The technology developed here enables the production of iron-oxide nanoparticles with highly controlled physiochemical properties and low batch-to-batch variability which yield reproducible MRI results. This homogenous formulation is expected to have more controlled pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profiles compared to conventional iron-based agents.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in its capability to promote the safety of people with dementia. According to research, 70% of people with dementia will wander, which can result in a difficult experience for both missing people and care givers. The demand for protecting and recovering missing people with dementia has been increased over the past decades. Advancement of this tracking system has the potential for enhancing their safety and giving a peace of mind to care givers without compromising the effectiveness. The core set of methods and processes of the technology has the potential to be replicated, adapted and used in other crowd sensing applications globally.  Even before the care givers notice, the "crowd" can potentially be able to help.

    This I-Corps project is focused on technology to improve the tracking, and protecting paradigm of using mobile devices carried by the people with dementia as well as will also explore the commercial potential of an intelligent tracking system. This innovative system, LED-based Smart Cue (LESQ), can monitor the status of the wearer in addition to tracking the location. If an abnormal condition is detected, the LESQ system can ask for immediate help. If the wearer carries a smartphone, the LESQ system can send an alert message directly to the care giver. One important feature of the LESQ system is to improve the self-diagnosis of the potential for wandering by the people with dementia. A smart tag tracks the wearer's status by using the timer and gaits, in addition to the geo-location. Implementation of the cost and power efficient, lightweight, and flexible system may significantly improve the usability.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that the project device has the potential to become the next generation of ultra-low power devices. Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFETs), especially those with type III-V heterostructures, are excellent candidates to overcome both size and power scaling issue of Silicon metal?oxide?semiconductor field-effect transistor (Si MOSFET). III-V heterojunction TFET can easily achieve low power consumption by having high on-current and low off-current within a very short range of applied voltage. One of the bottlenecks for III-V materials to become mainstream is the lack of integration with current silicon manufacturing technology. The proposed device demonstrates technology that is compatible with silicon manufacturing technology which has the most commercial impact compared to any other III-V materials devices as it does not require any changes in the existing manufacturing process. By realizing this device, it will open the opportunity to replace the current existing FinFET technology in cellphone and computers, making a new generation of portable devices for logic applications and enabling ever-connected internet of things applications.

    This I-Corps project proposes to create a low power tunneling field effect transistor (TFET) on a silicon substrate using novel fabrication techniques. The device employs InAs/AlSb/GaSb junction as the tunneling junction. This unique junction produces effective modulation of electron tunneling under control of the applied gate bias. The tunneling barrier AlSb layer is sandwiched between InAs and GaSb. This configuration allows the free band movements between InAs and GaSb. This unique junction is combined with a fin type channel structure to allow effective control over the active channel region by the surrounding gate metals. The fin device architecture will allow excellent gate electro-static control, and combining it with the tunneling mechanism will enable the fabricated devices to achieve a subthreshold slope much smaller than 60mV/dec. Another unique aspect of the proposed design is the use of elevated asymmetric T-shaped source and drain.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve predictivity in preclinical pharmaceutical research and development to lower drug development costs and to improve drug approval rates. Recent cost estimates for developing a prescription drug is $2.6 billion over the 10-year development period, and the annual drug approval rate is as low as 20-30 drugs, while hundreds of drugs candidates fail each year. The failure rates of a large percentage of drug candidates at the clinical trial increase the overall costs of approved drugs. Replacing simplistic 2D cell culture models and animal models with human organ-on-a-chip (OoC) technologies will provide human-specific solutions for drug development. These tests can provide stronger predictions and confidence to advance the right drug candidates to clinical trials and also identify problem candidates early to save time and money associated with progressing the wrong compounds through expensive clinical trials.

    This I-Corps project provides an integrative solution to the pharmaceutical industry for preclinical drug testing using Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) technologies with companion computational tools. OoC technologies, which are micro-engineered systems combining living 3D human cells, fluidic channels, and biomaterials, emulate biological and physiological processes of the real organ in vitro. The need for more physiologically relevant in vitro systems for preclinical efficacy and toxicity testing has led to a major effort to develop OoC technologies. OoC approaches have been recognized as emerging technologies with potential to revolutionize medical research and drug discovery. However, OoC technologies require specialized operational infrastructure including instrumentation and an experienced tissue engineering team not common in industry. By providing a specialized service model, the benefits of human-relevant OoCs become accessible by bridging the gap between pharmaceutical companies, OoC companies, and academia.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is expected to primarily address the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, but is also relevant to a broader range of biological applications. The cost of pharmaceutical drug discovery has increased by nearly 150% in the past 10 years, averaging about $2.6 billion to develop just one drug. A major contributing factor is the inefficacy of pre-clinical studies that still typically use simple 2D cell cultures as experimental models which do not accurately recapitulate the complexity of 3D, multicellular physiological environments. The development of a modular multi-printhead bioprinter will enable a wide variety of materials to be incorporated into the 3D printed tissues. As a result, researchers in pharmaceutical companies will receive a cost-effective means to streamline drug development, leading to increased productivity in bringing medications to market.

    This I-Corps project aims to investigate the commercialization potential of a modular, multi-printhead bioprinter. This bioprinting system solves the current limitations with two key features. Firstly the multiple dispensing mechanisms can collectively process a wide range of materials. Several printheads each specialized in different materials and printing styles allow 3D, 2D, extrusion, or droplet printing of cell-laden fluids of all viscosities with minimal stress and high resolutions. Secondly, this is a modular design that allows the customization of a bioprinter to a customer's specifications. The system supports the construction and operation of bioprinters with any combination of the different printheads to match the customer's price point and research needs. The combination of these features enables the customer to create complex biological tissues of their design.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is that it offer to standardize vaccines across a broad range of pathogens in an economical way.  Typically, depending on the type of pathogen, different vaccine development and manufacturing processes must be employed, resulting in costly technological fragmentation.  Having a single technology that is applicable to all pathogens is ideal, as it economically streamlines the development and manufacturing process.  The ability to rapidly produce vaccines on-demand and at scale is also important.  Conventional vaccine design and manufacturing methods take years to develop and months to produce using cells or eggs.  Vaccines that can instead be produced by chemically-defined organic and enzymatic reactions in the absence of any living systems is preferred as it avoids cross-contamination. Moreover, if the components can self-assemble into vaccines upon mixing, the energy requirements and costs are dramatically reduced.  With such a technology, new vaccines can be efficiently manufactured quickly to meet patient demand.

    This I-Corps project further develops a platform for a replicon payload inside the nanoparticle vaccine.  The replicon, a large mRNA, possesses the safety and flexibility of conventional mRNA, but is capable of finite self-replication. Antigens specific to a particular disease are encoded into the mRNA replicon.  Thus, once injected, the replicon can temporarily turn a patient's cells into a vaccine production factory.  A second merit is the delivery system innovation that enables the therapeutic deployment of replicons as a vaccination tool: the dendrimer nanomaterial.  Purpose-built for replicons, it is a fully synthetic, chemically-defined system that solves the decades-long challenge of safely delivering replicons intact into the cytoplasm of a patient's cells upon injection.  The vaccine nanoparticle efficiently activates the cellular and humoral branches of adaptive immunity without booster injections.  A third merit is the ability to perform simultaneous vaccinations.  Because of the delivery system's large payload capacity, a variety of different and unique replicons can be co-formulated to immunize patients against multiple diseases at once.  A fourth merit is that these vaccines do not require adjuvants, thus improving both tolerability and safety.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to develop algorithmic methods and computational systems that will provide new information, cheaply, quickly, consistently, and at a large scale, to inform investments in building, energy, and green infrastructure for engineering consultancies, construction companies, power utilities, real-estate developers, and cities. Currently, studies for built, energy, and green infrastructure investments are typically made case-by-case and employ infrequent, manual, and expensive audits performed by trained professionals. In addition, the ground-truth data (site surveys and other urban asset databases) used to inform these decisions are siloed across stakeholders and are often expensive and difficult to collect. The ecosystem of simulation and analysis tools is fragmented into a variety of highly complex software packages that require considerable effort and customization. This results in much repeated effort, inconsistent results across different projects, and high costs for surveys and instrumentation.

    This I-Corps project will investigate commercial applications of a machine learning system that ingests, aggregates, processes and learns mappings between, remote-sensing, model simulation, and local sensor and survey data on buildings and their environment. The data used will be best-available open source and commercial satellite data, as well as Internet of Things data from buildings and energy infrastructure. The project further develops neural-network based generative machine learning models that can emulate complex physical and engineering systems but are much cheaper and faster to deploy and maintain in practice. This system would allow users to make inferences (physical parameter recovery, forecasts) about built, green, and energy infrastructure and their surroundings (micro-climates) where this data is not available, in a low-cost, large-scale, automated way, removing the need for certain expensive sensor deployments or manual surveys. The system develops a top-down, machine-learning based simulation capability that would allow to perform fast scenario and impact analysis of investments and interventions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable a new portable power source with unprecedented energy density, which could have transformative effects on military and commercial portable/autonomous systems. For example, a portable power generator for soldiers using the proposed technology would result in a 50-75% weight reduction on a 72-hour mission, meaning soldiers could bring more water and ammo or reduce chance of injury due to weight. The proposed technology could also extend the operation of drones and other unmanned vehicles on land, air, and water. Currently these applications are almost exclusively powered by batteries, despite hydrocarbon fuel being 60 times more energy dense. The proposed technology could also be used in a number of commercial applications from emergency response and disaster relief, remote sensing, and energy access in emerging markets.

    This I-Corps project is a new approach to thermophotovoltaics, using a photonic crystal selective emitter, that enables practical fuel to electricity conversion in the 1-100 W range.  The technology works by converting fuel to electricity using heat and light as intermediaries. Specifically, hydrocarbon combustion heats a photonic crystal emitter to incandescence, leading to thermal radiation which drives specialized photovoltaic cells to generate electricity. Currently, there is no effective power source for applications requiring 1-100 Watts of electricity for extended duration, a space where demand is burgeoning. This technology would enable ultraportable, reliable, and silent energy generation, particularly for applications that do not have access to conventional power sources.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be a reduction in food losses and waste.  Roughly one third of the food produced in the world gets lost or wasted.  A large portion of this waste is due to proper cold-chain infrastructure from farms to consumers.  Transport refrigeration is an expensive option that consumes large amounts of diesel fuel.  The transport industry can see significant cost savings by converting to energy-efficient refrigeration units that utilize waste heat rather than using dedicated diesel engines.  This could make refrigeration more accessible to farmers, retailers and food processors everywhere.  The project is has the potential significantly reduce food waste worldwide.

     This I-Corps project will explore the commercialization potential of a new material that can absorb up to 82% water by weight, nearly twice the amount of the previous best material.  This highly absorbent material also demonstrates a record cooling capacity per given volume.  These capabilities open up a new class of applications in transport refrigeration where equipment weight and size need to be minimized.  An adsorption refrigeration cycle operating with this material can efficiently harvest waste heat from a truck's engine to produce two times the cooling power of a conventional vapor compressor system without using additional diesel fuel.

    The broader/commercial impact of this I-Corps project is to potentially reduce significantly the number of deaths of premature babies in low to middle income countries. Premature birth is globally the number one cause of death in children under the age of 5, with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) being the leading cause of these deaths. RDS is usually addressed by using a bCPAP (bubble continuous positive airway pressure) machine that provides the baby with a humidified blend of air and oxygen at a controlled temperature and pressure. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art, low-cost bCPAP machine that aids preterm babies in low to middle income countries. While bCPAP devices are standard in wealthy nations, their $8-10k cost often makes them unaffordable for countries with fewer resources.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of a novel bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) machine.  Some of the innovative features of this device include a cassette format for ease of maintenance and repair, a battery backup for uninterrupted care, robust component selection for extended lifetime use and a drug delivery add on for potential treatment of comorbidities. If successfully implemented, this product would potentially help provide quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations and reduce premature deaths due to respiratory distress syndrome.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to fill a critical need in neuro-radiology, neuro-oncology, and radiation therapy, by developing a clinic-ready software suite that computes physician-approved volumes of key three-dimensional (3D) structures in the brain from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Currently, physicians make a decision on tumor status by visual inspection and by measuring the largest perpendicular diameters from a single two-dimensional (2D) axial image. Radiation oncologists use manual segmentation to delineate the boundaries of the tumor regions; these contours are used for treatment planning. Current practice is associated with significant limitations that impede the quality of patient care. This software suite will potentially change the status-quo by generating 3D volumetric structures of tumors and other key regions in the brain. The physician can readily apply this information to better understand the disease and optimize care leading to early treatment, less morbidity, and longer survival times.

    This I-Corps project produces a practical, clinic-ready suite of Magnetic Resonance (MR) analyses and display tools to solve the number one impediment to reliable use of MRIs for guiding radiation treatment of brain cancer: accurate and timely multimodal 3D segmentation of key structures in the brain. The main engine of the MR suite is a mathematical optimization framework that combines calculus of variation with deep learning techniques; thus amenable to pixel-level-accurate 3D segmentation in almost real-time. The proposed technology was developed from an algorithm for multimodal brain segmentation, which consists of (a) an automated, accurate and robust algorithm for 3D image segmentation, combined with (b) semi-automated and interactive multimodal labeling that requires physician approval.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps will be to enable faster development of protein-based therapeutic drugs, such as antibodies and biosimilars. The core technology allows for faster determination of structural features of such protein therapeutic agents, which is important because structure is essential to both the function and efficiency of a protein therapeutic. The technology can be applied at many points within a therapeutic's development, from the initial discovery and screening phases to testing a developed therapeutic's stability under a wide array of conditions and environments for quality control purposes. Given the significant fraction of protein therapeutics, specifically, within the rapidly growing biopharmaceutical market, we believe our technology will both be of significant value to this industry and enable faster development of therapeutics for treating diseases in the future.

    This I-Corps project further develops a technology that determines structural features of proteins in a liquid environment.  This is significant not only because a protein's structure dictates its function and by learning about the structure much information is gained about the protein itself, but also because proteins natively exist within cells in liquid environments. A plasma is used to create a reactive molecule from water surrounding the protein, and by measuring the areas on the protein that get labeled with this molecule, one can visualize relevant regions of the protein. When another element is added that changes the structure of the protein, or binds to and masks one side/face of the protein, this is reflected is changing levels or areas of modification by the reactive molecule. In this way, the technique can quickly map protein structural changes.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is more efficient heat transfer in a variety of potential industrial and consumer electronics applications.  More efficient heat transfer translates into greater computational speed and output.  In a world where electronics are growing more powerful and are ever increasing in capacity, the ability to remove heat is a significant consideration.  This platform technology has the potential to be integrated as a high performance thermal grease. One possible application is as a computer CPU grease (or heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste, thermal compound, thermal gel, thermal interface material, or thermal paste).  Similar products are commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources.

    This I-Corps project further develops a class of novel greases that incorporate nanoparticles to enhance their performance. Thesee are stable and homogeneous greases based on carbon nanotubes in polyalphaolefin oil.  Inter molecular Van der Waals forces and three dimensional percolation networks in the grease structure are determined to be the stability of the grease. The work builds on a recent discovery of a way to significantly enhance the electrical and thermal conductivity of the grease by including these additional additives in small amounts.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to produce lightweight aggregates (LWA) from unused waste bottom ash of coal electric power industry that can be used for concrete and geotechnical applications. Each year in the United States around 120 million tons of coal combustion products (e.g., fly ash and bottom ash) are generated of which 37% is reused. This has led to a large historical stock of unused coal ash stored in on-site surface impoundments.  Production of LWA from unused bottom ash will result in conversion of waste material to value-added product that can attract concrete and geotechnical markets. The produced LWA can be used as an aggregate in (a) structural lightweight concrete production, (b) internal curing of concrete, (c) production of concrete masonry blocks for buildings, retaining walls and landscape, (d) production of thermal/sound insulating concrete units, and (e) lightweight fill for highways, bridge abutments, retaining walls, and foundations.

    This I-Corps project will lead to significant understanding of market size and commercial potential of lightweight aggregates (LWA) produced from waste bottom ash. Bottom ash has high residual carbon and the innovative sintering technology is to use this residual carbon with appropriate fluxing agent to create a porous material encapsulated by a glassy layer that exhibits pozzolanic reactivity. This novel material will possess an active amorphous surface and an inert crystalline porous interior in a controlled ratio. The technology uses a thermodynamic model and can target a wide range of bottom coal ashes with various physical conditions and chemical compositions.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to accelerate and control gene delivery, and to allow researchers to find novel solutions to challenging diseases.  Gene delivery, also known as transfection, is a promising approach to treat diseases such as cancer and, thus, could provide a profound benefit to society.  Using gene therapy and immune-therapy, gene delivery allows for the efficient introduction of a new gene into cells. The specific technology employed offers a photo-responsive, nanoparticle-based technique with the advantages of higher efficacy, controlled gene-release, and faster transfection rates.  This has the potential to dramatically decrease the time required for transfection, as well as greatly reducing the required amount of gene and/or drug.  Thus, along with providing researchers the unique ability to control the process through a simple light trigger, this technology could provide substantial commercial impact.

    This I-Corps project is a gene delivery tool that utilizes two biocompatible surfactants which associate spontaneously into light-sensitive nanoparticles when dissolved in water.  Nucleic acids (DNA/siRNA) can be loaded inside of the nanoparticles to protect the nucleic acids until they reach the interior of cells.  Similarly, hydrophobic/hydrophilic drug molecules can also be carried within the nanoparticles.  Subsequent exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light leads to nanoparticle dissociation, resulting in the triggered release of nucleic acids, which can then modify the DNA of the cell or stop disease-associated protein production.  Researchers would be able to utilize this gene delivery technology in two different ways: (1) substitution of new genes to the cell, or (2) inactivation of existing genes.  The combination of lower costs (of both the carrier components and the nucleic acids due to higher efficiencies) and faster delivery/transfection rates with our technology compared to current gene-delivery technologies could have a considerable impact throughout the industry.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by providing a fast, low-cost, and easy-to-use DNA sequencer to healthcare providers for clinical use. DNA stores the genetic information of all living organisms and the successful development and commercialization of a fast and low cost DNA sequencing technique will be important not only to the advancement of fundamental medical research in biomarker discovery and oncology studies, but also to the future development of personalized medicine which relies on treating individual patients based on their unique genomic composition. The commercial sequencing methods such as SMRT and NGS require either a high sequencing charge or a large capital investment. The nanofluidic based DNA sequencer is a ?direct' sequencing technique that can be significantly more cost effective than the existing commercial methods.

    This I-Corps project opens up a new path for DNA sequencing. The core technology of the nanofluidic based DNA sequencer is a nanochannel chip with embedded nanoelectrodes capable of determining the sequence a single-stranded DNA by measuring the unique electron tunneling properties of individual nucleotides. Manufacturing of the nanofluidic system involves a sequential application of MEMS processing, atomic force microscopy, and focused ion beam. The nanofluidic system belongs to a group of novel chip-based DNA sequencing techniques which utilize disposable chips to directly measure the DNA sequence. Unlike the commercial methods which rely mostly on biochemical processing, the chip-based methods do not require time-consuming sample pre-processing steps such as PCR nor expensive facilities for parallel processing. The nanofluidic system measures the electron tunneling current of a single DNA strand as it is dragged across a set of nanoelectrodes. Since the molecular structures of the nucleotides in the DNA strand are different, their tunneling currents are also different. The nanofluidic system determines the DNA sequence by analyzing the variation of the tunneling current along the DNA strand.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercialization potential of an integrated converter. The proposed integration not only reduces the weight, volume and cost of onboard power electronic interfaces, but also enhances their efficiencies, and enables bidirectional operation. The team aims at not only fostering the widespread adoption of electric vehicles through improving performance of onboard power electronics, but also looking for other industries that could benefit from this technology. The project has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of electrified transportation systems while enhancing their performance. This work will lead to exploring the commercialization potential of the first integrated onboard charger/converter for plug-in electric vehicles.

    This I-Corps project is aimed at exploring market development and commercialization opportunity of an integrated onboard charger and auxiliary load DC/DC converter for electric vehicles. The proposed technology utilizes silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to take full advantage of wide band gap (WBG) SiC switches, to increase the operation switching frequency, reduce the size of passive components, and reduce cooling requirements, without sacrificing the operation efficiency of the converter. This technology also uses a maximum efficiency tracking strategy to enhance the efficiency of the charger not only at full loads but also particularly at medium and light loads. A proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed technology has been designed, developed and shown to have significant improvement in maximum efficiency in small form factors.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the use of embedded machine listening as a low-cost, turnkey solution for early detection of machinery malfunction and improve predictive maintenance. In manufacturing, sound-based condition monitoring coupled with data-driven maintenance can help significantly reduce unscheduled work stoppages, faulty products and waste of raw materials. Building management systems can be augmented by integrating real-time condition updates for critical machinery such as HVAC units, elevators, boilers and pumps, minimizing disruption for managers and users of those services. This technology is flexible, accurate and data-driven, potentially providing a low barrier to adoption for prospective customers and adaptability to various markets. Beyond predictive maintenance, applications include noise level monitoring for ensuring compliance in workplaces and airports, home and building security, early alert for traffic accidents, bio-acoustic monitoring of animal species, and outdoor noise monitoring at scale for improved enforcement in smart cities.

    This I-Corps project further develops research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the internet of things. The technology consists of a calibrated and highly accurate acoustic sensor with embedded sound recognition AI based on deep learning.  Sound conveys critical information about the environment that often cannot be measured by other means. In manufacturing, early stage machinery malfunction can be indicated by abnormal acoustic emissions. In smart homes and buildings, sound can be monitored for signs of alarm, distress or compliance.  Sound sensing is omnidirectional and robust to occlusion and contextual variables such as lightning conditions at different times of the day. Many existing solutions cannot identify different types of sounds or complex acoustic patterns, making them unsuited for these applications. This solution is both low cost and capable of identifying events and sources at the network edge, thus eliminating the need for sensitive audio information to be transmitted.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve security by providing the strongest levels of network destination control with minimum deployment requirements. This project addresses the problem of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet, which have been used in recent years to silence a variety of organizations, including companies, governments, and non-profits. The proposed mechanism defends against such DDoS attacks, and can improve Internet availability for a variety of customers. Bringing a DDoS-prevention mechanism to market prevents attackers from silencing and denying service to their targets, enabling increased availability to deployments of such systems.

    This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential for a cloud-based traffic filtering technology.  The technology combines two significant, but distinct, approaches to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) prevention - commercial approaches that perform in-cloud filtering to remove the most obvious DDoS traffic, and academic approaches that perform in-network filtering based on protocol-specific fairness criteria. The technology explored combines the in-cloud filtering of existing commercial approaches, together with a mechanism called "capabilities" in the academic approaches, to create an in-cloud, destination-driven enforcement of per-flow bandwidth allocations. This destination-driven approach can enforce a wide variety of destination-specified policies with a single mechanism, and each destination can choose the traffic that it wishes to prioritize. As a result, the same mechanism can to be used to defend against DDoS attacks and to provide priority to certain traffic.

    The broader impact / commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve the information available to workforce planners in a way that reduces the time and money they spend in assessing and anticipating regional workforce needs. With the help of more accurate analytics, workforce planners will be able to shift more of their resources towards designing and developing training initiatives that fill the most likely skills-gaps for workers in the near- to mid-term, thus keeping their regions globally competitive in rapidly-evolving labor markets. The commercial potential of this project derives from advances in computational techniques to identify industry-specific skills gaps empirically; to map the related structure of regional production; and to uncover new skills-induced career pathways in regional economies using those maps. Bringing these technical advances to workforce analysts and policy makers will provide both with the best available tools to respond adaptively to the innovative needs of their economies.

    This I-Corps project uses advanced analytics and Big Data collection methods to assess the technical and spatial distribution of work in cities with the goal of providing insights along three dimensions: patterns of technology diffusion and their workforce implications; human capital-based evolutionary competitive advantages of regional economies; and the structure of regional "economic ecosystems" as a source of entrepreneurship and innovation. The algorithms search the parameter space of regional economic activities, capabilities, and technologies to describe the actual structure of work within a given region. In effect, this innovation enables the automation of key aspects of workforce planning strategy that are typically time-consuming and expensive because they typically rely on surveys. The approach developed here will enhance the speed and accuracy of labor market analysis.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes the commercial availability of affordable monodisperse short  and long polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Areas that will benefit from their commercialization include organic synthesis, bioconjugation, nanotechnology, pharmaceutical chemistry and more. Currently, monodisperse short PEGs can be prohibitively expensive. Many scientists have to devote significant time to synthesize them or have to use less ideal alternative materials. More seriously, there is no technology to synthesize monodisperse long PEGs and scientists in the pharmaceutical industry often use impure PEGs for drug PEGylation (i.e. tagging with PEG).  Commercialization of affordable monodisperse PEGs and their derivatives may transform the ways researchers and manufacturers conduct their projects.

    This I-Corps project explores the market potential of novel technologies that can be used to synthesize polyethylene glycols (PEG) and derivatives in monodisperse form and with much lower costs. Short PEGs are widely used as linkers in areas including organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Long PEGs are used for PEGylating pharmaceuticals to increase water solubility and bio-stability, and to reduce undesirable immune responses and dosing frequency. Currently monodisperse short PEGs can be synthesized via stepwise organic synthesis. However, the process requires chromatography to purify intermediates and product, which consumes large volumes of solvents and silica gel. The waste to product ratio can be over 1000 to 1. For long PEGs, they are made by random polymerization, and there is no technology to make them monodisperse. Therefore, impure PEGs are often used for drug PEGylation. To overcome the challenges in monodisperse PEG production, novel technologies based on solid phase stepwise synthesis will be developed.

    The broader impact and commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide a path for integrating photovoltaics into a wide range of new form factors. The project will first explore the commercial potential of integrating high-performance, light-weight flexible solar panels onto freight truck trailers, shading fabrics, and military tents. When the large exterior surfaces of a freight truck trailer are covered by high-efficiency solar panels the technology can significantly improve overall diesel fuel efficiencies.  Retrofitting flexible solar panels onto shading fabrics, such as canopies, awnings, and car parking ports can potentially allow for local, potentially off-grid, power sources. The flexible solar panels will also potentially help the military cope with their power needs for operations occur in remote locations.  All these applications rely on the new form factors the core technology in this project enables.

    This I-Corps project is based on core technology that overcomes major obstacles in perovskite solar cells, including their short lifetime, lengthy processing steps, and substantial efficiency drops from large-area fabrication on flexible substrates. Commonly used annealing approaches require prolonged heating at high temperatures to attain desired material properties. Therefore, they are not typically compatible with high-speed printing. The technology developed here accomplishes a rapid layer-specific photonic treatment for the target layer without damaging the underlying flexible substrate and perovskite materials. This innovative technology enables large-scale manufacturing of durable and fully-flexible perovskite solar cells through high-speed printing.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project brings several benefits in medical imaging.  These include a substantial improvement in diagnostic image quality and contrast, enhanced soft tissue image resolution, an image method free from ionizing radiation, and substantial reduction in patient discomfort.  This new medical imaging technology will potentially reduce clinical costs by decreasing the number of hospitalizations, surgeries and physician visits.  It is envisioned that the technology will potentially capture a significant part of the imaging contrast agent market and eventually be used to treat not only cancer-related diseases but also other diseases such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and nephrological disorders.

    This I-Corps project aims to improve early cancer diagnosis by developing targeted contrast agents for use with a clinical scanner to improve diagnostic image quality. Small tumors cannot typically be detected using current scanning methods and cancers are often not diagnosed during this early stage when the disease can most susceptible to treatment. The engineered contrast agents we have developed are polymer-based nanoparticles whose external and internal chemistry and morphology can be tailored according to the patient's need.  The nanoparticles have a hollow core with an inner lining of a semiconducting polymer that emits a strong imaging signal when used with a multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) scanner. This imaging modality, known as photoacoustics, is a non-invasive imaging method that provides high spatial resolution and high penetration depth, resulting in a very high-quality image. The combined MSOT/contrast agent technology enables physicians to get real-time anatomical, physiological and functional information of the patient's affected organ.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to promote a liquid organic fertilizer (LOF) produced through a novel patented technology which uses anaerobic accelerated bio-leaching of green plant material or green plant waste. The synthetic free liquid organic fertilizer is a complex solution that contains macro nutrients, micro nutrient as well as organic matter in soluble form. The benefits of the proposed product include: (1) improvement of soil biological activities by providing the soil with soluble organic matter; (2) feeding the plants with soluble macro and micro nutrients; (3) ease of transportation; (4) ease of storage; (5) easy adjustment of the nutrient content through dilution; (6) easy application through irrigation systems and; (7) environmental benefit of carbon sequestration. Since no synthetic chemical is used for LOF production, it has the potential to be used as an economic alternative for currently used organic fertilizers such as fish emulsion and composts by the rapidly growing organic farming industry.

    This I-Corps project enables the extraction of plants macro and micro nutrients and organic matter from the body of green organic waste such as landscape grass clippings. The proposed novel technology consists of two simultaneous processes of anaerobic digestion and accelerated bio-leaching of organic waste to produce liquid organic fertilizer (LOF). Historically, the use of organic waste for production of organic fertilizer has been through composting. Research has shown that the proposed technology will require less time, lower energy consumption and easily available nutrients when compared to composting. In addition, LOF returns the plant organic carbon back to the soil and contributes to carbon sequestration. Previous studies have also shown that the use of LOF could lead to higher yield in vegetables when compared to synthetic fertilizer.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in addressing a substantial challenge in  energy systems. The future electric power grid, commonly referred to as the smart grid, is expected to differ from the current system by the increased integration of distributed generation, demand response and sensing and communication technologies. As distributed energy resources become more prevalent and shape the future of the electric power grid, the overall operational flexibility of the grid increases.  This also means that more control decisions need to be made. This project provides an optimal coordination solution for coordinating geographically scattered energy resources. A commercially viable optimal coordination solution for ever increasing energy resources is crucial for cost efficient generation and dispatch of electricity and ensuring the reliability of the power grid. Specially, focusing on cold chain technologies, this project addresses scalable and flexible control and coordination of distributed refrigeration systems; it is envisioned that the proposed solution and software would turn end-users' pre-installed refrigerators and freezers into an integrated intelligent refrigeration system and significantly improve their energy efficiency.

    This I-Corps project provides a novel distributed control method that addresses a significant operational challenge of the distribution electric grid. Control of energy systems today is largely performed by centralized computing and control solutions run at central units. Increased infeed measurements (sensing data) result in growing stress and extended time for computations. Thus, centralized control solutions may not be feasibly computed and applied in real-time. This project contributes to fundamentally new methodologies and software for distributed computation of control decisions in real-time. Our research provides a promising solution for the intelligent control of distributed energy resources, which enables the efficient interaction and coordination of a variety of components with and by a central unit. The key premise in this research is that if coordinated in an intelligent, predictive and scalable way, operation of numerous energy resources can be optimized in real-time, thereby resolving the issue of scalability. In addition to extending the proposed distributed control methodology toward achieving reliable and cost effective energy and demand side management, this project focuses on commercializing a more target specific extension of the proposed approach directed at minimizing the operational cost of refrigeration systems in cold chain industries through enhanced distributed coordination.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to build a recommender system which assigns values to artifacts and will also provide stakeholders in unregulated markets with better information for reducing risk and improving trust. The Internet and technology have entirely changed the nature of interactions between every business sector, including the art industry, by creating a digital marketplace and introducing additional issues for markets regulation. The proposed recommender system can be used to predict value of investment, to provide an objective value of goods in legal proceedings, insurance cases, and banks as a collateral toll.  This supports financial stability of markets through better decision making and improves the trust of stakeholders in their investments. It also helps to maintain control of the commercial aspects of work. For example, the acquisitions departments of museums would be served by knowing a real value for the artifacts they buy.

    This I-Corps project is focused on building a recommender system for assigning values to artworks using existing datasets and deep knowledge. Art markets are often misvalued which makes the classical approach to building recommender systems rather difficult due to unreliable datasets. Classifiers trained on these datasets often assign inflated prices. A crowd approach is used here which is expected to give more reliable results. Personalization for this class of problems can be achieved by assigning semantic distance.  The project extends the group of classical features by adding semantic features from mining comments given by users, and, for example, from artist biographies, and images of paintings. For each cluster of semantically similar artists, a personalized recommender system for art evaluation is built. Wisdom of the crowd will be used to assign a specific value to an art piece.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to explore the commercial potential of an educational innovation that can transform aspects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and arts education in both formal and informal settings through the construction, analysis, and performance upon a set of custom musical instruments.  By coupling rigorous STEM learning with musical concepts, the technology can engage a diverse group of students in STEM who may otherwise not express an interest.  The technology may be commercialized in a variety of ways, ranging from kits for the home market to complete curricula for school programs.  Commercialization of the technology has significant potential to improve educational outcomes in these important STEM areas.

    This I-Corps project builds upon a technology base of custom acoustical and electronic musical instruments that was initially developed for an educational program that has been attended by over 2,000 people in 10 states at schools, museums, and performing arts centers.  The intellectual merit of the work derives from the close coupling between musical content and state K-12 standards in mathematics, science, and engineering.  A pilot 6-week after school program for third grade students used the technology to draw connections between music and fractions, geometry, the physics of sound, engineering materials, and engineering design, which are all topics in the educational standards for that grade level.  Prototype instruments for higher grade levels illustrate concepts in algebra, pre-calculus, electronics, and computer programming.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide automatic prosthetic tuning technology that will enable the optimization of metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputee users. This product will simplify the process of tuning and will increase the performance of powered prosthetic legs to better assist users and provide more balance while maintaining a lower energy expenditure on residual muscles. Due to the product's user-friendly structure, it could easily be used in less-equipped environments, which will make the technology more accessible and eliminate the discomfort of long commutes to the prosthetic laboratory or clinics. This is a cost-effective solution for not only broader use of powered prosthetic legs, but also better efficiency of prosthetic laboratory and clinics to serve more prosthetic users. This will reduce the cost of maintaining powered prosthetic legs and, broaden the facilities that would offer these types of services. Also, since the system is automated a clinician will replace some of the tasks typically done by prosthetic experts, which is expected to reduce overall costs.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the core technology. Lower limb amputees use prosthetics for daily walking; however, walking with prosthesis typically requires much more metabolic energy expenditure than people with normal gait. Current state-of-the-art technology provides powered prosthetic legs to better assist amputees. To have the best assistance and to increase balance, these legs require a meticulous tuning procedure. It is currently conducted using an observation-based approach by prosthetic experts; however, this approach is not accurate and lacks objectivity. The developed technology is able to wirelessly collect body area sensor signals and provide computational algorithms to automatically setup powered prosthetic legs, which provides a novel and efficient technique for optimizing the metabolic energy expenditure in impaired gait of amputees. This technology will enable an accurate and objective tuning for the users, which is cost effective because it may reduce the need for frequent prosthetic clinics for prosthesis adaptation. In addition, the objective and accurate tuning will maximize the use of powered prosthetic legs.

    The broader impact of this I-Corps project involves a novel probiotic, which potentially treats gut problems including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), weight gain, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  Many key mechanisms of the human body are in part control by the microbes that live in our gut. The way that we currently view, diagnose, and treat many diseases is fundamentally changing with this knowledge. While dozens of diseases are now intrinsically tied with dysbiosis in the gut, of which 1000s of species of microbes reside, we currently have few probiotics as treatment despite the fact that the number of human clinical trials on probiotics in the past 10 years has increased 20-fold. When developed, this technology can potentially be applied to supplements and drugs to help counter noncompliance, and therefore have a significant commercial impact in other fields as well. This is, in addition, to the broad reaching impact on helping individuals with gut problems, which is estimated to be over 50 million. This product also provides an irritant free alternative for those desiring a regular probiotic.

    This I-Corps project surrounds the bacteria, Paenibacillus 79-R4 (Pb 79-R4), which has been isolated and characterized.  In vitro trials show very encouraging results that indicated that this strain drastically reduces enteric methane and hydrogen production, which could be transferred to a commercial product.  Pb 79-R4 eliminates the gases that are positively correlated with gut problems in humans- in animal models the supplemental-Pb strain decreased methane-producing activity by over 50%. This technology will also include a prebiotic and a novel beverage-based interactive mode of delivery, which will work in synergy with the bacteria and lets the user know it is working allowing the effects of the probiotic to work faster and decrease the abandonment period in first-time users. In addition, results from in vitro simulations have resulted in significant reductions in certain pathogens.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to act as a catalyst in the growth of distributed generation and microgrid industries. This artificial intelligence based control system will potentially provide an electrical network that is reliable by reducing outages and restoration costs with incredibly fast bidirectional power flow, secured with real time diagnostics, self-healing and adaptive capabilities, and more economical by reducing equipment failures and minimizing power losses. The product potentially three broad markets, including utilities, distributed generation and consumer. The solution will enhance energy generation from renewables, improve microgrid efficiency, reliability, stability and power quality, and add intelligent control to conventional power systems. Inverter capabilities are presently a significant challenge for integrating distributed generation sources. The proposed innovation would potentially provide an appropriate solution to address this challenge.

    This I-Corps project develops a neural network control technology for microgrid control and management. Microgrids are one path for integrating renewable and distributed generation sources into the grid and can generally support a future smart electricity grid.  A key challenge in microgrid adoption is adequate control of power inverters. Problems include high oscillations when connecting or disconnecting an energy source, fluctuating voltage and frequency, malfunctions and reliability, competing control between inverters, and high harmonic distortions. The proposed innovation uses adaptive dynamic programming and artificial neural networks to implement microgrid control. It integrates into one controller the advantages of conventional control methods, including optimal control, proportional integral control, predictive control, and sliding mode control. The proposed innovation has the potential to overcome the limitations of the conventional control technologies and better meet customer demands and requirements.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to generate technology that improves the accuracy of medical diagnostic tests and eases restrictions on the collection of tissue from patients. If it can be widely disseminated through commercialization, this technology will allow patients to receive a more accurate diagnosis of diseases like cancer, with a more rapid turnaround time and lower cost to the healthcare system. Moreover, secondary biopsies or blood draws that are painful and expensive can be avoided. The project has exceptional potential for commercialization due to the multi-billion dollar market for diagnostic tests at present and due to clear pressing clinical needs to fill in technological gaps that limit the accuracy of diagnostic tests for cancer.

    The I-Corps project is focused on a new generation of light-emitting nanoparticles that function as the critical means to perform measurements in medical diagnostic tests. These new nanoparticles, called quantum dots, provide the new ability to count individual molecules in diseased tissue and in blood, which is a major leap forward in diagnostic testing compared with standard tests that simply provide a qualitative outcome of "high" or "low." Moreover, quantum dots allow the simultaneous interrogation of numerous classes of molecules related to diseases, instead of having to perform repeated tests. Importantly, this technology can be implemented on low-cost instruments that are already widely available in medical diagnostics labs, so there are few barriers preventing entry into the market.  Outcomes have been validated in a research laboratory setting, however they must be scaled for commercialization and finely tuned to meet specific needs in medical diagnostics settings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project it to reduce the impact of future earthquakes.  This smartphone-based crowdsource sensing application provides earthquake alerts and shaking hazard data. The vision is to provide earthquake early warning around the globe, and collect data on building performance.  Warnings can be used to slow and stop trains reducing the likelihood of derailment, to isolate hazardous chemicals and machinery to reduce damage, to move data to safe storage, and to signal individuals to move to a safe place.  Shaking data recoded in buildings can also be used to assess the performance of a building during an earthquake.  Recorded shaking in smaller non-damaging quakes can be used to predict building performance in larger events.  The data recorded by application enabled phones can potentially be used by structural engineers to assess buildings, and can be used by the insurance industry to set premiums.

    This I-Corps project develops a global smartphone-based seismic network.  The technology uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between earthquakes and other sources of shaking as recorded on personal/private smartphones, and is embedded in the application that has been downloaded by over 250,000 users around the world.  When a phone detects an earthquake, it notifies a central server.  The server confirms the earthquake based on multiple phone detection, and estimates the size and location.  An alert could then be issued to users.  At the same time, the phone records the ground shaking during the earthquake.  This timeseries data can be used for a range of purposes including fundamental research on earthquake processes, and characterization of buildings.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to introduce a fully integrated current sensor with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the state-of-art technologies. The developed technology will enable more reliable, efficient and compact power electronics systems. Power electronics is an integral part of today's power delivery systems such as renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, data centers and most consumer electronics. In these applications, electric current information is often an essential parameter that needs to be known and measured for control, diagnostic and prognostic purposes. With advances in power electronic circuits with specific attention to high frequency power converters, there is a need to investigate alternative approaches and techniques to measure the current. These approaches should result in availability of current sensors that have fast-response, are accurate, loss-less, and preferably non-intrusive. The impact of such a sensor is to enable systems and circuits that will be miniaturized and more efficient through the use of wide band-gap semiconductors and high switching frequencies. Additionally, the availability of current measurement information will lead to greater reliability and prognostic capability. Applications include power converters in electric vehicles and data centers.

    This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of the current sensor technology in different industry sectors such as automotive, telecommunications, and data centers. Today, there is no current sensor that can be used in many power electronics systems or integrated into semiconductor modules optimized to operate with switching frequencies beyond 1MHz. This project will address the need and requirements for such sensors by moving away from commonly-used Hall-Effect sensors and utilizing magneto-resistors. With proprietary IC circuitry and packaging, the project team is developing contactless, lossless sensors with bandwidths up to 10 MHz, while overcoming the measurement challenges due to EMI, asymmetrical current distributions and non-uniform magnetic field.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to create a closed loop synthetic carbon cycle that addresses both carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation as well as generating high value hydrocarbons from waste CO2 feedstock. Currently, fossil-fuel-fired power plants typically exhibit significant emissions of CO2.  The process developed here has the potential to capture this waste CO2 and repurpose it towards generation of hydrocarbon fuels and other high value hydrocarbons. It presents an opportunity for these electricity generation units to add profit margin in their business model based on these hydrocarbon chemicals. Similar opportunities are available to positively impact many other industries, as well.

    This I-Corps project develops a sustainable repurposing of CO2. The process, reverse water gas shift chemical looping (RWGS-CL) has demonstrated capability of converting CO2 to CO at high rates and at low temperatures, paving the way for implementation at large scale. The temperatures of operation of RWGS-CL allows for thermal integration with Fischer Tropsch process (FTS). With FTS reactors already being used in industrial scale, the reactor module developed here can potentially find an appropriate use in those industries. This process involves the use of stable catalysts that can be used for several cycles without loss of activity. The process is designed such that there is no intermixing of CO and H2O or H2, thereby restricting any methane formation or any backward reaction.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the creation of a platform technology with a rapidly deployable, motorized arm that can be used wherever rapid, precise positioning of objects is required.  There are many potential medical, commercial, industrial, and consumer applications for the technology.  In the industrial sector there are needs to position and hold for assembly, soldering, gluing, welding, or metrology.  The device can also support needs for mechanical assistance during disassembly and re-assembly in maintenance operations.  Consumer applications include holding tablets, books, or laptops and adjustable workbench arms.  Medical applications include surgical retraction and surgical device or tool holding, including laparoscopic instruments.  The first target application in development is an abdominal surgical retraction system that can be deployed and/or adjusted within seconds.  A rapidly deployable retractor reduces operating room and anesthesia times.  Further, since the retractor arm is disposable, the risk of infection is reduced, and the need for cleaning, sterilization, and maintenance is eliminated.

    This I-Corps team has developed a device that consists of a motorized base with an attached flexible arm that can be locked into place and/or adjusted in seconds at the push and release of a button.  Various grippers can be attached to the end of the arm to firmly and steadily grasp or support an object at any orientation.  The speed and flexibility of these devices provide advantages over slower, manually operated fixtures, especially when working in and around complex geometries or fragile environments.  The intellectual property consists of a unique joint surface that permits the mechanical arm to be made much longer and stronger than competing systems.  A first generation system that operates as a surgical retractor was built and demonstrated before surgeons in mock scenario in a hospital operating room.  It was shown to be capable of providing adequate retraction force for abdominal surgeries.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project entails increasing the ability of commercial users of mass spectrometry to bring better products to market through the use of technology that better molecular identification and quantification. Commercial users of mass spectrometry include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, and other companies that have a direct impact on public health and wellbeing and are currently limited in social impact and revenue, in part, due to the inability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in mass spectrometry samples.  Specific applications for the technology includes research and development on a variety of products, including diagnostic tests, novel drugs, and personalized medicine.

    This I-Corps project will investigate the commercial delivery of mass spectrometry data processing services. The underlying technology advances current capabilities by combining advanced statistical methods, additional information present in mass spectrometry signals but not used by current approaches, and novel methods for interpretation to identify more molecules than current mass spectrometry approaches with more quantitative accuracy than current approaches. The research is particularly capable of detecting low abundance molecules, which are exceptionally difficult to detect with current methods, and are more likely to have biological significance than high abundance molecules. Corporate mass spectrometry users can use accurate identifications and quantifications of low abundance molecules to shorten time-to-market, reduce development costs, and increase the production throughput and significance of innovations across a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to provide K-12 schools with a learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training to expand and improve computer science education and to encourage a diverse student population to pursue further studies in computing. Computer science has become a core 21st century skill critical to careers both within and beyond the tech industry, but K-12 education has yet to meet increasing demand from industry and from parents to teach computing, and school districts still struggle to adequately train teachers and to engage students in computer science. This project provides a simple and easy-to-use solution that integrates music with computer science to drive student engagement. Moreover, this approach contributes to a diverse computer science pipeline by engaging female and minority students through an emphasis on creativity and real-world applications. Today there is a market for schools to train teachers, and to buy materials and tools to teach computer science.

    This I-Corps project leverages an online learning environment, curriculum, and teacher training designed for any introductory computing course from late elementary through to the college level, along with a body of research assessing the effects of this learning intervention on student content knowledge and engagement in computing. The web-based learning platform includes a code editor, a multi-track audio player, an audio loop library, an interactive textbook, and mechanisms for students to share and collaborate, along with curricular, training, and grading tools for teachers. Mixed-methods research has shown significant student gains in both content knowledge and engagement across gender and demographic groups when learning with this approach, with particularly large gains in engagement for female students. Students ascribe their increased engagement in computing to the creative, expressive, and real-world approach of the intervention through its combination of popular music and music production techniques with computational thinking and programming in industry-relevant coding languages.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project stems
    from the fact that pharmaceuticals and herbicides have been detected in some water
    supplies at concentrations that may have the potential to affect human biology.
    \ Furthermore, these contaminants continue to accumulate.  Current water bottlers
    and home filtration systems do not typically remove these chemicals, and the approaches
    that do sufficiently purify water are expensive and generate large volumes of
    polluted water as a by-product.  There is a significant opportunity for safe,

    protein-based materials can specifically remove bioactive contaminants and pharmaceuticals
    from water.   By adding new ligand binding proteins to these materials, the filters
    developed in this work can be readily adapted to bind a wide variety of chemicals
    and even toxins with very high affinity and specificity."

    Tephritid fruit fly Multidisciplinary Australian Research Collaboration for Biosecurity (T-MARC-BIO), a Track I IRES project at Eastern Mennonite University (EMU), will engage 18 undergraduate students from the state of Virginia to gain multidisciplinary research experience in Australia that will advance basic science and address internationally significant challenges in ensuring biosecurity and a robust global food supply chain. Students will be recruited from EMU and neighboring institutions to conduct research on fruit flies (Tephritidae), which are among the most damaging horticultural insect pests worldwide, constituting pest management issues, trade barriers, and invasion threats for Australia, the U.S., and throughout the tropics and subtropics. The results of this research will have an impact on integrated pest management, which is a critical component of sustainable agro-ecological systems in the U.S. and worldwide. With good cause, the public is becoming increasingly concerned about the health and environmental impacts of synthetic pesticides, and their use is becoming highly restricted. The T-MARC-BIO program will add to the toolkit of effective, long-term strategies for both pest control and monitoring of invasive species, while minimizing the impacts of pesticides on human and environmental health. American students will gain valuable research experience through conducting projects in the multidisciplinary settings in Australia, as well as the life-changing learning, interpersonal skills, empathy, and global awareness that come from living and working in a foreign country. T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.

    Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this acoustic monitoring technology for remote pumping equipment is to help ensure the reliable and continuous flow of critical products, such as public water or oil and gas while increasing societal well-being and reducing industrial carbon footprint.  The initial focus will be on equipment such as compressors, valves or pumps located in a remote or dangerous location. This novel acoustic method and the corresponding AI analytics brings novel and advanced functionalities at a fraction of the cost of existing methods. This allows users such as water companies or oil producers to reduce the energy needs of their equipment while reducing downtime and enabling early detection of many types of failures.

    This I-Corps project further develops an acoustic monitoring platform for remote pumping equipment.  It is a full stack internet of things solution for the monitoring, diagnostic and control of industrial equipment. Acoustic monitoring is a novel method that uses sensors to detect complex issues in remote pumping equipment. Simple surface sensors give important insight on the running condition of underground or remote equipment by integrating acoustic sensing with AI analytics. A control solution then adjusts the running condition of the equipment to extend its lifetime and increase its efficiency. The proposed industrial control solution aims to reduce down time, decrease leakage and increase the efficiency and output of many industrial pumps.

    This IRES Track I project will support collaborative research to develop new algorithms and techniques for reliability-aware physical design and optimization of VLSI systems. U.S. students will be trained through collaborative research between two teams -- UCR's VLSI System and Computation Research Lab (VSCLAB) and Tsinghua University's Design Automation Lab.   Each year five American students will participate in the IRES program. IRES students will spend 10 weeks (one academic quarter) at UCR and 10 weeks at Tsinghua University, China. Specific IRES collaborative research, education and culture activities are planned to expose U.S. undergraduate or graduate students to the global engineering education and research environment through US-China academic collaboration. The collaborative educational and research activities will provide unique training, mentoring, networking and intellectual development opportunities for students at UCR, which is a growing and Minority Serving Institution. This project thus provides a unique opportunity to contribute to diversity in the U.S. technical workforce. Such international engagement will benefit the students' entire careers and make them more competitive and competent in their careers as scientists and engineers.  Furthermore, building long-term connections with top-tier engineering schools like Tsinghua University will help U.S. scientists and engineers maintain competitiveness in the long term.  Finally, the joint research will strengthen existing computer engineering research and education programs, and broaden the collaborative research work at UCR.

     The IRES collaborative project will produce important research advances through joint development of efficient algorithms and design methodologies to address the grand challenges of reliability-aware physical design and optimization of VLSI systems. The researchers will work on the most severe and challenging aspects of verification and design problems of silicon CMOS based integrated systems in current and coming 10nm/7nm nodes: modeling, analysis of long-term interconnect reliability effects such as electromigration (EM), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), bias temperature instability (BTI) and reliability-aware physical design and optimization. The mutual interests and complementary knowledge, and established trust between the two research teams is critical for the success of the student training, mentoring and the proposed joint research project. The education and research activities of this joint project consist of following activities: student training, mentoring and intellectual development via pre-trip preparation and on-site visits; new courses and seminar development for proposed research topics; joint research projects and student supervision and publications; promoting and nurturing diverse cohorts of U.S. students; evaluation for continuous improvement of the program.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will be accomplished through helping more than 85 million US pet owners and their pets, as owning a companion animal is associated with improved well-being. The provisional-patent-protected innovation, a single-test immunoassay for pet disease diagnosis, is expected to lead to significant outcomes in the animal healthcare commercial market, with an option of expanding to other markets.

    This project is based on technology that combines in a single test (such as a paper strip test) the high sensitivity, selectivity and wide working range of the particle immunoassay for diagnosing pets' diseases at various stages. The unique feature of our test is high sensitivity with the incorporated protection against false-negative analytical bias caused by the high dose effect, which is important for the diagnostic accuracy of late- and early-stage disease. The selectivity of the test has been demonstrated to detect about 0.01 Units per milliliter of ovarian cancer biomarker 125 in human blood plasma, with near single-molecule assay selectivity. In the proof-of-concept experiment, the proposed approach was modified based on the heterogeneous-media encapsulation of gold nanoparticles modified with biotin and iron oxide microparticles modified with streptavidin. This test offers significant competitive advantages over existing technologies: it can be used for early- and late-stages of disease; manufacturing and operational costs are low, based on a cheap point-of-care application; and it offers the possibility of detecting multiple modalities of disease in one test.

    Supercomputers enable researchers to push the boundaries of science and find innovative approaches to complex problems. From improving advanced manufacturing with modeling and simulation to understanding earth systems and weather with greater precision, harnessing the data revolution and applying data to understand life processes, supercomputers are essential to human advancement.  HPC (High Performing Computer) systems of the future will likely be very different from those of today. Emerging architectures can have a tremendous impact on the development of software, methods and models that can take advantage of these new features resulting in speed up and improvement in the accuracy of calculations. Early adoption of these emerging technologies to take advantage of special features is key to remaining competitive in the global economy. The goal of this IRES site is to engage PhD. students in research learning experiences that increase their capacity to conduct research on supercomputing systems, (including those with classical and emerging architectures), and their exposure to international collaborative research.

    This IRES, called ASSURE, aims to enhance the capabilities of US graduate students to develop Algorithms and Software in key scientific disciplines that benefit from Supercomputers and emerging aRchitEctures (ASSURE). The program focuses on equipping students to conduct research on one of the fastest supercomputers in the world, Sunway Taihulight, housed in Wuxi China, which has a unique architecture. ASSURE achieves this goal by: (i) training students to utilize unique international large-scale systems; (ii) engaging students in high quality collaborative research in four key areas of computational and data science utilizing these systems; and (iii) exposing students to international large-scale research environments that prepare them with cultural and professional skills required to occupy international leadership roles. Specifically, IRES students at this site will conduct research at two locations in China: The National Supercomputing Center (NSCC) in Wuxi China and the University of Tsinghua and the East China Normal University.

    The ASSURE site is open to US Ph.D. students with an interest in computational and data science in the areas of earth systems, drug design, advanced manufacturing, big data and machine learning. Specifically, US citizens or permanent residents, including women and students from underrepresented populations in international STEM research, are invited to participate.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a novel prosthesis that addresses many health concerns addressed by the more than 600,000 individuals in the lower limb amputee population. The amputee population exhibits many day-to-day challenges associated with mobility tasks such as descending stairs, or even level ground walking. This projects seeks to develop an ankle prosthesis that addresses many of these needs while maintaining a small, quiet, and lightweight package. No other prosthesis on the commercial market exhibits the same functionality as this device, and therefore, there exists a gap in the market that can be filled by this device.

    This I-Corps project is based on a novel ankle prosthesis, utilizing a novel actuator. This novel actuator allows this device to exhibit the following three mechanical functions: 1) high torque locking under load; 2) high-power dissipation under load; and 3) low-power generation in the absence of a load. These functions allow amputees to adapt to various terrains, gain support during standing, perform stair descent like healthy subjects as well as lift their toe during swing to avoid tripping. A prototype device has been created, and is to be assessed on amputees to determine its biomechanical benefit.

    number of teams that will receive funding for prototyping/proof of concepts supplies,
    coach expense, and exploratory customer market activities. The Simones Center's
    approach to entrepreneurship is experiential and multidisciplinary. RIT is situated
    to pioneer an I-Corps Site because of its history with experiential learning (coop,
    industry relationships, history of practitioners in the classroom etc.) and its
    program diversity. The Simone Center programs integrate technology, design, and
    business perspectives in a holistic manner. Teams simultaneously enter a program
    with formalized training and curriculum and weekly coaching by an experienced
    cohort of industry-based entrepreneurs and product developers. \n\nThis proposal
    provides broader impacts to society and Rochester region in several ways:\n-The
    Creation of Entrepreneurial Assets: RIT will increase the number of graduates
    with an emphasis on STEM and design with business creation/tech commercialization
    knowledge, experience, and teams building skills to innovate throughout their
    careers.\n-New Ventures: The Student Incubator has and will continue to create
    a variety of companies that have growth and provided economic development to the
    struggling Rochester Region. \n-Pipeline Development: RIT will provide a pre-seed/early
    stage pipeline for potential new ventures.  \n-Successful Undergraduate Innovation
    Processes: This program promotes and advances the development of balanced student
    teams, experienced coaching, and access to university support services (prototyping
    labs, faculties, and other expertise). \n-Integration with a Preexisting Business
    Incubator: The Simone Center's programs and events target early stage business
    development. The Simone Center's Student Incubator Program transitions its investment
    ready projects/businesses to the pre-existing RIT Incubator allows each unit to
    focus on the a specific stage of new venture creation. This is also a potential
    process for learning and dissemination.\nThis is a project at an institution that
    serves a very large population of deaf students (the largest population in the

    impact of launching innovative products and immersing students in an entrepreneurship
    curriculum. RIT has a track record of successes - in particular, they have a history
    of launching \"game-centric\" and visual media products.\n\n\nThe Site has the
    potential to have a large regional impact in a part of the country that has been
    economically depressed. There is a large team of volunteers willing to mentor
    students as well as an Advisory Board to guide the programs."

    The Shiraki International Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research (SIMuR) project is a collaboration between faculty and students at three public universities (Bridgewater State University, University of California San Diego, and Ilia State University in Georgia) and the National Academy of Sciences of Georgia. The SIMuR project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research of historical and ongoing human-environmental interactions in the Shiraki Plateau in the southeastern part of the country of Georgia. The project will strengthen scientific knowledge, technical and leadership skills of a cohort of diverse, globally competent, and engaged young STEM researchers. This international research experience will embed students in a cross-country and cross-disciplinary research effort while getting them acquainted with the national specifics of this culturally-rich strategic region. SIMuR will increase STEM engagement and literacy in underserved communities in rural Georgia and the US, bringing advanced data science, visualization and spatial and temporal analysis concepts and technologies into this cross-country collaboration, thus improving the capacity of students and universities to address research problems of global significance.

    Specifically, understanding the interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors in the history of human settlement on the Shiraki Plateau is a part of the interdisciplinary challenge of identifying and modeling impacts of human and environmental changes influencing the rise and decline of civilizations. With the goal of contributing to this developing body of knowledge, SIMuR will engage 15 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University (5 students each year) in high-quality interdisciplinary research collaborations with Georgian peers and mentorship from an international group of experts in geological sciences, cyber-archaeology, computer engineering, information management, and data science. Participants will also engage in STEM outreach to underserved communities in southeastern Georgia and Massachusetts. Both the research and educational components of the project will build on a confluence of advanced technologies to clarify the several competing hypotheses of the depopulation of the Shiraki Plateau, the site of a recently discovered early civilization. The active reconsideration of the early human history of this area by the research community, and rapidly growing additional data from archaeological excavations and field observations in geology, hydrology, paleo-ecology and related fields, will make this an unprecedented opportunity for students to engage in the science debate, develop field research and analysis skills, and deepen their understanding of this rapidly developing culturally diverse area. By creating and disseminating findings in accessible online locations, the project will increase equitable access to authentic scientific data to scientists, educators, and underserved communities in US and throughout the world. Recruitment will focus on undergraduate students from groups traditionally underserved in STEM fields, low-income and first-generation college students.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    Functional Morphology and Comparative Anatomy are the studies of how bodies work in humans and other animals, disciplines of research that began and continue, to this day, in the collections in Paris.  In this IRES project, new generations of students will be taught to test hypotheses across species using cutting-edge tools in functional morphology and comparative biology,  subjects that are of interest to the great number of students interested in careers in STEM fields,  thus attempting to inspire this focal 21st Century work-force growth in a place that formed the foundation of the discipline over the last many centuries.  Approximately seven undergraduate students a year will be recruited from diverse backgrounds (including recruitment from colleges and universities that serve historically underrepresented groups) and trained in techniques that span live animal behavior, muscle dissection, analyses of bones, teeth and skulls and finally how to make inferences about the behavior and abilities of extinct species from the shapes of their fossils.  Not only will students learn these technical skills, but through working with senior professors and their international teams of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, they will learn the "soft skills" of collaborating across academic teams and cultures.  Students will gain these skills and earn authorship on professional presentations and potentially publications, giving them the possibly life changing experiences that may form the core of their continued pursuit of STEM interests and careers.

    The overarching goal of this project is to train diverse cohorts of students in burgeoning 21st century functional morphology and comparative anatomy techniques.  Students will be trained in key techniques the US PI's lab (at North Carolina State University) prior to being accompanied to Paris to work in the lab of one of his collaborators at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle where they will have access to centuries-old collections and the other biological research institutions in the region.  There, with the mentorship of the professors and their senior postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, the IRES students will develop independent or group projects that focus on modern approaches to functional morphology and comparative anatomy research questions.  These may include 1) behavioral research and experimentation at several zoological facilities (including access to a colony of mouse lemurs, or work with species like the greater bamboo lemur, that are not held in captivity outside of France), 2) dissection work with fresh specimens or specimens from the museum's expansive fluid collection, and analyses of osteological or dental material from 3) modern species or 4) the famous fossil collections also housed in this historically significant museum collection.  These studies may ultimately allow the IRES students to use this knowledge about the behavior and anatomy of extant species to evaluate the adaptations of extinct species.

    from the California State University (CSU) system through collaborative research
    projects and educational experience on the ATLAS experiment of the Large Hadron
    Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland.
    This program will send 6 CSU students per year to work on ATLAS research projects
    for ATLAS detector upgrades and incoming ATLAS Run-3 data taking and physics.
    The physics potential of incoming Run-3 will be over 10 times greater than Run-1
    during which the Higgs boson was discovered. The Higgs discovery by ATLAS and
    CMS experiments of LHC in 2012 has captured the attention and imagination of the
    public and students throughout the world. This International Research Experiences
    for Students (IRES) project will support 18 students over three years working
    on ATLAS experiment of LHC at CERN.  This project is focused on the largest university
    system in the country with 23 campuses and a total student population of ~490,000.
    Because CSU has very large minority and first-generation college student populations,
    student recruitment in this project will attract underrepresented as well as female
    students.  \n\nThe CSU students will validate the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations,
    improve ATLAS software packages, and work on searching for new physics from ATLAS
    data. On ATLAS detector upgrades, the students will work on the installation,
    operation, and data analysis of ATLAS pixel detector, and improving software packages
    in monitoring various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition
    (DAQ), the students will install and test Fast Tracker (FTK) boards, improve and
    optimize FTK variable resolution patterns, and conduct offline and online testing
    of FTK performance. The students will also attend the renowned CERN Summer Student
    Lecture Series given by top physicists from all over the world. Upon returning
    to the US, student participants will give colloquia, seminars, and invited talks
    at CSU campuses, high schools, and local communities about their ATLAS research
    work and the CERN summer experience. Through the CSU Fresno PHYS 168S (?Physics
    Outreach?) course, the ATLAS students in PHYS 168S will visit at least two new
    K-12 classrooms each week to teach kinds about the CSU ATLAS and IRES programs
    and encourage them to pursue science. These outreach efforts will reach very large
    number of schools, their students and students? families in the Fresno and Central
    Valley area.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed

- abstractText: "Biodiversity loss, climate variability, and pollution are major threats
    to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life. Addressing these human-environment
    interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems as they
    contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate
    regulation, and filter pollutants from water and air. Despite their importance,
    current policies are still largely ineffective as indicated by continued significant
    tropical forest loss over the past several decades. This NSF International Research
    Experience for Students award will support U.S. student projects across forests
    in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda to analyze how international variation in environmental
    policies influences land use practices and how these practices affect conservation
    outcomes related to forest condition and primate biology. By examining similar
    forests with different environmental policies and different forests with similar
    environmental policies, we will be able to evaluate the largescale effectiveness
    of conservation incentives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and
    ecotourism, alongside the effects of agricultural practices linked to deforestation,
    air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Through this research program,
    underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental
    sciences will gain international field research experience in collaboration with
    the Organization for Tropical Studies and Makerere University Biological Field
    Station. Students will work closely with local field assistants and communities
    during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange.
    At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results
    to local communities and host country scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged
    to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations
    at professional conferences. An additional end product associated with this program
    and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable
    of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus
    transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure. Results from this research
    program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining
    both biodiversity and human livelihoods. \n\nTropical forests are one of the world's
    most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating
    climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities.
    Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly
    reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations
    that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation. Primate populations
    have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable
    or endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened
    species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such
    as national parks. However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for
    subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached, thus weakening the
    effectiveness of protected areas. As a result, conservation policies have evolved
    from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities
    by providing economic and other incentives. Despite the increasing promotion of
    community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence
    exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest
    quality or sustaining primate populations. Therefore, this NSF IRES research program
    has two main objectives: 1) To utilize international variation in environmental
    policies that integrate conservation and development objectives, such as payments
    for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, for an analysis of the effectiveness
    of conservation strategies for both protecting tropical forests and their primates
    and maintaining human livelihoods; and 2) To provide international field research
    experience to underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the
    environmental sciences. To meet these objectives, 15 upper level undergraduate
    and early career graduate student projects will examine the extent to which differing
    economic and participatory incentives and agricultural practices influence conservation
    outcomes as measured by on the ground data collected on forest condition (e.g.,
    fragment size, % canopy cover, biomass) and primate biology (i.e., physiology,
    behavior, and population size) across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda.
    At these sites, students will survey primate populations using line transects,
    quantify differences in primate behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels
    with immunoassays, conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, government
    officials and other stakeholders, and quantify forest characteristics using GIS
    and field methods. Students will also examine the effects of these strategies
    on local community livelihoods and how these effects influence local perception
    of environmental policy. Results from this project will add significantly to the
    knowledge of how economic and participatory incentives can affect conservation
    decisions and outcomes. As a breakdown in socio-environmental systems will negatively
    affect both humans and biodiversity, quantifying the effectiveness of various
    environmental management strategies to maintain biodiversity and local community
    livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually meeting their
    sustainability and conservation goals.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    Porous materials are ubiquitous: soils and rocks support habitat and store energy, cementitious materials are the building blocks of infrastructure,  and our body is made of porous tissues. Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled "Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.

    Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French "Grandes Ecoles", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    The objective of this IRES project is to provide U.S. students with international research experience in superconducting electronics and circuits as future computing paradigms in Yokohama National University (YNU), Japan, which has one of the world's strongest research center in superconducting electronics and circuits. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit YNU over a period of eight (8) weeks. The project will enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on next-generation superconducting electronics, in collaboration with their faculty mentors in YNU. Such experiences expose U.S. students to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. Through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the research of superconducting electronics, on the culture in Japan, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through the personal social media, Web 2.0 based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for local schools. It will be beneficial for the STEM and underrepresented student education as well as the advancing of superconducting and semiconductor industry in U.S.

    Being widely-known for low energy dissipation and ultra-fast switching speed, Josephson Junction-based superconductor logic families have been proposed and implemented to process analog and digital signals. It has been perceived to be important candidate to replace state-of-the-art CMOS due to the superior potential in operation speed and energy efficiency. The project contains well-planned recruitment, preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research address fundamental problems in the circuit design, electronic design automation, and applications in superconducting electronics that need to be addressed urgently. The first project deals with the integration of AQFP technology with the efficient implementation of deep learning systems, where the latter is a core research topic in hardware and AI. The second project deals with efficient design of AQFP and RSFQ superconducting circuits and will greatly enhance the performance, efficiency and reliability. The third project aims to develop a design automation toolflow of superconducting electronics, which is currently lacking and will significantly reduce the development time of superconducting circuits. It is anticipated that with the close interaction with YNU, the breakthroughs made from these projects can have a significant impact on future superconducting electronics development and supercomputing systems, as well as the technology in the U.S. in corresponding areas.

- abstractText: "This award supports international research experiences for U.S. undergraduate
    students from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) at the University of Victoria
    (UVic) in Canada in interdisciplinary research representing the fields of bioengineering
    and neuroscience. The project engages primarily Hispanic engineering students
    at UTEP, a majority Hispanic 4-year, public institution. Reciprocal visits to
    UTEP by UVic students will be supported with Canadian funds.  UTEP students will
    be afforded professional development and educational opportunities in cutting-edge
    research.  Specifically, the project engages the synergism of stem cell biology
    with advanced 3-dimensional biomaterial technology to manufacture tissue from
    stem cells. Generating patient-specific \"artificial\" tissue allows the researchers
    to control the rate of growth and differentiation of stem cells.  This research
    is significant in paving the way for modeling disease and for future drug development.
    \ \n\nWorking together, the interdisciplinary team aims to identify unique approaches
    of targeting differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] into
    neural phenotypes by utilizing advanced materials and processing. Specifically,
    the UTEP team has expertise in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture
    and 3D bioprinting, and UVic has expertise in culturing neuronal differentiation
    of human iPSC on fibrin-based scaffolds. The research focus is the application
    of microfluidic-based 3D bioprinting for coprinting of human iPSCs together with
    biomaterial scaffolds to generate bio-composites of the desired architecture with
    high fidelity. Bioprinting iPSCs with advanced biomaterials and scaffolds bears
    the promise to develop 3D tissues, ideally including encapsulated cells and facilitating
    their proliferation, and targeted differentiation. The project enables addressing
    critical questions in the field: 1) How can advanced materials and their unique
    designs facilitate stem cell culture and promote their differentiation? 2) How
    can 3D bioprinting be applied as an advanced manufacturing technique to mimic
    the complex environment for regulating growth and differentiation of stem cells?
    3) Does the differentiated progeny of cells cultured atop micro-textured scaffolds
    exhibit enhanced functionality and phenotype, compared with controls? Thus, the
    scientific goal is to better understand the role of growth factors and micro-environmental
    niche and cues released from biomaterial scaffolds in the regulation of adult
    human iPSC differentiation into neural phenotypes. It is widely known that distractive
    biomaterial scaffolds that incorporate patterned structures and specific compartments
    of growth factors can more intricately guide stem cell development. Achieving
    this goal enables the ability to address fundamental neurobiological questions
    about neuronal growth, differentiation, which is essential for designing treatments
    for nervous system disorders or traumatic brain injury.\n\nThis award reflects
    NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation
    using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The students will be mentored by internationally-renowned researchers in the field. The students? projects in the field of testing and quality assurance will be led by researchers from the Czech Technical University and experts from Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open-source enterprise software solutions. The student research and experiments will be performed at the Software Testing IntelLigent Lab at the Czech Technical University in Prague and at the Red Hat research facility located in Brno, Czech Republic. Students will gain complete knowledge of the test development cycle, modern testing toolkits, production-level development, and research skills. Students will research novel code-inspection techniques, further enabling knowledge in this field and boosting the capabilities of the U.S. software industry. The remote sites selected for the research experiences will provide students with a unique opportunity to work with an internationally-renowned research team that has extensive expertise in model-based testing. These experiences will enable the participating students to start their research or academic careers. The students will bring their new expertise and skills back to the U.S., leading to improved economic competitiveness in the field of distributed software systems, quality assurance and stronger partnerships between academia and industry.

    This project will provide computer science students with the opportunity to research novel code-inspection mechanisms for extracting module information and ensuring the proper functioning and interaction between all modules in a distributed software system. The research collaboration will involve Baylor University, the Czech Technical University in Prague, and industry partner Red Hat. Collaborators from the Czech Technical University in Prague specialize in test automation, experimental model-based testing, coverage optimization algorithms, and verification models. Red Hat is the market leader in open-source middleware and enterprise technologies, with unmatched expertise in production-level quality assurance and testing practice. Baylor University collaborators specialize in code inspection and code transformations. Interaction and collaboration of these three partnering groups will facilitate knowledge exchange and improvements of test automation and quality assurance of distributed systems. Student researchers will use existing open-source code-inspection tools and help develop and apply new ones. This IRES project will advance knowledge of code-inspection techniques to improve module testing and quality assurance processes in distributed systems. It will also help with the automation of model construction for model-based testing approaches that will lead to improved test generation, test coverage validation, verification of module information compliance, and more in this field. Student's individual open-source projects created during their research experience will directly contribute to improved testing and quality assurance in distributed software systems. The results will, in the end, help reduce efforts and costs related to testing and improve quality assurance of future software products, leading to fewer defects and bugs in products before customer release.

    This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) is focused on mapping and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people in Rwanda. Over a three year period, fourteen U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and three undergraduate students from the Monroe Community College Geospatial Information Science and Technology program (MCC) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience at the University of Rwanda Center for Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing (CGIS). Significant activities include student access to and learning from CGIS on displaced population natural disaster resilience issues unique to Rwanda, East African context student research training activities, and access to disaster management organizations focused on displaced people such as the Rwandan Ministry of Disaster Management and Refugee Affairs (MIDIMAR) only available in Rwanda. The project will create unique linkages to East African organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop 17 STEM student research scientists over three years focused on disaster resilience, displacement and GIS. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups as we will fully leverage RIT's existing underrepresented recruitments networks such as RIT's large Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing population, women, and minorities. The MCC student will create a unique opportunity for undergraduate international research experience as well as community college international research capacity development. Displaced people in Rwanda will also benefit through their participation as field research assistants as well as the research providing outreach and advocacy for their situations. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as community-scale resilience maps displacement resilience indexes will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to displacement and disaster resilience research and GIS. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of Rwandan and East African research networks only available by being on-site in Rwanda. CGIS and MIDIMAR for the first time become linked to NSF research. Workshops on disasters and resilience GIS mapping will be conducted by IRES students with Rwandan secondary schools and disaster stakeholder groups for broader project outreach. If successful, findings will be generalizable for additional internationally-focused research beyond displaced population natural disaster resilience in Rwanda (for example, the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises) and particularly US-national interest disaster resilience and displacement issues like seen in hurricanes Harvey and Maria, creating the potential for broader US-national and international research on displaced population natural disaster resilience that can provide future students with the knowledge, motivation and inspiration to pursue internationally-focused science careers to solve US-national and global challenges.

    The primary student research project goal is community-level scale field mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of resilience indicators relevant to displaced population natural disaster resilience. Data collected by IRES students will be used as an input for spatially modeling, indexing and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people. The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between displacement and natural disaster resilience. Spatial indexes of displaced population natural disaster resilience currently do not exist at any scale -  let alone at the community-level scale that will only be possible to investigate through the foreign research site. Student research efforts will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) the spatial relationships between displacement and disaster resilience, (b) how developing displacement disaster resilience spatial metrics can inform displacement planning, and (c) how resilience is developed and manifested in displacement and disaster contexts to inform disaster management decision making and risk-reduction. Rwanda is a unique location for research on mapping and quantifying displaced population natural disaster resilience due to both refugee populations and internally displaced Rwandan citizens who face natural disaster risks. Access to these diverse and unique groups is only possible by being in Rwanda.

    The broader impacts of this I-Corps project are to improve hands-on laboratory experiences in the field of materials science and to increase STEM awareness for students/instructors at the 9-12 and undergraduate levels. The educational kit bridges the gap between theoretical and practical molecular materials technologies. The kit is an interactive learning tool designed for interdisciplinary laboratory activities and can be used in physics, chemistry, engineering, and material science educational settings. The kits provide all needed materials, a fully developed curriculum, and training for implementation. Professional development workshops for instructors help to integrate the laboratory activities into instructor?s existing science curriculum while addressing national and international science standards. There is a significant market for hands-on laboratory activities that incorporate contemporary science experiments currently under investigation and development at the university level. School districts and science / engineering departments will likely be interested in acquiring the kits, making them a commercially impactful and important education platform. The kit is flexible and can be expanded upon to include future experiments and professional development. The kits can also be used and developed for extracurricular activities such as science fairs and competitions.

    This I-Corps project involves a polymer electronics laboratory kit to improve materials science education for 9-12 and undergraduate students. The three-module kit and curriculum use polymer semiconductors to provide hands-on inquiry activities integrating themes of electrical conductivity, light emission, and light-harvesting solar energy conversion. These themes are critical to contemporary materials science research and education. The kit includes materials to evaluate the electrical properties of conductive colloidal polyaniline inks, to construct a polymer light- emitting diode using polyphenylene vinylene, and to build a polymer solar cell using semiconductive polymers and nanoparticulate TiO2. Designed initially for high school science classrooms, the activities developed also meet new collegiate undergraduate education requirements for macromolecular, supramolecular, and nanoscale systems in the curriculum and can be used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. The modules and kit have also been implemented in professional development workshops for training 9&#8722;12 science educators to help integrate the laboratory activities into their curriculum.

    This IRES project is co-funded by OISE and EPSCoR.

    Twelve Native American students from five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota will participate in a six-week summer program over the course of three years. Each year, four students will form a cohort and participate in pre-training in the U.S. and then visit and study at the host University in Beijing, China for five weeks. All three student cohorts will focus on one unifying topic - building and testing an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled environmental monitoring system. During the course of the research training and after the project is finished, a deep and comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to assess three key aspects of the program: 1) instructional training and research experience, 2) global professional and cultural experience; and 3) student mentoring. This program will greatly benefit participating students. This is an international learning experience that may be the key highlight of student participants' academic careers, which may be especially true for Native American students, as they have less chances for performing research abroad. The program will provide participating students with unique opportunities to become globally-engaged scientists and to build their international scientific networks. There are five Tribal Colleges in the state of North Dakota that represent historic tribal nations. The recruitment of this program from these Tribal Colleges will ensure a regionally diverse student group will receive international mentoring and research-based education. In many large cities of U.S., there are environmental problems similar to Beijing, so the monitoring technology learned by participating students will provide valuable reference and an essential technology reserve. The participating students will build peer-mentoring skills and learn about the unique culture and traditions of China from Beijing, the culture center of China.

    Student participants will learn to design advanced environmental monitoring systems that integrate energy harvest and remote control, which can track all four categories of environmental contaminants including metals, radioisotopes, volatile organic contaminants, and biological contaminants. In this project, tasks for student participants include sensor developments, interface circuits designs, wireless sensor network designs for Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems to realize environmental monitoring, testing the proposed monitoring system on laboratory and field sites, and making reliability-based lifetime analyses. The proposed system is a much-needed technology for environmental decision-making that will help substantially reduce ecological and human-health threats from environmental problems, and the implemented prototype and test data will be a significant reference for the other academic researchers and industrial developers. Evaluation data collection will occur sequentially using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The primary goals of this program are to: 1) provide students with training and mentoring in international-based engineering applications that will create a positive effect in their professional and personal lives, 2) create Native American experts in environmental monitoring and protection, and 3) improve specialized environmental management in the remote areas.

- abstractText: "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is
    multi-faceted. Reading comprehension is an essential life skill, which needs to
    be assessed in middle and high school. If teachers are provided a quick, easy
    process to assess students' comprehension ability and get on-time feedback regarding
    student areas of need, they can more easily adjust instruction based on student
    needs which may impact reading abilities of struggling students and general education
    students. ACE (Adolescent Comprehension Evaluation) may also help districts to
    improve overall reading scores of students and impact the results of state standardized
    assessments. In addition, as comprehension is also essential in many careers,
    employers may be looking for a way to determine if applicants are able to comprehend
    the necessary material to perform their duties. ACE may be able to provide that
    opportunity. Lastly, the medical field is searching for a process to determine
    if patients understand the information presented to them regarding certain medicines
    or procedures. The process used in ACE may be applicable in this area. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project is currently being validated using a patent-pending, multifaceted
    set of procedures. ACE includes 60 original passages for grades six through eight
    with 10 questions for each passage.  A teacher dashboard provides immediate data
    that can be used to flexibly group students and differentiate in order to improve
    students' reading comprehension. Think Aloud protocols validate the patterned
    distractors for each of the reading comprehension questions. In what is believed
    to be the first use of brain-based technology in internal structure validation,
    ACE represents an innovation in the assessment space. The multidimensional validation
    process includes the use of fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) technology
    which allows making an evidence-based claim that the test questions are text-based
    and less influenced by background knowledge than other assessments.  This is a
    critical need in an educational landscape where student cultural, geographic,
    and socioeconomic diversity influences the outcomes of assessments. ACE uses weighted
    answers to its reading comprehension questions, to allow for partial credit.  This
    means that ACE provides a more sensitive measure of growth than other assessments.
    Each of the weighted answers corresponds to a specific error in thinking, which
    means ACE gives teachers near instant feedback that can be used for instruction,
    intervention, and student groupings.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    is to provide a platform in which the members offer their products or services
    to the network, increase their assets, and use them to reduce their debts. Each
    member of the system is a network node who is connected to the other members through
    financial links that represent debt or credit relationships. Once a transaction
    occurs between two members of a network, either inside a system or outside of
    it, the link including transaction information will be created between them. PaySpray
    owns the knowledge over all the networks supplies, demands, and transactions and
    finds the optimum way to suggest the services from members to members to close
    a cycle. Members can be individuals or companies, and services can be anything
    legal to be sold or done. A member of a cycle may be a member of multiple cycles.
    Services may exceed the amount of the owed money or be less than that, the remaining
    debt can be paid either by paying money or providing another service or entering
    into a new cycle. The object is to create a network that permits various type
    of payments, bartering and financial transactions to manage an individuals or
    organizations finances. \n\nThis I-Corps project utilizes Artificial intelligence
    on a platform that intelligently connects users for financial transactions.  Members
    may invite anyone to join their network that they have financial relationships
    with whether they are the payee  or recipient of the finances.  This process continues

    efficiency and optimize performance of the model. The research also applied machine
    learning algorithms (mainly Natural Language Processing) to extract the information
    from users, inputs and use the output of the ML model to match service and demands.
    As a future improvement, researchers will apply deep learning RNN models in order
    to detect the fraud services and demands in the app.  Currently the application
    is developed in AngularJS with MongoDB Databases and deployed on Amazon Web Service.\n\nThis

    a faster design cycle of industrial filters to meet an ever-growing demand. This
    demand stems from an accelerated industrial development in the world, leading
    to an increased need for clean air and water through the use of filtration systems.
    Industrial emissions have led to the release of significant amounts of pollutants
    and particles into the atmosphere which can lead to potential health problems
    in human societies. Additionally, water resources are becoming scarce at an alarming
    rate which calls for more effective ways of providing clean water from non-traditional
    sources including sea water and recycled water. The technology to be commercialized
    uses a mathematical technique called computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that allows
    engineers to analyze the efficiency of filters with a computational model before
    production. Additionally, using this technology allows for more design iterations
    within the product development cycle leading to a better final product. Successful
    commercialization of this technology will lead to significant improvements in
    filter design, a reduction in production costs and cleaner air and water. \n\nThis
    I-Corps project aims at exploring the potential market for implementing a CFD
    software package targeted at the filtration industry. Significant formal training,
    the need for having a deep understanding of the CFD concepts, cumbersome setup
    procedures, and lengthy computational runtime are among the burdens of implementing
    a CFD technique within the industry. These complexities limit the use of this
    critical component in the product development cycle. The technology being considered
    for commercialization is a novel algorithm which facilitates the implementation
    of a CFD study. The proposed technique will lead to shorter, easier setup of the
    computational model and faster computational runtime to obtain results. After
    receiving the initial design data, the software automatically analyzes the desired
    performance criteria. The output data are then used by the engineering team to
    improve the product and achieve higher performances. The technology is a result
    of extensive R&D work including algorithm and initial software development, and
    extensive laboratory experimentation for validation purposes.\n\nThis award reflects

    This technology will help mobile app developers do their due diligence and easily scan their apps for any legal and security issues, thereby not only protecting their brand, but also ensuring the security and privacy of end users. The technology also preserves the open-source software ecosystem, by enabling mobile app developers to proactively scan their app and identifying any inadvertent open-source license violations. Based on the reported results, app developers can either comply with the licensing terms of the software being used or switch over to a more permissive Open-Source Software (OSS).

    App stores are quickly getting crowded, with currently over 6 million apps. Therefore, app developers often rely on Open-Source Software (OSS) to reduce the development cost and quickly bring their apps to market. Unfortunately, careless use of OSS can introduce severe legal and security risks. If ignored, such risks can not only jeopardize the security and privacy of end users, but also cause high financial losses to businesses owning such apps and damage their brand. However, tracking all OSS components, their versions, and inter-dependencies can be tedious and error-prone, particularly if the OSS is imported with little to no knowledge of its provenance. This problem is exacerbated by the esoteric licensing terms of these OSS, as developers may lack awareness about the legal ramifications of their use. The PI's research team has built a fully-automated software system that analyzes mobile app binaries to detect usage of all Open-Source Software (OSS) components being used, and report associated security and legal risks.

    the transformation of the way technical writers and research teams write and edit
    technical documentation, including data dissemination reports, research proposals,

    and high levels of innovation in technical and scientific teams. The methodology,
    implemented in software, will target a broad spectrum of users, from seasoned
    technical writing teams to emerging solo practitioners; the training materials
    built into the system will be beneficial for all students and young technical
    writers who seek to develop more effective writing approaches. The market segmentation
    is broken into, in the order of market size: 1) large businesses and corporations,
    2) academia and educational institutions, 3) government agencies, 4) individuals,
    and 5) small businesses. Commercialization will require securing partnerships
    with marketers, university personnel, scholarly journals, and industry professionals,
    as well as conducting case studies and customer discovery to quantify how the
    product saves teams time, reduces stress, and delivers training materials for
    personnel. The resulting product will facilitate the development of strong professional
    manuscripts for teams of all sizes at other universities and in the industry.
    \n\nThis I-Corps project seeks to simplify and automate some of the critical obstacles
    to technical writing, thereby fostering a time-efficient writing and editing environment.
    In the current collaborative technical writing paradigm, personnel training and
    inexperience are two of the biggest obstacles to successful (in terms of acceptance
    rates) technical documentation. Teams that adopt the new writing and editing toolset
    will find it easier to train new personnel, as well as coordinate writing efforts
    across a variety of different writing styles and skills. Senior researchers will
    have more time and resources to focus on the research itself, due to the optimized
    method of personnel training or mentorship allowed by this system. Over time,
    the toolset will develop into a methodology that can be broadened to help with
    any writing discipline, from science and engineering to law or accounting. The
    toolset was born out of the needs of academic technical writing teams, which produce
    academic documentation daily. Quantification of impact is segment-dependent. Existing
    case studies show an improved success of proposal submissions by 40%, with a 60%
    increase in writing efficiency without loss of quality (in fact, with improved
    quality, as indicated by the greater success of proposal acceptance).\n\nThis

    This project will enable cohorts of students from engineering, anthropology, and other sustainability-related disciplines to collaborate and study the efficacy of sanitation and wastewater treatment technologies as well as the role of culture and local perceptions on the safe recovery of energy, nutrients, and clean water from human excreta and wastewater. Over the course of three years, a total of 18 US students will be supported to study the performance of different technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. This facility, which is co-managed by the Federal University of Minas Gerais and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais, contains pilot-scale reactors that treat real wastewater from the city of Belo Horizonte. Considered one of the most important research and professional training centers of its kind in the Americas, it is used as a test site to evaluate the effectiveness of new technologies and train wastewater system operators. In addition to broadening students' perspectives about sanitation, resource recovery, and risk within an interdisciplinary team setting, this project will also allow students to improve their intercultural abilities. The researchers will seek to recruit students that reflect our demographics as Title V Hispanic Serving Institutions, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in the sciences and engineering. Students will participate in a five-day intensive crash course on Brazilian culture and Portuguese language, led by the San Diego State University Program on Brazil, where they will learn to articulate the opinions and perspectives of people from different cultures and backgrounds. They will gain an awareness of international, interdisciplinary, and community perspectives on the role of engineering and technology in the management of water, energy, and food systems. After participating in the research experience, students will share their experiences by engaging in local outreach activities at K-12 schools in Southern California.

    The integration of water reuse and resource recovery into wastewater treatment and sanitation systems provides opportunities to simultaneously meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the challenges of choosing appropriate and sustainable technologies are just as much social as they are technical. Inadequate assumptions about local attitudes and the role of technology in development can lead to the failure of systems. Thus, there is a need to integrate studies of the efficacy of sanitation and resource recovery technologies with assessments of social and cultural factors that influence perceptions about these technologies, as well as the perceived value and risk of recovering resources from wastewater and excreta. This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will send interdisciplinary cohorts of six students each year (from Engineering, Anthropology and an interdisciplinary Sustainability Program) to Belo Horizonte, Brazil, to participate in a research experience with foreign mentorship at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Students will study the removal of emerging contaminants and characterize the risks associated with resource recovery from pilot-scale established and emerging wastewater treatment technologies at the Center for Research and Training in Sanitation (CePTS), which is co-managed by UFMG and the State Wastewater Company of Minas Gerais. Students will also investigate perceived values and risks through ethnographic research with community members and local stakeholders in the water and wastewater sector. The results of this research will support a new and growing field of interdisciplinary scientific literature on the topic of water, culture, and sustainability.

    IRES project will support US students and provide international education, training
    and research in marine geochemistry and carbon cycling in a tropical estuary (Douala
    Estuary) in the Atlantic coast of Cameroon, West Africa. During this study, faculty
    and students from the University of Delaware, a PhD granting institution and Fort
    Hays State University, a non-PhD granting institution will partner with faculty
    and students from the University of Douala and the University of Yaound? 1in Cameroon.
    Over the next three years, 9 undergraduates and 3 MS students will travel to Cameroon
    to conduct hands-on, field-based research that is focused on investigating the
    effects of agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities on carbon
    cycling in the Douala Estuary. The objectives are to (1) document pollution in
    the water column and sediments and (2) assess if and how the human activities
    and pollution affect carbon dioxide production in water column and sediments.
    Data acquired by the students will provide important information to assess the
    role of the Douala Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable information
    to model the movement of carbon at the local, regional and even global scale.\n\nThis
    IRES project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity
    to conduct faculty mentored, hands-on research in an apprenticeship-type model.
    Different aspects of the project will form the basis of undergraduate research

    The results of the students' projects will provide scientific input that will
    be useful for designing sustainable management programs for the use and protection

    carbon cycle. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program identified carbon contributions
    from estuaries to the atmosphere as a critical area for research. Much research
    on carbon cycling has been conducted in estuaries in temperate regions. To date,
    there are no studies of carbon cycling in tropical estuaries of Africa and even
    less is known about how agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping activities
    polluting theses estuaries affect the carbon cycle. Few estuarine studies are
    based in Africa, despite the high human population along the coast and extensive
    human alteration of estuarine ecosystems. The US Carbon Cycle Research Program
    identified carbon sources and fluxes to and from estuaries as a critical area
    for research because estuaries link the terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric carbon
    reservoirs. Yet, the role in local, regional or even global carbon cycling from
    tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa which receive far greater amounts of
    organic carbon and pollutants compared to temperate and high latitude estuaries
    is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, for six weeks and over a three-year period,
    US students and their Cameroonian peers will conduct field based research to elucidate
    how anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urbanization, industrial and shipping)
    that pollute the Douala Estuary with nutrients (e.g., nitrates) and metals (Cadmium)
    affect carbon cycling in the water column and sediments. The anticipated results
    of this project will provide important information to assess the role of the Douala
    Estuary in carbon cycling and provide valuable data for carbon cycling modelling
    at the local, regional and even global scale. Students will test the hypothesis

    The first stars, galaxies and black holes burst into existence only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, bringing light to the cosmos and setting in motion processes that built the Universe as we see it today. Many mysteries remain about these early epochs, but not for too much longer: new and upcoming facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and the James Webb Space Telescope are optimized to revolutionize our understanding of this time period, known as "Cosmic Dawn." The Cosmic Dawn Center of Excellence (DAWN, established 2018), an international research center in Copenhagen, Denmark, brings together scholars whose interests span a broad range of observational and theoretical inquiries into Cosmic Dawn. Their expertise, together with Copenhagen's beautiful and enriching setting, make DAWN an ideal host for budding US scholars. We will create the DAWN-IRES Scholars Program to empower future generations of US scientists through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of visiting Copenhagen to immerse themselves into this vibrant international research center. The DAWN-IRES scholars will join a cohort of 7 student researchers in a stimulating 10-week science program that merges research using next-generation telescopes with life in a thousand-year-old city. The program's structure will encourage students to build learning communities within their cohorts, equipping them with practical research and communication skills. At the same time, the international exposure and access to cutting-edge resources will help maintain US leadership within the global astronomical community.

    Students will lead observational and/or theoretical projects that contribute towards understanding some of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics today: What caused the reionization of the Universe?  How do the first, massive galaxies form?  What is the origin of galaxy scaling relations? What quenches star formation in massive galaxies?  Over the next decade, the center's mission is to develop and test a physical model explaining the key processes responsible for the assembly of the earliest galaxies through to the present day. The DAWN-IRES Scholars will join this thriving international research network, bridging the world class research performed by the US-based associate faculty coordinating this program with the DAWN permanent faculty and the local program coordinator.  The key learning goals of this international research experience include: (1) building a learning community to stimulate personal and academic growth, (2) developing effective scientific communication skills, and (3) performing globally competitive research addressing an open question in astrophysics.

    The DAWN-IRES program is primarily designed to enhance the progress of science through a unique global educational training experience for a diverse cohort of US students.  The themes defining the broader impact of the program include diversity, training, dissemination, and community.  Through extensive proactive recruitment strategies (direct contact with faculty at minority-serving institutions, leveraging social media, widely circulating flyers, local announcements in STEM courses, and more), the PI will assemble diverse groups of scholars to stimulate excellence and innovation.  The program incorporates a wide range of professional development activities that are focused on advancing scientific communication skills (e.g., weekly seminars, hack days, oral presentations abroad and stateside).  The students will also build professional research toolkits, including learning programming, data analysis and presentation techniques.  Dissemination of research will occur through the DAWN-IRES Scholars Symposium at the end of each summer in Copenhagen, together with a presentation at the students' local institutions and the national American Astronomical Society meeting.  Working with the Center for Excellence in Teaching at UConn, the assessment strategy of DAWN-IRES will be tailored to the learning goals of the program.

    Fungal infection of plants is an ongoing major threat to human agriculture, thus stressing the importance of the research proposed in this project. The fungal pathogens studied in the US lab of the PI and the two labs in Germany, serve as models for understanding basic mechanisms of infections, but also for understanding host specificity and emerging infectious disease through host shifts. It is expected to gain alternative perspectives to address these research themes by the collaborative approaches. This IRES project provides an opportunity to 7 students each year to participate in the exchange. Although all three labs work with fungi, each has its own areas of expertise and each provides different approaches for conducting research. Each summer, a joint meeting will take place with all participants and PIs to discuss and present the ongoing projects in a unified group setting, alternating each year in Bochum or in Aachen, Germany.  This project is of particular importance because it may lead to the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases. Also, this project will allow active participation by students and help them develop skills in experimental design, and broaden participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (especially, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    The unifying research theme for this proposal is host/pathogen interaction, including components of virulence and overall fitness of the pathogen. This project requires, and will benefit from, training in the two German labs, rather than having all students work in the same lab. First, the collaboration with two labs spreads the responsibility of the host labs and allows for more students (i.e., up to 7) to participate each year in the exchange. It is expected that the strong impact of these collaborative research/training exchanges will be in the longer-term appreciation of cultural differences and alternative approaches to research questions. The broader investigation of fungal/host interactions will benefit from this varied, collaborative approach by streamlining exchange of ideas and expertise. The proposed effector and protein interaction studies will be used by a wide community of scientists interested in basic fungal biology, host-parasite interactions, fungal evolution, and the development of new methods for protecting agricultural crop plants from fungal diseases and could lead to a better understanding of the basic infection mechanisms and disease process of obligate plant-parasitic fungi. Educational opportunities for students will be provided to actively participate in fungal genetics, transcriptomics and bio-informatics research, to learn fluorescence and electron microscopy techniques, to develop skills in experimental design, and will broaden the participation in basic science by underrepresented groups (specifically, African-Americans, women, and Appalachian students).

    Center for Selective Carbon - Hydrogen (C-H) Functionalization (CCHF) will coordinate and support a highly collaborative international exchange program with sites in Japan, South Korea and Germany. During the exchanges, students will participate in collaborative projects directed towards developing new approaches to making molecules in a streamlined and sustainable way. These new approaches will have impact on modern medicine and manufacturing, including drug discovery and materials science. This proposal builds upon a previous NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) program and provides the exciting opportunity to capitalize on the collaborative bonds already established to grow a truly diverse and globally prepared next generation of scientists that benefit from an integrated and successful global research collective. The overarching scientific theme that brings these international teams together is C-H functionalization, a science that is at the leading edge of academic chemical research.

    The aim of this International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) proposal is to establish a vibrant training environment for collaborative global research in the general field of C?H functionalization. This will be achieved by means of a productive international research collaborative, the Global Institute for C-H Functionalization (GICHF).  This program will involve student exchanges and collaborations between the CCHF and three major international centers in the general field of C-H functionalization.  These centers are the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI)-funded Institute for Transformative Bio-Molecule (WPI-ITbM) at Nagoya University, Japan, the Institutes for Basic Sciences-funded Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon Functionalizations (IBS-CF) at KAIST, South Korea, and the Photocatalysis Center based at the University of Regensburg, Germany.  Each year a cohort of CCHF students, consisting of 3 graduate and 5 undergraduate students will perform 8-12 week exchanges between May-August with the international partners. The CCHF will also host international students, funded by the international partners, to ensure reciprocity in the collaborative exchanges.  Programming throughout the year will be in place to prepare the students for the research exchanges and to ensure they make the most of these experiences. The experience will include a GICHF annual meeting, which will be hosted, on a rotating basis, at one of our international partners. The annual meeting will serve as an opportunity to bring together the entire student cohort as well as faculty from the United States, for a week-long brainstorming, community building, and educational event with our international partners.

    This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

    International Research and Professional Development Experience for Students on the Ecology and Conservation of Wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar

    The proposed research and professional development program will take place in Madagascar, one of the highest priority biodiversity hotspots in the world, with levels of endemism unmatched by any other country. The research goal of this program is to characterize the status of Nosy Be Island's endangered and charismatic terrestrial and marine species and identify the threats driving their declines. The research team of local and international researchers will train undergraduate students from the US and Madagascar to use a variety of wildlife research methods and social science surveys. Using these acquired skills, students will generate critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial species, including primates (lemurs), sea turtles, and dolphins. During this 3-year project students will, along with mentor, develop an understanding of the drivers of wildlife declines and design sustainable programs to protect them.  Science-based management is particularly important in Madagascar because terrestrial and marine ecosystems are experiencing alarming rates of biodiversity loss and habitat destruction in the face of food security challenges to local human populations. This project will create opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from both countries to adapt field methods to research questions in the context of generating cost-effective data to achieve sustainable conservation goals. Most importantly, this program will produce cohorts of highly trained scientists in the field of conservation biology with a deep understanding of real-world challenges.

    Generating baseline ecological data on rare and charismatic endangered species is critical for conservation and wildlife management, particularly in data-poor areas where conflicts between human activities and biodiversity are acute. All research projects will address at least one of three objectives: (1) assess the critical habitats and density trends of six endangered flagship species, including three lemurs, one species of cetacean and one species of sea turtle, (2) investigate the environmental drivers of their abundance and their decline, and (3) assess the impact of potential mitigation measures. Each cohort of students (6 students per year) will base their research questions on the findings of previous cohorts, enabling us to develop a comprehensive understanding of the causes of decline and measures to preserve Nosy Be's wildlife. This research and professional development program has four stages: 1) pre-field training at Florida International University, 2) data collection in Madagascar, 3) data-analysis and reporting at FIU and 4) future-cohort input and supervision where students will share their experiences and support new cohorts. During field activities, students will be trained to 1) use standard methods to rapidly assess the conservation status of endangered species in the field and 2) use a combination of field and social science survey methods to conduct animal assessments. During class activities students will be trained to 1) write research proposals and field protocols, 2) use advanced statistical methods to analyze field data, 3) write technical and non-technical publications, 4) do oral presentations of their research, and 5) collaborate and mentor other students. Ultimately, this research program will provide critical data on the conservation status of endangered marine and terrestrial wildlife in Nosy Be, Madagascar, and will provide students with key research and conservation skills.

    and education partnership between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University
    of Bologna (UniBo) in Italy.  The proposed work is envisioned to improve the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities and their caregivers, transform the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    care to data-based diagnosis and model-based design and 3D-printing, and provide
    an international research experience to students. The goal of this collaboration
    is to provide a high-quality international research experience to University of
    Michigan students to increase student diversity and retention and advance students'
    ability in and knowledge of culture, globalization, leadership, teamwork, and
    communication. The key intellectual merit of this collaboration is in the model-based
    design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized assistive devices. The project
    will utilize technical knowledge gained from University of Michigan and will improve
    individualized assistive devices such as the knee-ankle-foot orthosis, a brace
    that helps people with leg instabilities to walk. \n\nThe scientific objective
    of this award is to establish an international research and education partnership
    between the University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Bologna (UniBo) in
    Italy on the model-based design, 3D-printing, and evaluation of individualized
    assistive devices (IADs). The project is focused on the advancements in 3D-printing
    and wearable sensors that enable the design and fabrication of assistive devices
    for individual needs.  Patient-specific biomechanical models will be developed
    to analyze the motions and forces associated with the daily activities of a patient.
    For example, from models of patient-specific knee joint motion, compliant 3D-printed
    knee joints will be analyzed and designed to improve the function of individual
    assistive devices.  Combined metal 3D-printing, precision machining, and mechanical
    testing will be used to fabricate and test the compliant knee joint.  Finally,
    the knee-ankle-foot-orthosis devices fabricated by conventional and 3D-printing
    methods will be evaluated on patients in clinic and during daily activities. Specifically,
    this project aims to design, fabricate, and evaluate an individualized knee-ankle-foot-orthosis
    (KAFO) with metal and plastic 3D-printed parts. Students will study four research
    topics related to the KAFO: (1) biomechanical quantification of activities and
    lifestyles of KAFO patients, (2) analysis and design of a patient-specific compliant
    knee joint, (3) manufacturing of compliant knee joint, and (4) evaluation of the
    patient-specific KAFO.\n\nThe broader impact of the proposed work in design, 3D-printing,
    and evaluation of personalized assistive devices is to re-establish the quality-of-life
    of people with disabilities by restoring normal joint motion and function. Personalized
    assistive devices with good fit and quick delivery can greatly benefit patients
    as well as their caregivers. Further, tailoring the function of these devices
    to the patient improves their ability to ambulate and reduces the chances of reinjury.
    The transformative aspects of this project are the mass production of custom assistive
    devices and the long-term monitoring of the gait and mobility of assistive device
    users for physical and psychological diagnosis and prevention of fall and other
    accidents. The knowledge and biomechanical models can improve the design practice
    and evaluation of the efficacy of a broad range of assistive devices.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

- abstractText: "In much of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa, people lack safe
    drinking water and adequate sanitation. Although there have been a number of efforts
    to develop low-cost, efficient methods to treat water and wastewater, many of
    them fail in practice due to the lack of understanding of social and economic
    factors, and the lack of community engagement. This project will engage fifteen
    (15) IRES participants and three (3) graduate assistants from STEM, STEM education,
    public health and social sciences in carrying out research to develop, test and
    implement the technologies, such as biosand filters and decentralized sanitation
    systems, while uncovering and addressing social factors that limit their use in
    the field. The project will take place in collaboration with students and faculty
    at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), as well as teachers
    and pupils in a local secondary school in Kumasi, Ghana.  US students will experience
    real on-the-ground water and sanitation situations that will enhance their research
    skills as they develop the global competence needed to work effectively in developing
    countries.  Specific objectives are to: 1) increase the number of US students
    engaging in global water and sanitation research, 2) enhance student understanding
    of the complexity of water and sanitation challenges and increase their global
    competency, 3) engage secondary school teachers and pupils in Ghana in authentic
    science and participatory action research, and 4) develop strong collaborations
    between USF and KNUST for water and sanitation research and education.\n\nThe
    participating research teams will advance research and development of: 1) biosand
    filters that simultaneously address infectious disease and dental/skeletal health
    risks that are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, and 2) decentralized ecological
    sanitation technologies, such as constructed wetlands, urine diverting dry toilets
    and biodigesters, which recover valuable resources (water, nutrients, energy)
    from human wastes.  Each team will work on technology development, appropriate
    financing mechanisms and effective behavioral and educational approaches to improve
    WASH practices. \n\nIRES participants will directly experience WASH research in
    the geopolitical, socioeconomic and cultural context of Ghana.  These experiences
    will enhance their understanding of WASH challenges and build their global competency.
    \ We will recruit female and underrepresented minority students through programs
    and clubs that emphasize diversity, community colleges and minority serving institutions.
    \ Extensive professional development and mentoring programs are planned for IRES
    participants.  Results will be integrated into courses taught by the PIs and outreach
    to the Tampa Bay community, K12 science teachers and students.  The project will
    strengthen the partnership between USF and KNUST and create opportunities for
    future collaborations, particularly in WASH research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's

- abstractText: "Materials scientists from the University of Vermont will partner
    with engineers and physicists at Yamagata University (Japan) for an IRES program
    that will foster and nurture a new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists.
    At the end of the program participants will be equipped with key experimental
    skills and background tailored for the specific needs of organic electronics research
    and technology that bridge physical chemistry, chemical engineering, and condensed
    matter physics. Three PhDs and twelve undergraduate US students will spend ten
    weeks working in teams with the Japanese mentors and their students on interdisciplinary
    projects specifically designed to leverage the ongoing collaboration on small
    molecules electronics between the US and Japanese participants. The students will
    learn specific experimental techniques while immersed in a new, culturally -distinct
    collaborative environment. They will gain unprecedented access to fabrication
    and characterization techniques inaccessible at their home institution. Students
    will undergo a two-week intensive language training specifically focused on laboratory
    work communication and become part of the cultural immersion activities at Yamagata
    University. The group also benefits from the contribution of a school of education
    faculty member that will conduct assessment activities resulting in best practices
    recommendations for a Global Scientist certificate offering at the University
    of Vermont.  A semester -long recruitment plan will focus on women and minorities
    from small or HBCU colleges in the northeastern United States.\n\nFor the past
    ten years, synthetic chemistry efforts that produced soluble derivatives of small
    molecule semiconductors led to macroscopically-ordered crystalline thin films
    and scalable, cost-effective roll-to-roll processing techniques that promise a
    future where flexible, bio-integrated, or disposable electronics may play a significant
    role in our everyday lives. Though these advances have been incredibly significant,
    the performance metrics of organic semiconductor-based transistors, LEDs, and
    solar cells are still far behind (to varying degrees) their crystalline inorganic
    counterparts.  The scientific and engineering communities are at a turning point
    where the next major step forward can only be realized with novel interdisciplinary
    approaches based on a fundamental understanding of the electronic and excitonic
    properties. \nThe Vermont -Yamagata IRES partnership will foster and nurture a
    new generation of interdisciplinary materials scientists, that will become experts
    ready to tackle the grand challenges of small molecule electronics. The underlying
    scientific theme of the student projects investigates correlations between long-range
    order, the nature of intermolecular interactions, and electronic properties in
    small molecule families. It seeks ways of exploiting these correlations towards
    establishing design rules for optimization of electronic and excitonic properties
    of small molecule thin films. Such design rules lead to avenues for affordable,
    sustainable, organic device platforms for a variety of applications including
    photovoltaics, flexible electronics, and bio-interfacing. The proposed experimental
    work will also trigger theoretical questions related to bridging the quantum chemistry
    body of knowledge with condensed matter approaches that take into account long
    range interactions, thus building an interdisciplinary model for excitonic and
    charge carrier behavior in these systems.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory
    mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    Nanoscience is one of the most exciting areas of modern research stretching across the whole spectrum of science including: physics, engineering, chemistry, medicine and health. Computational Nanoscience addresses the challenges of this rapidly evolving field by using novel computational methods to tackle practical problems.

    The main objective of this project is to create international research opportunity for students and immerse them in creative computational nanoscience projects. Through the international research experience,  students will become part of a new generation of computational scientists modeling outstanding problems in materials science, physics and chemistry as researchers in industry, academia, and government labs. To achieve this, students will be trained in both theoretical and practical aspects of computational modeling, and further their professional development through participation in computational projects in an international research environment. The international research framework will allow students to be practitioners and innovators in computational modeling by educating them in both fundamentals (mathematics, physics, computational tools, material science and computer science) and applications.  The students will have opportunity to do research in Japan's leading research center (Tsukuba Science City), world renowned National Lab (RIKEN) and best university (University of Tokyo) and will have access to the world's best supercomputers. In addition, the students will be exposed to Japan's multifaceted culture, traditions, history and natural beauty.

    The proposed research presents broad training opportunities for students overarching physics, electrical engineering, material science, quantum mechanical simulations, high performance computing, and novel computational algorithms. The proposed international collaboration
    will provide an unparalleled research environment for students, exposing them to the forefront of scientific challenges and technological innovations from an international podium. The projects will encourage the participation of underrepresented groups by leveraging the Vanderbilt-Fisk bridge program and by actively recruiting minority students. The students will also be introduced into the
    rich culture and history of Japan. The host Japanese groups will also likely to benefit not only from the research outcomes but through the international cultural exchange and experience.

    The US students will pursue time-dependent simulations of electron and ion dynamics in nanomaterials using novel atomistic quantum mechanical approaches. These investigations will be frontier applications of time-dependent first-principles quantum mechanical calculations to describe interaction of electromagnetic fields and matter, electron transport and scattering and physics of ultracold atoms. The results of these simulations will be valuable in evaluating the experiments probing new frontiers of material science.

    In collaboration with Japanese research groups, researchers from VU have developed a linear scaling atomistic approach to simulate the time-dependent behavior of molecules, solids, and nanostructures in time-dependent external fields. The approach allows for the simulation of electron and ion dynamics in systems containing thousands of atoms, incorporating the effect of electromagnetic fields by coupling the time-dependent Maxwell and Schrodinger equations. The participating students will use these computer simulations tools to study various systems, including high harmonics generation in solids, interaction of laser pulses and 2D materials, ionization and fragmentation of molecules by circularly polarized light, low energy scattering of electrons and biomolecules, and other interesting cases. The students will also develop and test novel computational approaches to increase the speed and accuracy of quantum simulations.

    research experience related to battery-less embedded systems in future Internet
    of Things (IoT) in China, which has one of the world's largest electronic industry
    and market. The project will select five (5) graduate students and two (2) undergraduate
    students nation-wide each year and support them to visit Tsinghua University (THU)
    over a period of eight (8) weeks. \n\nThe vision of IoT is to embed small computers
    into objects around our daily life to improve our economy and societal well-being.
    It is estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) will consist of almost 50 billion
    objects by 2020. However, one of the biggest challenges is how to power these
    billions of embedded devices since batteries need frequent recharging and impose
    health and environmental concerns. In this project, the students will work with
    renowned research groups at THU to develop future IoT sensors that can reply on
    energy harvested from ambient environment sources, such as solar energy, radio
    frequency energy, kinetic energy, and thermal energy. Since ambient energy is
    intrinsically intermittent, the students will conduct research on nano-scale device,
    circuits, system, and software to realize computer systems that can work with
    intermittent energy supply. Such systems will dramatically improve our capability
    of collecting data while reducing the maintenance costs. Potential applications
    include smart healthcare, smart building and infrastructure monitoring, smart
    environmental monitoring, etc. This IRES project will not only offer U.S. students
    an opportunity to work in one of the best engineering research universities in
    China, but also fully immerse them in a foreign environment and improve their
    talents in working with a global team. \n\nThe project contains well-planned recruitment,
    preparation, mentoring and post-trip activities. The proposed research targets
    at nano-scale device, circuits, system, and software issues in battery-less embedded
    systems that need to be addressed urgently. The first project aims to develop
    fast, energy efficient, and uniform write operations for nano-scale memory device,
    which is critical to tolerate intermittency of harvested energy. The project addresses
    a fundamental inconsistency issue when the NVP is interacting with external volatile
    peripheral devices, which is one of the most imminent roadblocks towards wide
    application of NVPs. \nThe second project addresses a fundamental inconsistency
    issue when the battery-less device is collecting data and communicating with external
    devices. The project aims to develop efficient and accurate binarized neural network
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    nonvolatile IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    \n The third project aims to develop efficient and accurate artificial intelligence
    for individual ultraviolet (UV) exposure pattern recognition system running on
    battery-less IoT platform, which could be generalized to many other applications.
    It can be anticipated that with the close interaction with THU and the Beijing
    Innovation Center for Future Chips, the breakthroughs made from these projects
    can have a direct impact on future IoT market.\n\nThe project will enable U.S.
    students to conduct high-quality research on realizing battery-less embedded systems,
    in collaboration with their faculty mentors in THU. Such experiences expose U.S.
    students to the international research community at a critical early stage in
    their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S.
    students will gain extensive experience on the\nresearch of embedded computer
    systems, on the culture of China, and on performing and collaborating in an international
    environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community
    through the personal social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube, Web2.0
    based forum, carefully integrated activities such as research for undergraduate
    students, minorities and underrepresented groups, as well as outreach events for
    local K-12 schools.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The fundamental goals of this proposal are increasing the diversity of students studying environmental science and training the next generation of global scientists. US students will work in collaborative teams with scientists from UMBC and the Bahamas to study the critically endangered Bahama Oriole. Six students per year will work with mentors doing international research in the Bahamas, followed by data analysis and presentation back at UMBC. These projects will enable students to develop deep understanding of a range of topics in environmental science related to island ecosystems, extinction and climate dynamics. Island ecosystems have always been vulnerable to human impacts, and many island species are endangered or have become extinct. The islands of the Caribbean represent a biodiversity hotspot that is acutely threatened by climate variations. The Caribbean is home to fifteen endangered songbird species, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi). The proposed student research experience is a collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) and The Bahamas National Trust (BNT) to determine the status of the Bahama Oriole and to understand how habitat and climate change may affect it.

    In the current global extinction crisis, islands are especially vulnerable, and most endangered and extinct avian species are (or were) island species. The Bahama Oriole is now restricted to Andros, having been extirpated from Abaco in the 1990s. The likely threats facing the Bahama Oriole are typical for island species, ranging from introduced predators to anthropogenic habitat change. The impacts of climate change on endemic species in the Caribbean may be especially intense drying and warming are altering fire regimes while rising sea levels and increased hurricane intensity are causing forest mortality. The proposed student research projects address the full scope of these issues facing this critically endangered songbird. Teams of Bahamian and US mentors will together advise undergraduate students on a series of independent research projects. One UMBC PhD student will be continually on-site in the Bahamas to help mentor the students. Student projects will teach the students skills that can be applied in a range of STEM careers. Project topics include 1) population ecology (e.g., estimating population size), 2) remote sensing (e.g., effects of climate change on pine habitat), and 3) predation (e.g., radio tracking to study annual survival). Recently, the research team conducted two pilot trips with diverse teams of students from UMBC and The Bahamas. These student-led efforts confirmed the feasibility of these projects and demonstrated how little is known about the Bahama Oriole.

    Human activities have dramatically altered natural ecosystems, causing the sixth mass extinction event of our planet's history. To curb this unprecedented loss of biological diversity, it is critical to understand how organisms respond to and persist in such rapidly-changing environments. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will explore how natural populations survive the challenges of their natural environment, and then leverage this understanding to determine how the same populations respond to novel human-mediated changes. This IRES project, therefore, will provide insights needed to slow the current, unprecedented loss of biodiversity.

    This IRES project will train cohorts of 10 undergraduate students, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities), for a period of six weeks each year in field research and conservation science in the remote Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands serve as an ideal setting for this IRES project, as the archipelago is composed of dynamic ecosystems where organisms face constantly-changing conditions caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. An international team from the University of Miami and local non-government organizations will lead the program, offering diverse perspectives and unique expertise to create a thriving environment for student mentorship. The major goal is for students to first leverage natural systems by executing group experiments that explore how populations meet the challenges of their natural environment. Students will then expand on this understanding of natural systems by developing independent projects to test how the same populations respond to human-mediated disturbances. A follow-up course in the US will provide additional training and career development, with the goal of publishing the student projects. The result is an IRES program where a diverse, international team will equip the next generation of scientists with a more global perspective to tackle our planet's most pressing challenges.

    This IRES project has two major broader impacts. First, this project will train undergraduate students in international research and conservation, targeting those underrepresented in STEM (i.e., women and minorities). This IRES project will therefore tackle the lack of diversity in STEM, and provide international experience that is critical for preparing students to compete in a global market. Second, this IRES project will help establish conservation initiatives in a biodiversity hotspot. The conservation initiative includes students working with local stakeholders in collecting field data and conducting outreach to empower local communities in establishing sustainable practices. By collecting baseline data, students involved in this IRES project will help in the establishment of an ambitious conservation area. This IRES project, therefore, addresses a fundamental question in Biology, while providing students with experience in initiating impactful conservation programs.

    The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to enable the commercialization of the carbon dots technology, with the initial focus on uses in high-performance sensors for water and food analyses and in imaging techniques for the early detection of cancers and other biomedical applications. Carbon dots have been developed as nontoxic and environmentally benign alternatives to the commercially available semiconductor quantum dots, which are nanomaterials of excellent optical properties but mostly containing highly toxic heavy metals in order to achieve the desired properties and performance levels. With similarly excellent properties and high performance, carbon dots as carbon-based nanomaterials can be produced from abundant and environmentally friendly precursors. They are benign and nontoxic.  Because of the low-cost nature, the carbon dots technology is also expected to have broader applications beyond the initial focus for many other societal needs.

    This I-Corps project assesses the market potential and the likely customer base for a carbon dots technology. Carbon dots have emerged as a rapidly advancing and expanding field of research and development. Under the umbrella of the carbon dots technology, significant applications in a number of technological areas have been explored, including carbon dots as extremely sensitive, yet benign and nontoxic, optical probes, potent photocatalysts, photodynamic agents for therapy and other purposes, antibacterial and antiviral agents, and materials and components in various renewable energy and energy conversion devices. The focus of this project is on the technology for imaging and sensing to take advantage of the most important and uniquely advantageous characteristics and properties of carbon dots, specifically on several high-value uses for immediate commercial development.

    Nontechnical Abstract
    Our goal is to train a cohort of early-stage chemistry and chemical engineering graduate students to the connecting M3 cycle consisting of synthesis (Make), innovative measurements (Measure) and system modeling and sustainable operation (Model), in the context of applied chemistry in Germany. This M3 cycle is critically important in modern chemistry as it represents the most effective way to achieve rapid advances in chemical synthesis and the understanding of chemical transformations, yet this cycle is not broadly implemented in the U.S. chemical science curriculum. The proposed educational excursion will train students to better understand the interrelationship between academia and industry, as well as intercultural differences that they will encounter in a global economy. We aim to use this educational approach as an attractor to recruit highly motivated doctoral students who wish to specialize in innovative measurements, while helping them connect to the broader concept of the M3 cycle, and so contribute to society as interdisciplinary and intercultural ambassadors. There is an intertwined need in chemistry education: (i) to train the next generation experts in advanced and new chemical measurement technology, and (ii) to teach them how to conduct, view and present their specialized and novel measurement methods in the context of problems of utmost interest to chemistry, at the nexus of science discovery and societal needs. Graduate students who have carried out their studies at the M3 interface will undoubtedly think differently as leaders in their field and have a better understanding to connect to the German chemistry landscape. The successes of the M3 educational experience is expected to help inform the development of new courses and emphases for chemistry graduate programs.

    Technical Abstract
    Expert groups in advanced magnetic resonance at University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB) (Han), University of California-Berkeley (UCB)(Reimer), University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA)(Bouchard) and the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH)in Aachen, Germany (Blümich) joined together to pool their advanced analytical tools to work on integrated problem-solving in a three-way M3 cycle, in synergistic collaboration with chemistry and engineering colleagues to concentrate their efforts on the training of a cohort of graduate students. Several research groups at the RWTH Aachen University are ideal partners to pursue this educational endeavor, not only because the RWTH is ranked #1 in forging chemistry-engineering partnerships, but also because there are strong existing multi-PI collaborations between the UCLA/UCSB/UCB and RWTH PIs that the IRES fellows can immerse themselves in. A cohort of 5-7 graduate students per year will be selected and recruited in the first year of their doctoral studies, with the goal to integrate their research and training in the M3 cycle throughout their entire graduate career with leveraging support and collaborative backing. These select students will be prepared pre-departure with weekly online sessions on the German language and culture. The IRES cohort will gather at UCSB for an orientation conference ahead of their departure and travel to Aachen in the summer following the first year of their doctoral studies. The expected outcome is that the graduate students have gained hands-on experience on how to accelerate the discovery and triaging of chemical, materials and system parameters and how to design reaction pathways given a set of starting chemicals. This learning process and evolution will be shared at an annual workshop involving current and past IRES fellows. The effectiveness of the IRES fellows program will be evaluated, and their professional connection within the cohort and the collaborators maintained through social media.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program, organized by Professors Ali Mehrizi-Sani and Chen-Ching Liu from Washington State University (WSU), in collaboration with Prof. Stephen McArthur and his colleagues from the University of Strathclyde (Scotland), provides six US students with the opportunity to participate in the diverse smart grid research atmosphere at one of leading, most highly funded, and most entrepreneurial European universities. This program is developed out of a 20-year collaborative relationship between WSU and the University of Strathclyde. The students will undertake projects to address challenges in renewable energy integration. Ultimately, the research performed in this program will help increase the utilization of distributed renewable energy resources in the power system of the future, the smart grid. This research benefits our society and environment by (i) increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, (ii) increasing career interest in power system and the smart grid, and (iii) improving the quality and quantity of the power engineering workforce in the United States. These benefits directly translate into a more capable and larger student intake that can address the workforce shortage problem; it also helps the transition to a modern power grid with higher efficiency, reliability, and resiliency.

    The students in this program will perform research relevant to smart grid and the electric power system. Electrical power is critical to the U.S. economy. However, most of the current U.S. electric infrastructure is outdated. What exacerbates this problem is that this infrastructure still runs mainly on legacy control, monitoring, and protection systems that may not realize its full potential. While environmental concerns and energy independence recommend utilizing renewable resources in the power system, one of the U.S. grand energy challenges remains to integrate large amounts of renewable energy. These challenges also add to the difficulty of enforcing resiliency of the power system to major disturbances and events. The research to be undertaken in this project seeks to address this challenge through activities on (i) accurate and fast controllers for integration of renewables, (ii) resilient distribution systems, and (iii) and system-agnostic controls of microgrid resources. Compared to the United States, many European countries have a more mature experience in the utilization of renewable energy resources. The University of Strathclyde maintains one of the largest power programs in Europe and, as a prime example of an institution with proven track record in research and industry collaboration, is an ideal partner in this project that combines an international research experience for students with outstanding research capacity.

    (XC and OMA)Directorates.\n\nPart 1\nNanofibers exhibit unique properties that
    have stimulated a massive effort in nanofibers research to address key challenges
    in high performance filtration, battery separators, wound healing, composites,
    blood vessel and tissue engineering, electrochemical sensing, smart textiles,
    drug delivery, and catalysis. Some recent examples include: Dermtreat's nanofibrous
    Rivelin patch for innovative treatment of mucosal diseases and DuPont's nanofiber-based
    EnergainT battery separator, which boosts up to 30% power of Li-ion batteries,
    just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2
    billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable
    production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures,
    and desirable properties.\nUndergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds
    from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy
    University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber
    science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers
    by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process.
    ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce
    or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing
    the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain
    critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences
    expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work
    at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries,
    joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse
    international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this
    project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials
    domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high
    level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.\n\nPart 2\nThis
    project brings the ongoing collaborations to a higher level and establishes new
    collaborations in the emerging area of fabrication and application of nanofiber
    materials and structures with Technical University of Liberec (TUL, Czech Republic,
    a leading academic center in nanofiber research), Lodz U of Technology (UT-Lodz,
    Poland, a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis), and  Aalto University (Finland,
    the #1 Finnish University with strong idea-to-industry programs in nanoscience
    and engineering). At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham
    (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo
    will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge
    research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier
    European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes
    dissemination activities. \nIRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield
    Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical
    phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional
    DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply
    the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous
    catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will
    have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign
    sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities
    to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and
    excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft
    skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice
    of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber
    materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures
    with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner,
    and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders,
    and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain,
    and for the relevant fields.\nIRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public,
    other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials
    Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts
    by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station. All participants will mutually benefit
    through a growing network of advanced research and training facilities. This project
    will enable, in a long-term perspective, a broader synergistic coupling between
    domestic and international research groups by bringing new collaborators and catalyzing
    the continuation of international student exchanges.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using

- abstractText: "This project will send 3 cohorts of 5 students per year for 10 weeks
    each to conduct research at the University of Bamberg, Germany.  The University
    of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and
    the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise
    levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors
    throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help
    decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex
    interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes
    from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by
    city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up
    and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more
    efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious
    software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.
    \ \nOur research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such
    a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information
    while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people
    who might spy on them through their data.  Researchers will be implementing and
    testing their work in the Living Lab Bamberg in Germany to validate the effectiveness
    of our security systems.  It is expected that this work will result in safer,
    more intelligent smart cities with the potential to improve energy efficiency,
    communication, transportation, and public health.\n\nThis project will address
    several scientific challenges in the security and privacy of smart cities. The
    site at the University of Bamberg was chosen due to the smart city living laboratory
    that the university operates on both the campus and city.  The researchers will
    address the following three scientific challenges:  \ni) Utilization of data from
    untrusted sources is critical because many of the data sources in a smart city
    are the smart phones of users who can intentionally manipulate data or who might
    have malware on their phone that is strategically manipulating data.  Students
    will build defense mechanisms using a combination of game theory and machine learning.
    \nii) Privacy of users is critical to the adoption of crowd sensing for use in
    a smart city and to prevent the abuse of the system by users and administrators
    alike.  Students will build privacy-enhancing technologies that use realistically
    generated cover traffic to obfuscate user data and cyber-physical correlation
    to enable privacy-preserving audits of the data collected by the city. \niii)
    \  Secure incentives help to protect the deployers of tasks from malicious users
    that are seeking to optimize their gain without contributing to the system.  To
    ensure that malicious users do not exploit the incentive system, students will
    create spatio-temporal models of context information that detect if a user was
    actually at the location at the time they reported they were when contributing
    information.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed
    worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit
    and broader impacts review criteria."

    accelerate and streamline the process that leads to chemical innovation -- an
    important factor in economic and technological advancement -- and thus result
    in an improved return on public and private investments. The project also addresses
    corresponding questions of training and workforce development needed in chemistry,
    thus insuring the US's international competitiveness. \n\nThe mission of this
    project is to assert the role of big data research in the chemical domain, i.e.,
    to promote, enable, and advance the ideas of data-driven discovery and rational
    design. The project aims to create a community-driven roadmap as well as facilitate
    concrete solutions that are beyond the scope of the disjointed efforts of its
    individual stakeholders. The Big Data Hubs and Spokes ecosystem is the ideal framework
    to realizing this vision and accelerating progress in this high-priority area
    of research. The effort at hand sets out to implement some of the key findings
    of the recent NSF Division of Chemistry workshop on Framing the Role of Big Data
    and Modern Data Science in Chemistry. The four signature initiatives of this Spoke
    project include (i) the planning, coordination, integration, and consolidation
    of community-developed software tools for big data research in chemistry as well
    as the formulation of guidelines, best practices, and standards; (ii) the organization
    of workshops for community building, to connect solution seekers with solution
    providers, and to address questions ranging from strategic to technical; and (iii)
    the creation and dissemination of community-developed teaching materials as well
    as the formulation of course, program, and curricular recommendations for education
    and workforce development that reflect the changing, data-centric approach in
    chemical research; (iv) providing access to a shared hardware infrastructure for
    community data sets, on-site data mining capacity, and the exploration of domain
    specific method and hardware issues.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    promise in the quest for performance under hypersonic conditions related to sub-orbital
    and reusable space vehicles. This IRES will provide a 10-week summer session every
    year for 3 years, to enable 4 US students annually, both at the graduate and undergraduate
    levels, to acquire knowledge in manufacturing, testing and simulation of advanced
    material systems exhibiting durability in extreme environments. Through the program,
    students experience large-scale facilities at DLR Aerospace in Cologne, Germany,
    including materials manufacturing and testing systems to design and develop experimental
    samples. This experience offers joint participation of US and German researchers
    in synchrotron studies at the Argonne National Laboratory with mentorship from
    both German and US-based scientists. Students will gain a rare insight into the
    full cycle of emerging materials research. Research outcomes have long terms societal
    benefits in creating a new class of materials for next generation energy, propulsion
    and transportation needs. The educational broader impact of the international
    collaborative research is achieved through i) an exchange of knowledge of high
    resolution techniques in processing, experimentation and simulation ii) opportunities
    for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to experience collaborative
    research in highly advanced facilities focused on each expertise with mentoring
    from highly trained scientists as well as peer mentoring between graduate and

    in the field of magnetics research in the UK and Europe. It is also home to several
    eminent faculty members in magnetics. Cardiff University and Iowa State Universities
    have had long-standing research collaborations and the PI and co-PI?s have all
    worked at Cardiff University and have good network connections with the current
    faculty and staff members. Cardiff University, and in particular the Wolfson Centre
    for Magnetics, offers resident expertise and access to advanced measurement facilities
    in magnetics. American students will gain good research experience from the work
    they will carry out at Cardiff University as well as the valuable broadening experience
    that comes from working in a foreign country. \nThe following five research topics
    match expertise and interests at both Iowa State University and Cardiff University
    and should attract a large number of applicants to the program: Magnetocaloric
    Materials; Magnetostrictive Materials; Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE); Transcranial
    Magnetic Stimulation (TMS); Unified Theory of Hysteresis in Magnetic Systems.
    \nFive students, two graduates and three undergraduates from colleges and universities
    across Iowa and who are permanent residents of the United States will be chosen
    for international research experience under this grant. Special efforts will be
    made to recruit under-represented minority or female students in STEM subjects.
    The students will spend ten weeks each summer at Cardiff University and two weeks
    at Iowa State University. The graduate students will be allowed to choose the
    research topics which will be closely related to their thesis. The undergraduates
    will be selected from Electrical & Computer Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering,

- abstractText: "Drylands (arid and semi-arid ecosystems) are of global ecological
    and socioeconomic importance as they cover nearly half of the earth's terrestrial
    surface and support a large and growing portion of the earth's human population
    and livestock production. Despite their importance, ecological processes in drylands
    are poorly understood relative to wetter systems. This lack of knowledge limits
    available information for informed dryland management. The project aims to address
    this knowledge gap by training US undergraduate and graduate students to carry
    out international research in dryland ecosystems. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb
    Research Opportunity will provide intensive training for eighteen US students
    over a three year period. The student activities will last for eight weeks each
    summer, during which students will conduct research at the Gobabeb Research and
    Training Centre, located in the heart of the oldest desert in the world, the Namib
    Desert of Namibia. US students will work collaboratively with Namibian interns,
    Namibian mentors, and US PIs to design and carry out novel research projects that
    will use a unique precipitation gradient to explore how climate and soil composition
    affect ecological processes in drylands. Students will prepare for the research
    experience through an online seminar in the semester before travel and will participate
    in follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following their research experience.
    These research projects will train a cohort of US students in research techniques,
    positioning them for careers that will advance our understanding of dryland ecosystems.
    The use of research teams composed of US students, Namibian interns, and Namibian
    faculty mentors will provide valuable training in collaborative research and communication
    skills. This program will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged
    dryland scientists, thus enhancing capacities and contributing to the ecological
    knowledge base, paramount for sustainable use and management of drylands. \n\nScientific
    understanding of ecological processes in dryland systems is limited relative to
    wetter systems. This knowledge gap reflects both historical research biases and
    the transmission of these biases to successive generations of student scientists.
    Little scientific study of drylands is amplified by the fact that vast areas of
    global drylands are located in developing nations with limited scientific resources.
    A step toward enhancing our basic and applied knowledge in drylands is providing
    training opportunities for students in international dryland research and developing
    a next generation of scientific leaders who can effectively collaborate in international
    arenas. Increased leadership by US scientists in international dryland research
    will enhance understanding of our own drylands and improve basic science and land
    management in developing nations. The Namib Desert of Namibia offers a unique
    natural experiment for quantifying mechanistic controls over biogeochemical, ecological,
    and physiological processes in drylands because of a steep precipitation gradient
    coincides with contrasting soil surfaces. The close geographic proximity of sites
    with contrasting rainfall and soil types, access to a well-equipped research station,
    and existing relationships with Namibian scientists make this an excellent site
    for a research training program that will help develop a new generation of internationally-engaged
    dryland scientists. The Global Drylands Center-Gobabeb Research Opportunity (GDC-GRO)
    will facilitate research projects which will be carried out by teams of US students
    (undergraduate and graduate) and Namibian interns who will work closely with Namibian
    mentors and US PIs. A total of eighteen US students will participate (four undergraduates
    and two graduate students in each of the three years). Intensive IRES activities
    will last eight weeks each year, with preparation activities in the semester beforehand
    through an online seminar and follow-up synthesis activities in the semester following
    the IRES experience. Key players in this proposal are Namibian mentors (from University
    of Namibia, Namibia University of Science and Technology and Gobabeb Research
    and Training Centre) who are eager to work with student teams and US PIs to develop
    substantive research projects across the Namib precipitation gradient.\n\nThis
    award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through
    evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review

- abstractText: "This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project
    will engage a diverse group of US students on addressing the challenges faced
    by the water, sanitation, and electricity utilities of the future. In cities and
    towns in low- and middle-income countries, water, sanitation, and electricity
    services are provided through a patchwork of options: water may be provided only
    a few times a week through pipes, while houses use groundwater in the interim;
    electricity may be delivered through unreliable grids combined with decentralized
    solar home systems. At the same time, utilities in high-income countries are confronting
    changes in their industries: water and electricity utilities need to generate
    revenue while also encouraging conservation; wastewater facilities are transitioning
    from treatment and disposal to recovery of energy and nutrients. This presents
    an exciting opportunity to reimagine the future of these utilities. The forefront
    of innovation is occurring in low-income but rapidly developing cities like Nairobi,
    Kenya, which are open to new ideas given their more limited previous investments
    in centralized infrastructure. \n\nThe IRES project will engage seventeen students
    over the course of three years to spend 10-12 weeks working alongside collaborators
    in Nairobi, Kenya, including researchers from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore
    University. The research focuses on addressing the common challenges faced by
    water, electricity, and sanitation utilities in rapidly changing cities. Example
    projects include: designing a sensing system for electric vehicles to provide
    grid balancing in Kenya; comparing the environmental and human health impacts
    of neighborhood- and city-wide human waste management options; improving water
    supply operations and planning; and quantifying the flexibility of industrial
    electricity consumption in Kenya. Students will be recruited from multiple disciplines,
    with a focus on ensuring participation by students traditionally underrepresented
    in STEM. To prepare for the summer spent in Kenya, students will enroll in a one-credit
    course. Projects will be designed such that students have clear objectives and
    can accomplish data collection and analysis within the given timespan, and integrate
    their project into their overall student experience. Students will also have the
    opportunity for professional development, including engaging with industries and
    government in Kenya and participating in a one-week workshop on writing and data
    presentation. The result will be a cohort of US students equipped with the ideas,
    skills, and motivation to improve the service delivery of the water, sanitation,

  title: 'IRES Track 1: Envisioning the Water, Electricity, and Sanitation Utilities
    of the Future through a US-Kenya Collaboration'
- abstractText: "With this award, NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering
    provides three years of support for twelve Davidson College undergraduate students
    to engage in high-impact research opportunities in Dusseldorf, Germany in collaboration
    with the research group of Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann at the Heinrich-Heine-Universitat
    (HHU). The specific research focuses on the preparation of a series of specialized
    compounds that present carbohydrates in a precise fashion to study fundamental
    carbohydrate-protein interactions. These interactions are important because they
    play critical roles in a number of biological processes from cell communication
    to microbial infectivity and cancer. Despite their importance, many questions
    remain as to how the precise presentation of carbohydrates impacts their ability
    to be recognized by proteins, and how the resulting carbohydrate-protein interaction
    impacts downstream biological events. The research outlined in this award aims
    to address this knowledge gap while simultaneously providing valuable research
    opportunities in a high-impact international research setting. Undergraduate participants
    will receive training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer chemistry, molecular
    spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that will enhance their
    education and prepare them for a competitive international workforce. Furthermore,
    results from this award will promote the progress of science by directly advancing
    the fields of carbohydrate and polymer science, including initiatives highlighted
    under the National Academy of Sciences report, \"Transforming the Glycosciences:
    A Roadmap to the Future (2012)\", which specifically emphasizes a broader understanding
    of the roles of carbohydrate polymers in chemical, biological and industrial processes.
    Long term, the results from this research may ultimately lead to advancements
    in national health, prosperity and welfare by providing a better understanding
    of the fundamental roles carbohydrates play in human health and disease. \n\nOne
    of the major challenges in studying molecular interactions between carbohydrates
    and other biomolecules is the low binding affinity of individual carbohydrate
    subunits. Biological systems overcome this issue by increasing localized concentrations
    of carbohydrate residues or by the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands
    on proteins, lipids or cell surfaces. Molecular scaffolds, which can be selectively
    tuned to vary the number and density of sugar ligands along a defined oligomeric
    backbone, can be used to gain fundamental insights into multivalent carbohydrate
    interactions and the processes they govern. The research in this proposal, which
    will be conducted with Davidson College undergraduate participants and in collaboration
    with Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann and her team at Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, uses
    a systematic approach to synthesize several precision glycoconjugates to study
    the relationships between the ways in which carbohydrate ligands are presented
    (e.g. on a rigid oligoproline scaffold versus a more flexible oligo(amidoamine)
    scaffold), and how that presentation impacts carbohydrate binding in two classes
    of carbohydrate binding proteins: galectins and the C-type lectins. The overarching
    research question that will be addressed by the proposed research is: How does
    the presentation of carbohydrates on well-defined rigid or flexible scaffolds
    impact their ability to engage proteins involved in specific recognition events?
    The outcomes of this research will provide greater insight into factors that govern
    carbohydrate recognition and may help scientists better understand how recognition
    events and the corresponding biological outcomes of those events are tuned by
    carbohydrate display.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been
    deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual
    merit and broader impacts review criteria."

- abstractText: "Approximately 95% of all land, sea and air vehicles in the world
    today rely on petroleum to move passengers and freight both locally and internationally.
    This transportation fuel mix produces ~25% of all greenhouse gas emissions and
    is projected to grow in the future with modernization of developing countries.
    International energy agencies note that if transport is to contribute to CO2 reductions
    to meet the 2 degree C global average temperature target, use of technologies
    such as hybrid electric and all electric transportation will have to increase
    in the future. Thus, advances in transportation technologies are clearly a national
    and international issue, and require globally-minded engineers and scientists
    to advance interdisciplinary technologies to develop cleaner regional and global
    transportation systems. Virginia Tech (VT) proposes to expand upon the Future
    Electric Transportation Systems ( FETS) IRES partnership with the University of
    Nottingham (UoN), with a broadened scope and stronger engagement with industry
    and the UK government to establish the Energy, Environment, and Future Electric
    Transportation Systems (E-FETS) IRES program. E-FETS cohorts of ~9 per year will
    investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly
    fuels and extraction methods; energy-efficient, hybridized power train vehicles
    and systems; light-weighting of vehicle structures; and the human factors issues
    that accompany their use and adoption. Among the broader impacts of this IRES
    program are the promotion of international research collaborations that foster
    innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric
    transportation systems into our society as a means to address efficient energy
    use.  \n\nE-FETS will provide an intensive ten-week research experience to undergraduates
    and graduate students with five of the University of Nottingham's internationally
    recognized research groups. These include power electronics, human factors, geo-energy,
    composites and manufacturing, and aerospace propulsion and advanced diagnostics.
    The program will consist of two phases. The first phase includes three pre-departure
    workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at VT to orient
    students to the experience and the project scope. This pre-departure preparation
    aims to build the E-FETS student cohort team in preparation for their work individually
    and together. The second phase consists of 7 weeks at the UoN engaged in concentrated
    research with UoN faculty mentors and facilities. In addition to supervision from
    a VT and UoN faculty member, students will work collaboratively as part of a large
    research team including faculty, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows.
    To facilitate additional professional development, students will also be matched
    with an industry mentor who will meet with the student before, during and after
    their research experience. These mentors will enhance the students? experience
    with international career exploration, professional development, and networking
    in their field and industry. Seminars focused on the scope of E-FETS research
    goals are planned during each phase of the program, providing students with the
    opportunity to connect their individual research projects with the unified research
    theme of E-FETS, and present and get feedback on their IRES experience. By engaging
    industry partners with IRES projects, the E-FETS IRES seeks to leverage industry
    and UK government to grow the IRES program and develop a basis for sustainability
    beyond the grant.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been

    Raman microscopy is a powerful tool for nondestructive, label-free chemical imaging that has found numerous applications in the pharmaceutical, forensic, semiconductor, materials science, and biological fields.  The PI has developed a faster and lower cost Raman micro-spectrometer, a tool that allows mapping of chemical composition and other material properties at microscopic scales.  Broader and easier access to Raman mapping could in turn prompt innovation in how the tool is used for a vast range of applications, from biomedical research, to food and pharma, to engineering materials.  This project provides an opportunity for market research that will result in a thorough and deep understanding of the customer needs when it comes to chemical mapping and how their technology could potentially alleviate the customer's pain points and capture new customers.  The scientist involved will learn fundamental entrepreneurial skills that will not only help in the commercialization efforts of this technology but could also be applied towards their future research endeavors.

    The PI's technology is a novel confocal Raman microscope capable of imaging at speeds up to 100 times faster than conventional point-scan Raman microscopy. This project involves market research where a range of potential customers are involved in assessing the current chemical imaging market and the requirements for future products in this field.  The result will help guide a decision on whether this product (or a similar product) has market value, the most valuable product features that can be incorporated or developed, and the market(s) where these products should initially be marketed.  With this investigation, it is expected that a proper decision on the future of this technology can be made along with a decision on future developments that increase the likelihood of commercial success.

    This innovation demonstrates how advanced algorithm information technologies can transform the medical care delivery system by shifting the focus to early diagnosis. This technology identifies suspicious skin lesions as positive or negative for the structural properties of Buruli ulcers. Furthermore, this technique validates the classification system for other skin lesions which can be improved and expanded to include other types of skin diseases for humans, animals, and also plants. Point-of-care diagnostics for skin diseases have the potential to not only identify diseases in the early stages, but also create opportunities to initiate medical interventions in earlier stages of a disease, thereby reducing medical costs by treating diseases with antibiotic therapy instead of surgical interventions and eliminating any unnecessary pain and suffering resulting from complications of late-stage disease diagnosis. This innovation is critical for differential diagnosis, disease surveillance, collecting environmental contextual data, medication adherence, and advancing health literacy. This work is important because it contributes to a wider body of knowledge that seeks to validate algorithm development for point-of-care diagnostics, and ultimately improves access to healthcare for rural and hard-to-reach populations, also reducing barriers to care for otherwise stigmatizing and debilitating diseases.

    Advancements in point-of-care diagnostics for neglected tropical diseases, and neglected infections of poverty represents an opportunity to decrease both the incidence and prevalence of debilitating and disfiguring diseases. These otherwise preventable diseases represent the most disability-adjusted life years lost. Representative of an interdisciplinary intervention, image diagnostics for skin diseases require the development of effective means for intervention design, management, and evaluation while enhancing the relationships and collaborations working internationally, across cultures, with community-based primary care, and to also include opportunities for incorporating telehealth to address access to care in resource-limited and hard-to-reach communities. Opportunities to more widely disseminate this research, and to include commercial potential expands the scope of this innovation and provides additional education and training opportunities for students of engineering and public health, but also for clinicians, and community-based healthcare providers. Successful implementation of point-of-care diagnostics for early stage disease detection advances the disciplines and allows for the translation of the innovation, analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of research for future education and training. Lastly, the advancement of this type of innovation has the ability to shift the medical system to early diagnosis reducing the overall disease burden of ill-health and disability due to late stage diagnosis of disease.

    institutions to identify and assess unnecessary burden resulting from policies
    and processes that can be addressed only through cooperation. Targeted projects,
    pilots, and demonstrations are an important and defining component of the FDP.
    Once a new approach is successfully beta tested by a few willing institutions
    and agencies within the FDP, it is generally accepted by the FDP's members and
    often by most research funding agencies and recipients. A study and 2016 report
    by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on \"Optimizing
    the Nation's Investment in Academic Research\" cites and references the work of
    the FDP throughout.   The work that the FDP has accomplished in the past has achieved
    national recognition and the current proposal outlines further plans for maximizing
    federal investments in research.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
    intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    This project will enable the reproducible analysis and sharing of large human brain imaging datasets.  Imaging the brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for the study of the human brain, but the processing of large neuroimaging datasets is often a difficult and time-consuming process. This project will improve the ability of researchers to analyze these data more effectively and share the results.  This work will build upon the OpenNeuro project, which provides researchers with the ability to easily upload and share neuroimaging data. The first aim of this project is to develop the ability to process these datasets using national supercomputing resources. Because these resources are both much more powerful and more cost-effective than commercial cloud computing resources, this extension will allow researchers to process larger datasets using more sophisticated analysis procedures.  The second aim is to extend the reach of data storage and processing beyond standard neuroimaging datasets to include heterogeneous datasets with clinical and psychological data in addition to brain imaging data. A large study of human brain development will be used as a test case for this extension. The third aim of this project is to engage researchers and software developers in order to develop a broad community that will further extend the reach and capabilities of the proposed technical developments and promote the sustainability of the resources beyond the grant period.

    The first aim will implement the ability to execute computational workflows using national supercomputing resources through a Science-As-A-Service model, via technologies such as the Agave API and the Singularity container system.  This will provide the ability for researchers to execute complex containerized workflows using large datasets, providing a long-term sustainable computational platform for analysis of open data. The second aim will involve the extension of the current OpenNeuro platform to represent data from a large longitudinal neurodevelopmental study, in order to allow the joint analysis of imaging, clinical, psychological, and genetic data.  The third aim will engage the relevant user and developer communities through workshops and code sprints.

    Frequently research on data integration carried out by computer scientists and resulting tools must be modified to fit the needs of domain practitioners (ecologists in this case). This challenge is a socio-technical, collective action problem that can be addressed through a combination of tools and incentives. The project proposes to holding a series of workshops along with proofs-of-concept implementations. These workshops will result in approaches to decentralize the sharing of data in the long tail, through socio-technical approaches that appropriately incentivize and facilitate data integration by smaller labs. Such an interdisciplinary community will provide crucial real-world input to computer science researchers, which will give their research into tools the potential for larger impact in ecological practice and will yield better tools for ecologists.

    Today's cities and communities, and their residents, are increasingly connected, and decisions are informed by actionable, real-time data. Data is making modern cities and local communities faster and safer, as well as more sustainable, livable, and equitable. At the same time, smart city technologies raise concerns about individuals' privacy, autonomy, choice, and possible misuse. Government officials are raising important questions about who should own data, how privacy protections for public-facing technologies work, who and how to communicate with the public about privacy, and more. The long-term vision of the project is to help municipal leaders strengthen their ability to collect, use, and share data in a responsible manner. This will help grow privacy-preserving innovations across applications and geographic boundaries for the public good. In this way, the Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke will serve to increase public knowledge, understanding and engagement with privacy-related concerns, and ultimately promote the public's trust in smart city technologies and in their local government.

    The Smart Privacy for Smart Cities Spoke is a collaborative project led by the FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF). It will undertake three interrelated activities to help city/community innovators understand and incorporate privacy considerations and protections into smart city projects. First, the Spoke will produce a privacy risk assessment framework for smart city projects, including guidance on what policies, practices and accountability structures should be put in place and how to weigh benefits of new or expanded data techniques against attendant privacy and security risks. The framework will feature a de-identification component as de-identification is one of the primary measures that organizations can take to protect and share data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the Spoke will establish a network of privacy leaders for smart cities and communities, helping municipal officials better understand, communicate, and collaboratively address privacy issues and principles. Lastly, the Spoke will hold two workshops in partnership with MetroLab Network, a national network of 40+ city-university partnerships advancing technological approaches to urban challenges. The workshops will serve to launch the privacy leaders network; educate network members about the privacy risk assessment framework; and identify areas for further collaboration and research, particularly in applying the framework to specific technologies and data uses. Expected project outcomes include wide dissemination of the privacy risk assessment framework and its adoption in specific localities; development of new collaborations and partnerships through the privacy leaders network and associated workshops; and as an overall outcome, the advancement of civic leaders' knowledge, understanding, and application of privacy protection(s) toward standards of practice for smart cities and privacy. The project will support and leverage the Hub Network, in particular the South Big Data Hub, NSF's Smart and Connected Communities program, and the MetroLab Network of city-university partners.

    The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level. As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

As a Spoke to NSF?s Midwest Big Data Hub, our efforts can be efficiently scaled, disseminated, and applied to the opioid and other societal problems such as infant mortality, crime, and natural disasters. This project fits within NSF's mission to promote the progress of science (contribute to the science and engineering of large socially relevant cyberinfrastructures) to advance the health and welfare of US citizens (by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address societal problems; establishing sustainable partnerships between academia, industry, government and communities; increasing data literacy and community engagement with data science; and enhancing research and education via development/adaptation of training modules and courses in data analytics).

    The main goal of this project is to help small and rural communities in the Midwest address the opioid epidemic via BIGDATA (BD) technology. While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by "dead zones" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities.  (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term.

    The risk to coastal populations and infrastructure from flooding due to sea level rise, severe storms, and river discharge will increase for U.S. southern states. The vision of this project is that communities occupying low-lying coastal areas of the southern US will be protected and develop in a sustainable manner through planning based on knowledge, conservation, and wise use of sensitive lands. Researchers from the University of South Florida's College of Marine Science and the School of Geosciences, Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, and Google Earth Engine are collaborating with the South Big Data Hub through this project to develop more accurate, ultra-high resolution topographic, land cover, and urban environment geospatial products. The project examines in detail areas that were directly impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017, and identifies flood-prone areas across the region. The 3D maps show habitat diversity, needed to plan for conservation and development in these important ecosystems.

    This project will develop the improved topographic and land cover maps of the south States within 50 Km of the coast from Texas to Florida (an area >220,000 square Km). The maps will be constructed using a Big Data approach, using detailed historical airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data collected from airplanes merged with high spatial resolution (<2 m pixel) multispectral commercial satellite imagery. The project will also include research into detailed 3D mapping of urban areas using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods; specifically the project will map portions of Houston/Corpus Christi in Texas, and Tampa/Saint Petersburg in Florida, using Kite Photography and light aircraft. The production of land cover maps and digital elevation models requires the fusion of very large amounts of disparate data and efficient, automated techniques. The project will develop the strategies to aggregate these data into useful products using Google Earth Engine and a High Performance Computing cluster. The project will distribute all products openly via NOAA's Digital Coastal portal.

- abstractText: "This project focuses on investigating a new paradigm in renewable
    energy harvesting that would be of great use for developing modular power source
    for use in most of the developing world, and specifically for the continent of
    Africa.  Currently only 20-23% of the population in Africa has access to electricity.
    \ Large percentage of the population lives far from urban centers.  Only portable
    energy sources will be able to meet, at least partially, the energy needs of rural
    populations.  A diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled
    in this program will engage in research on a novel concept of renewable energy
    harvesting.  They will develop working modules that will be tested in the field
    with the aim of producing efficient portable energy sources to improve the lives
    of people living in rural Africa.  In addition, the cultural experience gained
    through interactions with the tribal communities in Africa, and the knowledge
    gained on the way of life in each tribe, their societal rules and norms, and the
    struggles they face in day-to-day life, will transform their view of the world.
    \ Their efforts will be highly rewarding, as they will be contributing to increase
    the renewable and portable power generation in these remote areas that will greatly
    improve the quality of life for the segment of the world population that is lagging
    behind the norms. \nTo implement the project the PI at the University of South
    Florida (USF) will collaborate with the researchers at the Botswana International
    University of Science and Technology (BIUST).  After completing a 3-week research
    program at USF, students will travel to Botswana and will team up with a cohort
    of students at BIUST for a 5-week period where they will learn, live, work, and
    travel together. \n\nThe primary goal of research is to study the feasibility
    of combining thermoelectric modules and solar devices to generate much higher
    electrical power than what is possible with individual devices.  Thermoelectric
    modules formed with materials of high Seebeck coefficient can produce high voltages
    but low conductivity that leads to low currents.  Typical solar cell open-circuit
    voltages are relatively low, but high absorption of radiation can generate high
    density of carriers.  However, high carrier recombination losses lead to low short
    circuit current.  This project will investigate a novel paradigm in which the
    relatively high voltage (1-4 V) produced by the thermoelectric modules from the
    recovery of waste heat of cooking stoves used in rural Africa will be used to
    reverse-bias the solar cell for generating a high photo-generated current.  The
    combination of the high voltage, high current, combined with a suitable circuit
    design, has the potential to enhance power generation and more efficient charging
    of batteries or capacitors.  The outcome will be educating a cohort of graduate
    and undereducated students on energy challenges of the rural communities in the
    world, and developing innovative concepts based on fundamental science to resolve
    issues of the global society. Though the initial effort is to develop a power
    source for rural Africa, the concept can be extended to multitude of commercial
    products and military applications where power can be generated when plugging
    into the power grid is not an option.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission

    The goal of this Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project is for undergraduate student participants to develop skills in conducting and communicating scientific research, to utilize an integrative field and lab research approach using digital technology and modern analytical lab equipment, and to learn international cooperation by collaborating side-by-side with Mexican students, professors, and mining professionals to address research questions on the tectonic evolution of  economically important rift margin basins in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Each year of this three-year program, a cohort of ten undergraduate students will be hosted by Minera Boleo mine for four weeks in January in Baja California Sur, Mexico. Students will conduct geologic fieldwork in topical groups (basin analysis, volcanology, neotectonics, and mineralogy) that will be co-mentored by Mexican and U.S. faculty. Field samples will be sent for geochemical, petrographic, and geochronological analyses. Then in July of the same year, Baja Basins IRES students will reconvene for collaborative lab work and data analyses at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. This will culminate in preparation of student abstracts and poster displays for a local symposium.  Clear educational outcomes and career goals will be measured by appropriate assessment strategies. We will recruit junior undergraduate geoscience majors both nationally and regionally near our home institutions, as this will facilitate the participation of under-represented minority, first-time college, and veteran students who often remain close to their hometown when pursuing higher education. Our collaboration with Mexican colleagues and mining professionals, and the international nature of the fieldwork will provide an unparalleled avenue for cultural enrichment for the students as well as an experience in global cooperation that will be invaluable for a student's future success in an increasingly global workforce and economy.

    The Baja Basins International Research Experiences for Students (Baja Basins IRES) project will provide ten undergraduate student a year with the opportunity to investigate basins located along the central Gulf of California rift in Baja California Sur Mexico, an area that has not been thoroughly mapped within the framework of tectonics and thus provides an excellent field location to study the progressive evolution of a rifted continental margin and its unique continued magmatic activity and economic mineralization. The young geologic age of the sedimentary basins, excellent exposures, and field access, as well as sedimentary fill with numerous tuffs and uplifted terraces dateable by radiometric and OSL methods, make it ideal for resolving the rates of development of structures and resulting depositional systems. This Baja Basins IRES program will provide students with an unprecedented opportunity to collaborate internationally with mentors from our partner universities in Mexico (Universidad Autonoma de Baja California Sur and Universidad de Guanajuato) and several mining companies. Students will develop field and laboratory skills in basin analysis and tectonics in a volcanic-sedimentary sequence that is geologically interesting, economically important, and culturally diverse.

    This project will support the "Graduate-level Research in Industrial Projects for Students-Berlin" (GRIPS) led by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). The program will offer graduate students in mathematics and related disciplines the opportunity to work on industry-sponsored research problems in Berlin through a collaboration with Research Campus MODAL in Berlin, Germany. MODAL has existing industrial partners affiliated with their laboratories that provide their research groups with interesting and challenging research problems.  The program will be eight weeks in length; eight US graduate students will participate each summer.  Half of the US students each year will be women, and one or more will be a member of an underrepresented ethnic group. MODAL will  recruit 8 European students to form 4 research groups of two US and two European students each, and provide academic mentors. The program will not only produce interesting research in applications of mathematics to real-life problems, but will give a diverse group of US students an insight into industrial research and provide them with hands-on experience of working on industrial problems. One of the goals of the program is to make the students aware of the multiple career pathways open to them and highlight the value and adaptability of their mathematics skills as applied to interesting real-life problems.  The students will also receive invaluable experience collaborating with foreign colleagues and companies. The projects will be the natural outgrowth of MODAL's existing industry research partnerships, and will be selected in collaboration with IPAM.    Participants will produce a final report on their work, and will be encouraged to submit their work for conference presentations and/or publication in technical journals.  It is expected that many of the participants will continue the research and collaborations they started in the program.

    Applied mathematics research has become increasingly important and relevant to engineering problems and, indeed, to everyday life. Increasingly, core applied mathematics topics, ranging from applied probability, to partial differential equation, to optimization, find important applications in areas such as materials science, mathematical biology, operations research, and, more recently, machine learning. Applications of mathematical techniques to real-life problems require both a deep understanding of mathematical theory, as well as acute awareness of both the physical and technical aspects of the problem, as well as implementation details of any numerical algorithms or simulations. For this reason, such successful applications are often a combination of individual and team efforts, with the main problem being divided into more specialized parts, and specific expertise of each team member brought to bear on each such  component.The exact topics of the research projects will change from year to year and will depend on the interest of industry and academic researchers involved.  Generally speaking, the projects will apply mathematical techniques to questions of optimization (such as optimization of rail network throughput), efficient simulation (such as simulation of modern nanophotonic devices) and machine learning (such as analysis of medical mass data sets).

- abstractText: "The islands of Oceania are home to diverse fish communities and a
    vibrant myriad of human cultures, all of which have histories are inseparably
    tied to characteristics of the ocean and the islands themselves (e.g. resource
    availability and habitat space), and extent of connectivity among distant islands
    (e.g. currents, migration, etc.). These unifying concepts between culture and
    marine ecology make the holistic study of Pacific Island life ideal for a cross-disciplinary
    research experience.  The PAC-ISLEs program is a year-long research experience
    punctuated by a six-week trip to Oceania, where students will conduct independent
    research projects in marine biology and anthropology, and connect the shared themes
    uniting the two disciplines.  Each year new cohorts will visit a different island
    in Oceania (American Samoa, Tonga, Pohnpei), where they will immerse themselves
    in local communities and collaborate with key foreign mentors that possess expertise
    in community-based conservation, marine ecology, and public education.  Upon returning
    to the US, students will take advantage of the extensive natural history and ethnology
    collections at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture to support their
    research projects, and help them share their findings with the public, including
    a highly-engaged community of Pacific Islanders in the Seattle metropolitan area
    and beyond.  \n\nThe islands of Oceania support fish communities and human cultures
    whose histories are inseparably tied to their physical and geographic characteristics
    (e.g. resource availability and habitat space), and the extent of connectivity
    among distant islands (e.g. dispersal potential, gene flow, history of human migrations
    and trade). Students in the PAC-ISLEs program will travel to a unique island each
    of three years to explore these ties between culture and marine ecology, and characterize
    historic changes by measuring similarities in cultural objects or traditional
    activities among islands, and (for fishes) population genetics, taxonomic composition,
    and phylogeography. Students working with fish communities will focus mainly on
    the evolution and community structure of cryptobenthic reef fishes, a poorly studied
    group that can serve as an ideal indicator for evolutionary and contemporary change
    across Pacific Islands. Students working on Pacific Island anthropology will focus
    on aspects of culture that are directly linked to the ocean either through their
    material origins, or role in passing on knowledge about the ocean to future generations.
    Much like the biological communities of Pacific Islands, cultural items may be
    compared across different islands to show the history of change, local adaptation,
    and technological progression. When these data are analyzed and contextualized
    with existing and extensive biological and anthropological collections from Oceania
    at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, findings from PAC-ISLEs have
    the potential to greatly advance our understanding of biological and cultural
    diversity on and around Pacific Islands, while promoting an equitable exchange
    of knowledge between scientists and Pacific Islander communities. Student activities
    extend far beyond the duration of this project, as PAC-ISLEs will help establish
    a permanent conduit for students to connect with overseas sites that would otherwise
    be less accessible for students.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission
    and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's

    Economic globalization is transforming the nature of the engineering profession.  The assignment of U.S. engineers overseas has become common business practice, as global enterprises establish corporate as well as research and development centers worldwide. To remain at the forefront of science and technology and to sustain our nation's global leadership in engineering, we must train our engineering graduates to be productive professionals in tomorrow's global business world and provide them the skills they will need to collaborate with international partners. This three-year IRES program will teach some of those critical skills to U.S. engineering students by providing hands-on research training and cultural experiences in one of the fastest growing regions in the world. The students will conduct research in Egypt with U.S. and Egyptian investigators in the increasingly important field of sustainable urban design. The need for sustainable housing and infrastructure is particularly acute in Egypt, a nation where 95% of the population lives on just 6% of the land area. Students will leverage the many national research initiatives currently underway in Egypt to investigate and test sustainable infrastructure designs. Participants will receive extensive mentoring before, during, and after their international experience from the U.S. and Egyptian researchers, with the ultimate goal of conducting high-level research and preparing research papers for publication in peer-reviewed journals. By working closely with their international mentors, the students will enhance their cross-cultural skills, foreign language abilities, and professional experience, preparing them to excel in a multinational environment.

    This three-year IRES project will provide approximately 30 undergraduate and graduate engineering students research training and cultural experiences in Egypt. The students will work with U.S. mentors and Egyptian researchers at one of the leading national research centers in Egypt, the National Housing and Building Research Center. The program will focus on the multidisciplinary theme of Infrastructure Design for Sustainable Urban Communities. The Egyptian government is currently pressing major research initiatives and demonstration projects related to sustainable urban design, including entire new cities built around sustainability principles. Our students will leverage these ongoing programs to explore and evaluate new designs for urban infrastructure that consider building materials, construction methods, energy efficiency, and water conservation. Working with our Egyptian partners, the researchers have identified eight research projects for the first year of the program that address the topics of sustainable affordable housing, the assessment of sustainable building codes, infrastructure health monitoring, sustainable building materials, water and stormwater management, and intelligent building designs. Additional research topics will be developed in subsequent years. Students will work side-by-side with Egyptian researchers with the goal of performing high-level research and producing student-led, peer-reviewed publications. The program will ultimately produce students who have the skills and international perspective necessary to pursue careers in collaborative international research.

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will provide  international research experiences for at least 12 undergraduate and/or graduate students to carry out international collaborative researches at the School of Renewable Energy of North China Electric Power University (NCEPU) in Beijing, China for 8 weeks. The objective of the IRES project is to provide the future American engineers a global perspective and opportunities for their professional growth through meaningful international cooperative research training, networking and mentoring in the fields of renewable energy and environmental sustainability in general, and biomass processing technology and wind turbine aeromechanics, in particular. This  project will bring together IRES participants, involved professors, Chinese faculty members, and their graduate/undergraduate students with multi-cultural background in a multi-level learning experience infused with the excitement of discovery. It will train participants conduct research  in an international research environment  to remain at the forefront of world science and technology, making them more proficient in the technical subjects. The program will provide opportunities for their professional development to build their future collaboration network and expose them to Chinese culture and tradition, applicable technological trends and business practices.

    The research themes of this IRES program are wind turbine aeromechanics and pyrolysis-based biomass thermochemical conversion. By leveraging the unique research facilities and instruments/equipment available at NCEPU and under the supervision of the Chinese faulty mentors, the IRES students on "biomass track" will investigate the effects of blended biomass feedstocks and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes for synergistic production of high quality biofuels and value-added chemicals, while the IRES students on "wind energy track" will conduct comprehensive experimental investigations to quantify surface wind characteristics and evaluate their effects on the aeromechanic performance and wake interferences of wind turbines sited over various complex terrains for higher total power yield and better durability of wind turbines operating on onshore and offshore wind farms. In addition to working in the laboratory to conduct innovative research, the IRES students will also participate in various social and cultural exchanging activities in order to enhance student-faculty, student-mentor and student-student interactions to enable the IRES participants to build their personal friendship and professional connections with participating Chinese mentors and students as well as among the IRES participants themselves on which to build networking for their future professional development and collaboration.

- abstractText: "Fulfilling the promise of \"Big Data\" for fields, such as migration
    studies, climate science, and food security systems, requires accurate and timely
    data from countries across the globe. Data collected through Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) technologies, such as remote sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
    have the potential to contribute to global data hubs. However, most IoT applications
    and their data structures are designed to solve local problems, such as crop protection
    and local food shortage predictions. This IRES SITTE project will train 18 U.S.
    master's students in multicriteria design of and policies for IoT systems with
    the aim of making local IoT data available to global data scientists. \n\nThe
    project involves collaborations with professors/mentors at University of Rwanda
    and Carnegie Mellon Africa, both in Kigali, Rwanda, the former of which serves
    as the Center of Excellence for IoT under the World Bank's Eastern and Southern
    Africa Higher Education Centers of Excellence program. Through the collaboration,
    students will receive interdisciplinary research training in wireless networks,
    software engineering, policy studies and sociotechnical systems. This interdisciplinary
    training will enable designs of low cost IoT systems, usable in a range of contexts,
    including the U.S., while increasing access to data by biology/agriculture and
    forced migration scientists. The training will also enhance students' as well
    as the project's advisory board, consisting of academic scientists and an industry
    innovation professional, on information and communication technology (ICT) innovations
    systems in East Africa, expanding global perspectives within the U.S. IT workforce.\n\nFulfilling
    the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) requires ongoing systems innovation
    to incorporate advances in foundational technologies, lower costs, and fulfill
    the needs of global data scientists. Designing systems for integration of sensor-derived
    local data into global scientific data platforms, such as the Global Open Data
    for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) hub and the International Organization for
    Migration's (IOM) Migration Data Portal, can simultaneously inform local, regional
    and global challenges of socioeconomic and environmental development. \nThis IRES
    Site Program pursues novel IoT research. The interdisciplinary research combines
    complementary wireless network, software engineering, policy studies, and sociotechnical
    systems expertise of the three mentors and the PI.  The program consists of three
    projects, two technical and one focused on policy analysis. \n\nThe first technical
    project involves unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones) designed for collecting
    data from refugee gardens. Using cameras, the UAVs collect image data processed
    through a Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), a standard approach for
    vegetation monitoring. The UAV will also be controlled by software to optimize
    its path-planning, enhancing both coverage i.e. canvassing the target area, and
    network connectivity.  The second technical project targets device-to-device communications
    (D2D) for systems without access to a power grid, through innovations in hardware,
    software and data management systems, designed to improve crop information on
    tea estates.  A third project focuses on IoT policy analyses at national and organizational
    levels. The analyses will highlight current trends in Rwandan IoT use, system
    vulnerabilities, as well as national and organizational policies that may affect
    data sharing practices and hinder access by Big Data scientists.\n\nThis IRES
    Site Program develops interdisciplinary and creative information technology professionals
    capable of solving multi-criteria design problems. Through intellectually challenging
    yet appropriately scoped projects, master's students are exposed to international
    innovation systems and gain insights into the culture of East Africa. The program's
    design includes both pre-departure and follow-on courses, insuring effective student
    preparation and widespread dissemination of results.\n\nThis award reflects NSF's
    statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using
    the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

    The scientific goal of this IRES is to gain better understanding for the fabrication of air-stable, photon upconversion thin films or liquids that can operate efficiently with diffuse sunlight, without the need of volatile organic solvents that currently limit practical use in applications.  Complete immersion in Japanese society by spending four to eight weeks in Kyushu University will provide an opportunity to experience and understand the people, traditions and culture. The cultural and scientific exposure that the U.S. students will obtain from this international collaboration will be invaluable. Kyushu University is one of the top-ranked universities in Japan, and the cosmopolitan metropolis of Fukuoka is welcoming to foreigners. This opportunity is expected to enhance the global competitiveness of the participating students in the STEM workforce, and will be made available to qualified U.S. students, especially those underrepresented in science and engineering, by broadly reaching out to the California State university system, the Univ. of California system, and students attending professional conferences organized for example, by the American Chemical Society and Materials Research Society.

    In this international collaboration, four U.S. undergraduate and/ or graduate participants per year will perform fundamental research on triplet-fusion based photon upconversion both in California and Japan. The fusion of molecular excited states with triplet character is the only method for directly upconverting photons from the sun. While these high photon upconversion quantum yields have been demonstrated in volatile organic solvents, they are generally lower in thin film due to poor triplet exciton diffusion. The U.S. students will be synthesizing and fabricating liquid or thin-films of semiconductor nanocrystals and molecular emitters organized in various hosts, including proteins, organogels and surfactants, to understand and control the diffusion of photogenerated triplet excitons. This project aims to use semiconductor nanocrystals to absorb light strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths to address one of the major limitations in molecular triplet photosensitizers. The hybrid nanomaterials will be designed to halt the spontaneous crystallization of the molecular emitter with nitrene crosslinking chemistry; increase triplet diffusion lengths in liquids or thin films with long-range order in covalent organic frameworks and establish a barrier to oxygen to prevent the quenching of spin-triplet excitons.

    Records of past climate variability from northern Europe will improve our ability to predict future environmental changes in the North Atlantic region. This IRES project will partner with premier universities in Estonia to train students in interdisciplinary field-based environmental science methods in order to develop archives of past temperature and precipitation changes from the Baltic region. Each year the project will involve initial orientations, 5 weeks of international summer field and lab-based instruction, follow-up laboratory work at home institutions during the academic year, and conference presentations in the spring. A total of 4 students (undergraduate and graduate) and 1 in-service public science teacher (RET) each year will be recruited, and all the undergraduate participants will be from 2 year colleges in northern Illinois. Students from underrepresented groups will be targeted, and at least one undergraduate student per year will be from a non-STEM background.

    This project will apply a multi-proxy approach to explore the timing and causes of historic climate variability in northern Europe. Student projects will be interrelated to develop a better understanding of how shifting Northern Hemisphere temperatures and mean-state conditions of the North Atlantic Ocean have influenced the climate dynamics of the eastern Baltic region. These datasets will serve as predictive tools for future variation across the Northern Hemisphere. Student projects will focus on lake sediment geochemistry (stable isotopes - ?18O and ?13C), paleoecology, and biology as tools to reconstruct past climate conditions. The educational goals are to: 1) Engage students in societally-relevant scientific topics to promote interest in STEM fields; 2) Mentor participants in state-of-the-art scientific research methods to better prepare them for STEM majors, careers, and advanced degrees; 3) Develop participants written and oral communication skills through mentoring and public presentations; and 4) Recruit underrepresented minority students and in-service public science teachers to promote diversity and sustainable impacts in public schools. The program components, project team, and participant experience will be rigorously evaluated by a geoscience education research specialist.

    This research project will develop a collaborative data science platform for computational social science called the Data Science Foundry. The collection and management of large-scale data currently is a relatively unstructured process, with data-processing decisions being made in an ad hoc fashion. Society has started to rely on data-driven science to address policy-related questions, however. The development of a collaborative platform that provides structure will allow social scientists to collaborate and validate each other's studies.  This project has the potential to transform how studies are designed and how data will be processed. The collaborative platform will result in a higher level of trust in the studies conducted via the collaborative curation of study design, procedures, and validation. The collaborative platform also will increase the number of studies that can be done in a short span of time. The platform will be developed as open-source, thereby facilitating interactions with the community and enabling different institutions to install the program.

    This project will develop a collaborative platform that social scientists can use to collaborate and validate each other's studies. The investigative team will attempt to identify the best possible collaborative model for data-driven social science, determine how automation can most enhance the studies, and develop explicit and implicit mechanisms to establish trust in end-to-end data processing pipelines and the results they generate. To aid in the platform's development, the research team will focus on the prediction of outcomes from surveys, a specific yet widely applicable type of problem within computational social science. This class of problems involves much subjective assessment during the feature engineering state as well as copious interpretation during the data transformation stage. These unique challenges will benefit both from a collaborative workflow and from mechanisms that enable trust in the eventual results. The project will bring together three distinct teams to develop this platform: computer scientists to develop abstractions, APIs and systems; statisticians to help with methods and study design; and social scientists to help define the problems and workflow and to provide user feedback.

- abstractText: "Security and privacy play a key role in areas such as health, energy,
    and smart cities, as well as constituting a grand challenge in and of themselves.
    \ Privacy and security are critical for realizing Big Data's promise to advance
    society.  If data are used without regard to privacy of individuals or protection
    of the data, then individuals may be hurt.  If the data?s authenticity is not
    guaranteed, or if data are not permitted to be used at all due to privacy and
    security concerns, then the data's value is not realized. As the information that
    is collected about us grows in quantity, scientific and commercial value, and
    sensitivity, addressing these challenges is crucial to accessing the benefits
    of big data while ensuring that privacy and associated basic rights such as free
    speech and association are respected.   Through two workshops hosted by DIMACS,
    this planning project will advance the research agenda on privacy and security
    for big data, build a community of interested researchers and practitioners, and
    propose regional activities in security and privacy related to the Northeast Big
    Data Hub.  The long-term vision of the project is to catalyze both foundational
    and practical advances in privacy and security for big data that have the ability
    to positively impact society by (1) expanding the extent to which individuals
    can have control over protection of their personal data, and (2) enabling data?s
    value to be harnessed for advances in areas including health, energy, smart cities
    and regions, finance, and education. \n\nThe first event, a workshop on \"Overcoming
    Barriers to Data Sharing including Privacy and Fairness\", will bring together
    computer scientists, legal scholars, social scientists, and consumers of data
    to understand the extent to which privacy currently limits the sharing of data,
    including but not limited to research data, and to develop standards and best
    practices to enable new information flows in domains from healthcare to energy.
    \ The second event, the \"NE BD Hub Workshop on Privacy and Security for Big Data\",
    will bring together privacy and security experts as well as experts in a variety
    of big data application areas to highlight privacy and security issues associated
    with each of the Northeast Big Data hub spokes.  Expected project outcomes include
    broad participation, development of new collaborations and partnerships, production
    and dissemination of tutorial and talk videos, and reports on planned activities
    and potential best practices.\n\n\nThis award is co-funded by the CISE Division
    of Computer and Network Systems (CNS) Secure and Trustworthy Computing (SaTC)

    America's bridges received a C+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 2017. Additionally, the US ranks only 11th world-wide in terms of infrastructure competitiveness. America's infrastructure, particularly its 50-100+ year-old bridges, is in poor health, representing a hidden crisis. Rural areas, due to their lower population density and distance from urban centers, are acutely affected by this crisis, particularly in terms of public safety and economic growth. Limited budgets for planning and maintenance only serve to exacerbate the crisis. To better inform future research, the research team held collaborative conferences and workshops, and conducted stakeholder surveys to identify issues impacting rural bridge health. Outcomes from these activities underscored the value of big data technologies to address the crisis and informed the proposed work. The mission of this multi-institution and multi-sector project is to produce a big data pipeline for rural bridge health management that improves transportation network performance and enhances safety.

    The research team will combine existing and new datasets to address challenges of relevance to bridge owners using scalable and replicable big data pipeline components. Activities will inform bridge owner decision-making by integrating existing datasets and data collected using next-generation health monitoring technologies (e.g., contact and non-contact sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles) with innovative data management techniques. Socio-technical impacts associated with potential decisions will also be assessed. Aging, rural bridge testbeds will be selected in consultation with public and private owners to produce data products that facilitate decision-making and ultimately, provide economical and reliable solutions that improve bridge health. Results from the research will be shared with engineers, owners, and builders at workshops hosted by the research team. Project findings will be disseminated through publications, conferences, meetings, and forums. The research team will engage with the Big Data Hubs and Spokes network to make data, methods, and results available across regions. By extension, project findings will also benefit activities used to monitor and manage other important infrastructure assets, including highways, buildings, power grids, offshore oil platforms, water networks, and other civil infrastructures.

    The scientific community is facing a major challenge dealing with the increasing amount of open scientific data emerging from research projects on all scales-- from large facilities to small research labs. Over the last five years the NSF has funded more than 200 high-speed connections to the Internet-2 backbone operating at 10-100Gbps speeds. The goal of this project is to develop a prototype module for a high performance distributed storage system that extends the usability of the existing high-speed interconnects. This project is a pilot for a potential national-scale storage infrastructure for open scientific data, which at full scale could serve hundred sites and many hundreds of Petabytes.  Many of the technologies associated with such a distributed system already exist; the key challenge in this project is social engineering: how can one design a simple enough yet robust storage node that can be easily replicated, is attractive for universities and research projects to adopt, is easy to manage and can support the various patterns for large scale scientific analyses?

    Many universities have several of the necessary pieces for Data Intensive Science in place-- reasonably sized computing clusters, a few PB of storage and even a high-speed connection-- yet performing the analyses of data intensive science is very painful and slow. Data is never there when needed, large storage systems often fail despite having massive RAID configurations, and moving data from disk-to-disk at the full network speed still requires complex skills. The project offers a broad community buy-in through the Big Data Hubs, a unique combination of skills, facilities and science challenges to test, evaluate and deploy different hardware and software combinations that can be used in the design of a much larger, national-scale system. The goal is to design and run detailed benchmarks for various test science projects requiring different combinations of data transfer, data processing and massive compute, and use the results to design and build a low-cost, scalable petascale appliance including inexpensive hardware nodes and a simple software stack that can be replicated across many universities, supercomputer centers and large NSF facilities. The proposed system could become an enormous multiplier on the existing NSF investments in high end computing and fast networks. It could also accelerate the pace of standardization of data storage across the nation. The public, open data products, often discussed in the Data Management Plans at the end of NSF proposals could find an easy-to-use home. Various educational projects could simply rely upon a robust storage infrastructure with a simple API, and build a variety of delivery services for the educational community.

  title: 'EAGER: Smart Community Big Data Co-op'
- abstractText: |-
    There is a growing awareness of the need for multi-center clinical databases and multi-institutional analyses of healthcare data to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of research findings. Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.

    This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.

- abstractText: |-
    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project provides funding for 10-week summer research experiences in physical-layer security at the University of Coimbra in Portugal.   Over the three-year project duration, the three yearly unifying topics of student projects will be network protocols for secrecy, intentional jamming techniques for secrecy, and novel error-correcting codes for secrecy in wireless networks. Students will implement projects on a software radio platform where appropriate. The disseminated results will aid system designers in adding a completely new layer of security at the physical-layer of modern networks.

    This project will increase the understanding of physical-layer security for communications in real-world sensor networks.  Over the three-year grant period, fifteen students (including at least twelve undergraduates) will conduct research in Coimbra, Portugal.  The Portuguese research mentors are experts in physical-layer security and coding theory. Stronger collaborations between the universities will develop, leading to advanced results in physical-layer security. The research results may alter secure system design across many platforms to produce modern data security solutions. Recruitment of student participants will be performed at several diverse institutions throughout Southern Colorado, and will allow the development of effective mechanisms for attracting underrepresented groups to STEM research.

- abstractText: "In the past several years, cyber-crime and cyber-breaches have exploded,
    due to the increase in commerce conducted on the Internet, as well as increasing
    quantities of sensitive information being stored in databases that can be accessed
    by outside parties.  In addition, cyber-criminals have advanced, not only employing
    technical acumen but also preying on human error by using sophisticated techniques
    like phishing. To address these challenges, the Northeast Big Data Innovation
    Hub (NEBDIH) will convene two workshops to bring together experts from academia,
    government, and industry in the fields of insurance, cybersecurity, data science,
    and policy. The ultimate goal is to develop a collaborative model (e.g., a cross
    sector consortium) that will help to define the frequency and economic/social
    severity related to successful attacks, and to begin to develop baselines for
    measuring and managing cyber risk more effectively. \n \nNEBDIH will seek to gather
    leading academic, government, risk management, general industry and healthcare
    participants, whose mission will be to identify, quantify, and to help mitigate
    risk associated with cyber-related criminal activity. The workshops will serve
    as a forum for these experts to collaborate on: 1) better understanding and defining
    the interrelated cybersecurity landscape across sectors, and 2) planning for the
    resources necessary to develop baselines for measuring and managing cybersecurity
    risk. Expected outcomes from these activities include developing a framework for
    filling the gaps in quantifying and managing cybersecurity risk across organizations
    and sectors.  This may take the form of an initiative that captures the best  of
    breed technologies, vendors, and best practices; captures a substantial portion
    of the data that is required, in aggregate, to make a cybersecurity risk assessment
    at multiple levels (by industry, by region, by company); provides the tools to
    make the data discoverable and interoperable; and provides a basic suite of tools
    to allow for high level analysis of the data within the context of cybersecurity
    risk."

    Non-technical abstract: People living in cities in all regions of the world are experiencing increases in extreme events like floods and heat waves. Urban decision makers need help to develop ways to meet this challenge that are based in scientific understanding. This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) grant is linked to the Urban Resilience to Extremes (UREx) Sustainability Research Network (SRN). The grant will support three graduate students and one undergraduate student each year for ten weeks work in Valdivia, Chile (2017); Hermosillo, Mexico (2018); and in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (2019). A total of nine UREx IRES graduate students will be trained over three years, broadening their skills in collaboration, transdisciplinary research methods, and in mentoring. They will gain appreciation for the unique challenges of Latin American cities, while benefiting from the opportunity to participate in research that is directly used by decision makers, and receive training and experience in workshop facilitation with local decision-makers and communities. Three UREx IRES undergraduate students will also gain research experience in a foreign country, learn about the process of science through not only conducting their own research project but working closely with graduate students conducting research, and gain skills in research design, data analysis and management, and presentation. This experience will help all of these students learn to work across diverse social and political cultures so that they might be more effective. The students who participate in this program will share their experiences with others in the UREx program through a reading group, blogs, and social media and at a capstone symposium to be organized in 2020 by UREx fellows.


    Technical description: Cities are highly vulnerable to extreme, weather-related events, given their location along coastlines and in drylands. As urbanization continues as the main demographic trend worldwide, an ever-greater proportion of the population is exposed to hazard. Little research has been done on Latin American cities, where strategies to enhance their resilience in the face of such events may differ from US cities owing to cultural, political, or biophysical differences. The UREx SRN is a multi-city network of scientists and local practitioners, including Latin American cities, which studies, envisions, and develops innovative solutions to the challenges of these extreme events. Linked to the UREx SRN, the UREx IRES program will train students in working across cultures and disciplines and with local decision-makers. Mentors at the host institutions are collaborators in the UREx SRN and are conducting urban resilience research in these cities. The UREx IRES will afford opportunities for nine UREx fellows to expand their dissertation research into these Latin American cities, enabling projects that can be used to compare resilient solutions between US and Latin American cities. Three UREx IRES undergraduates will be selected to work on research projects in close collaboration with the graduate students, supervised by host mentors. The students' creativity is emphasized: as part of the UREx SRN they will have had experience with interdisciplinary research, training on Latin American cities, and will write a short research proposal that explains how their IRES project will integrate with their dissertation research and contribute to the overall knowledge-to-action efforts in the host city. UREx IRES fellows will be conducting transdisciplinary research with practitioners and host mentors that will advance basic scientific understanding of the characteristics of urban areas in general and infrastructure in particular that will lead to more resilient, and ultimately sustainable, cities in the future.

    This three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will annually send six U.S. students (two graduate students and four undergraduates) for eight weeks to conduct research in the hadron physics group at the Institut de Physique Nucléaire d'Orsay (IPN- Orsay) in Orsay, France.  The research projects will come from a wide range of subjects in nuclear physics including detector development, data analysis and software development.   A particular emphasis will be made to recruit women and minority participants from institutions in New England and Southern Virginia. This program will enable the students to develop collaborative thinking and communication skills in an international working environment, establish a global network with foreign scientists, and gain insight into a future career.  This program emerges from the beliefs that international collaboration will advance scholarship by stimulating global perspectives, and that students must be prepared for their careers in the increasingly globally engaged working environment of the future.

    A major focus of modern nuclear physics concerns how protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei are made of quarks and gluons, the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics. Modern studies of the nucleon structure are conducted at large-scale nuclear research facilities by large collaborations with a significant international component. This project supports US student participation in the ongoing research activities of the hadron physics group at the Institut de Physique Nucléaire d?Orsay (IPN- Orsay).  The planned projects include (1) detection efficiency studies of a neutron detector, (2) development of a nuclear fragment detector, (3) studies of the particle channeling via bent crystals, (4) performance studies of MWPC (Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber) and GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) detectors, (5) performance studies of diamond detectors, and (6) software development of 3-D modeling of the nucleon structure.  US student participation in these projects supports the development of a globally trained competitive workforce at the forefront of nuclear physics.

- abstractText: "The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) is a collaboration of
    astronomers who will use radio telescopes to detect and study gravitational waves,
    a  fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Gravitational
    waves (GW) from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes were recently detected
    by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The IPTA collaboration
    will detect GW from vastly larger and heavier black holes at the cores of merging
    galaxies, via the precise timing of cosmic clocks called radio pulsars. The astronomers
    anticipate that low-frequency GW will be detected within the next five years,
    ushering in a revolution in our understanding of the growth and structure of our
    Universe. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be fully involved in all
    aspects of the project. They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different
    countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific
    discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's
    interconnected world.\n \nThe project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using
    a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for
    small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency
    gravitational waves. The IPTA currently consists of consortia from Australia,
    Europe, and North America, using a total of seven telescopes. In order to further
    increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize
    the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and
    telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity
    for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs
    in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students
    and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international
    research experiences. The undergraduate students will be drawn from a range of
    U.S. institutions, including minority serving institutions and those in rural
    areas. They will work closely with both a U.S. graduate student also trained in
    IPTA research and their foreign mentor and students in the host country. The students
    will be trained in astrophysics, big data analysis, and radio instrumentation,
    preparing them for a range of careers."

- abstractText: "This project will evaluate sediments deposited 300-million years
    ago in France at a time of abundant ice on the planet. This project will engage
    several teams of undergraduates from underserved populations - particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states - in scientific research within a culturally
    sensitive context. A total of 13 students will travel to France over three years
    to conduct field and lab work on red sediments analogous to the types of sediments
    and landscapes familiar to them in the U.S. They will work with both U.S. and
    French scientists in collecting data in both the field and the laboratory, while
    also learning about the history and culture of a part of France with a geologic
    history analogous to that of their homeland. This project will further our understanding
    of how Earth's surface conditions can behave under conditions analogous to the
    present. \n\nThis IRES project will involve three student groups per year undertaking
    fieldwork in France. Students will test the hypothesis that Carboniferous-Permian
    strata of basins preserved near the Central Pangaean Mountains (France) archive
    a record of moderate-elevation glaciation and widespread loess deposits in the
    paleo-tropics. One PhD student and 4 undergraduates per year will participate
    in this project, and students from underserved groups, particularly indigenous
    peoples of the Plains and Southwest states, will be encouraged to participate.
    These students will conduct fieldwork to document facies attributes, including
    detailed grain-size analyses, quartz microtextural, geochemical, and geochronological
    analyses in discrete projects that when merged will test the overarching hypothesis.
    The proposed research will contribute to the experience base and expertise in
    sedimentologic/geochemical/geochronological analyses for all participants, while
    developing datasets and results that will be disseminated largely by student participants.
    Students from the Native populations will be drawn into a foreign experience that
    will widen their horizons, yet simultaneously demonstrate a place-based learning
    wherein stories of past climates are teased from studies of the land. Results
    will provide important constraints on paleoclimate of tropical eastern Pangaea.
    Support of the hypothesis would require a large shift in long-accepted reconstructions
    of climate in eastern Pangaea, whereas a failure of the hypothesis will require
    renewed efforts to understand meridional climate states across central Pangaea.
    The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is Earth?s most recent pre-Quaternary glaciation, and
    thus a common target for climate modelers, using the same models as those employed
    for climate prediction. Hence, calibrations to these models are critical for understanding
    broader aspects of Earth's climate system in both deep- and near-time intervals.
    In summary, the intellectual merit of this project lies in testing hypotheses
    of Earth?s deep-time climate behavior in order to refine our knowledge of Earth's
    climate system, including future states.  The broader impacts include providing
    students of underserved populations research opportunities that will help cultivate
    interest in science and forge new international collaborations."

- abstractText: "Nontechnical Abstract:\nWe have entered the era of ubiquitous computing,
    an era defined by interconnected devices embedded in everyday objects that become
    part of everyday activities. Ubiquitous computing, or ubicomp, is a multidisciplinary
    field of study that explores the design and implementation of embedded, networked
    computing devices. Interactions with the computational devices of the developing
    ubicomp world are challenging. Ubicomp researchers explore natural interactions
    with devices, using modalities such as speech, gaze, gestures, and touch. With
    these modes of interaction, the user's focus can remain primarily on the world
    surrounding the device. Human-computer interaction is a central issue in ubicomp,
    and it will be the focus of the work of the IRES students who will conduct research
    at two locations in Germany: at the University of Stuttgart, and at the University
    of Oldenburg. \n\nTechnical Abstract:\nOur research will explore human-computer
    interaction in three areas of ubicomp: in-vehicle interactions, interactions with
    large displays, and interactions with devices on a ship bridge. We will explore
    user interfaces for highly automated vehicles, those that can take over all control
    of the vehicle for extended periods of time, and will signal well in advance when
    the driver needs to resume control. In these future vehicles, drivers will have
    ample time to devote to non-driving tasks. The design of the user interfaces will
    have less to do with the driver?s attention to the road (as is the case in today?s
    vehicles), and more with the physical characteristics of the vehicle (size, seating
    arrangement), the characteristics of the computing environment (network speed,
    quality of sensor readings), and the presence of other people in the vehicle and
    even in other vehicles (collaboration with other passengers, and distractions
    due to the activities of other passengers). Our goal is to explore how context
    should shape the design of in-vehicle user interfaces for automated vehicles.
    In our work with interfaces for ship bridges we will evaluate how to design interfaces
    that keep the human operator?s attention on the relevant interfaces and on the
    outside world, such that the operator can safely navigate the vessel. Our goal
    is to explore how to visualize relevant entities that are outside of the operator?s
    visual focus, and how to guide the operator?s shift of attention towards these
    entities for navigation and decision making. Finally, our work with large displays
    will explore the relationships between the characteristics of the user interfaces
    such as mode of interaction and context awareness, and measures such as user satisfaction,
    task completion time, and task completion quality. Our overarching goal is to
    establish some of these relationships, and use the results to propose improved
    designs of interactions with large displays."

    simple. Lava erupts from depth and flows out at the surface. This project examines
    whether the evolution of the system is more complex, with multiple injections
    of molten rock over time transported vertically and laterally toward and away
    from the central vent of the volcano. Documentation of these patterns could indicate
    that this more complex model may be the norm, leading to a transformative discovery
    of the most abundant volcanic constructs on Earth. The project will also study
    whether primary features of the roots of volcanic systems are often preserved,
    providing a mechanism to track the growth of the deeper parts of the volcanic
    system. At least 15 students from New Mexico Highlands University - a Hispanic
    Serving Institution - and other participating universities - also Hispanic Serving
    Institutions - will study volcanic systems in the Czech Republic to achieve the
    project goal of fully characterizing the anatomy of volcanoes from the deep roots
    to the near-surface roof. Geology graduate and undergraduate students will expand
    their research skills by working collaboratively with an international team of
    geologists. A small team of media arts students from underrepresented backgrounds
    will document the project to share the overall experience of international research
    with a broad audience through public outreach programs. \n\nThrough this 3-year
    project, undergraduate and graduate students will use a unique multidisciplinary
    approach to geologic investigation that involves field- and laboratory-based research
    to better understand and challenge long-standing volcano growth models. While
    building their research experience, the students will advance understanding of
    volcano anatomy. In the Jièín Volcanic Field in the Central Bohemian Paradise
    (Èeský ráj), Czech Republic, natural erosion and quarrying activities from medieval

    m to 4 km below the original surface of the volcano. Teamed with mentors from
    the Czech Republic, France, and Poland students will interpret the magma flow
    pattern, as well as the physical process of dike intrusion, cryptodome formation,
    and magma breakout at the surface. In terms of the roots of the system, students
    will focus on well-exposed, deeply eroded volcanic-plutonic systems near Prague
    and in the northeast Czech Republic. The project team will use methods such as:
    1) primary field observations, structural measurements, sample collection for
    petrology, economic ore genesis, paleomagnetic, and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility
    analysis; and 2) geophysical surveys to map the subsurface structure. Team experts
    contribute skills sets including physical volcanology, volcanostratigraphy, geochemistry,
    exploration geophysics, magma emplacement mechanics, structural geology, and economic
    ore mineralization. Collectively, these analytical tools will be used to evaluate
    the volcanic system in the field and a laboratory setting. Engaging the skills
    of underrepresented media arts students in documenting the learning and research
    process will contribute to building the next generation of media arts and geology
    students, instilling in them a sense of global competency.\n\nThis project is
    co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences, Division of Earth Sciences."

    Talamanca (GREAT) project will use a diverse array of geoscience methods to investigate
    the origins, the current state, and the hazard potential of the Cordillera Talamanca
    (CT) in southern Costa Rica. This region is unique in Central America because
    of its lack of active volcanism, its extreme (and geologically recent) high elevations,
    and its history of unusually distributed large earthquakes. \n\nThe project will
    use resources of the University of Costa Rica: The School of Geology and the civil
    engineering research center (Laboratorio Nacional de Materiales y Modelos Estructurales,
    LanammeUCR,), and also the research facilities of the national power company of
    Costa Rica (Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, ICE).\n\nOver the course
    of three years, 18 undergraduate students will participate in the project. They
    will collect new data on seismic wave propagation, gravity field strength, and
    the shape of the Earth's surface. They will  merge new observations with existing
    data into a unified knowledge base to increase understanding of the region. They
    will analyze combined data sets to answer specific questions about this region,
    such as \"Why are Cordillera Talamanca so high?\", \"Where are zones of present
    internal deformation?\", and \"What factors control slope stability?\", and use
    newly gained knowledge to assess landslide hazards along the Pan-American highway
    in the CT. \n\nIntegration of the GREAT project into the university-wide Aresty
    Research Assistant program will raise the visibility of Earth Sciences at Rutgers,
    making participation of historically underrepresented groups more likely. Assessment
    of the program's outcomes will be helpful in devising future efforts aimed at
    expanding participation of US diverse student population in natural science research.
    \n\nThe international collaborations forged during the project will establish
    institutional links between a large US public university (Rutgers) and the premier
    research and educational institution in Central America (University of Costa Rica).
    \ \n\n\nTechnical abstract\n\nThe Geoscience REsearch At the Cordillera Talamanca
    (GREAT) research and education project will pursue three distinct research avenues.\n\n1.\tWe
    will study the interior structure of the Cordillera Talamanca region through a
    combination of gravity and seismic methods. Improved constraints on the distribution
    of density will come from a) better gravity data; and b) the integration of additional
    constraints on the geometry and chemistry of Earth's crust. These constraints
    will be inferred from the seismic structure of the Cordillera Talamanca based
    on a combination of methods using body waves from local and distant earthquakes.
    We will use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to probe the structure
    of the crust and the upper mantle, and will take advantage of numerous local and
    regional earthquakes to constrain absolute values of seismic wave speed with textbook
    geophysical exploration techniques such as seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection.
    \ \n\n2.\tWe will study the present-day deformation within the region using regional
    earthquake data from existing and newly deployed seismic observatories.  We will
    work to improve the location of regional seismicity by a) including additional
    data, b) using more advanced tools such as double-difference location, and c)
    using better models of seismic velocity in the Earth.  \n\n3.\tWe will investigate
    the landslide hazard potential for the Pan-American Highway within Cordillera
    Talamanca using remote sensing data and direct geological observations. We will
    use unmanned drones and land-based LiDAR to build highly detailed digital elevation
    models, and will combine them with microgravity surveys and background information
    on geology and seismic activity to develop case studies of landslide potential.\n\nDuring
    each of 3 years of the project a six-person cohort of undergraduate students will
    spend 6 weeks in Costa Rica, working with mentors from research institutions in
    the country. Students will collect new data and perform basic data processing
    and analysis tasks while in Costa Rica, and will develop individualized research
    projects over the course of subsequent academic year, when they will be enrolled
    in a university-wide Aresty Research Assistantship program."

- abstractText: "Explosive remnants of war (ERW) present a significant issue for Cambodia
    and other low-income countries. In response to this problem, the field of humanitarian
    ERW remediation seeks to detect, dispose, and even recycle ERW with the goal of
    rendering the ERW-contaminated land safe. Thus, these activities are of critical
    importance to the growth of affected nations and safety of their people. This
    international research experiences for students (IRES) program is focused on using
    mechatronics - a field which integrates mechanical engineering, electrical engineering,
    control systems engineering, and computer science - to develop solutions for the
    humanitarian ERW remediation community. This program, run from Villanova University
    (VU), will send 6 students - at least 2 of which will be graduate students - to
    do research in Cambodia, one of the most ERW contaminated countries in the world.
    These students will undertake a 10 week long summer program, including 7.5 weeks
    in-country. While in Cambodia, the students will collaborate with researchers
    affiliated with the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) - the premiere technical
    university in Cambodia - and the Golden West Humanitarian Foundation (GWHF) -
    one of the world leaders in humanitarian ERW remediation research and development.
    In addition to the main research goal of finding mechatronic solutions to problems
    in the humanitarian ERW remediation community, the program will also serve to
    1) strengthen an existing VU-GWHF collaboration, 2) develop globally-engaged engineering
    researchers and 3) introduce future leaders in engineering research to humanitarian
    engineering issues. \n\nThe proposed research program will focus on difficult,
    real-world problems in the area of humanitarian ERW remediation. Projects will
    be jointly agreed upon by the researchers at VU, ITC, and GWHF. Potential projects
    include robotic non-technical and/or technical survey for area reduction, automated
    visual inspection of ordinance, and communications for explosive ordnance disposal
    (EOD). In general, the fundamental research in this project has the potential
    to impact mechatronics in a number of ways, including advancements to novel robotics
    platforms, advanced control and search algorithms, new sensors and sensing strategies,
    swarm robotics algorithms, and communications."

    This award supports a collaboration between George Mason University (GMU) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).  Through this project, eighteen undergraduate students (six per year) will participate in a nine-week Summer research and training experience at CERN. CERN is among the most vibrant and international research centers in the world. Its scientific instruments - accelerators and detectors - are some of the largest and most technically complex ever built. All aspects of accelerator-focused research and design are carried out there.  While fundamental particle physics is CERN's primary mission, active work is also undertaken in nuclear, molecular, and atomic physics, as well as detector and accelerator design and computing methods and infrastructure. Participating students will attend a one-week orientation and training workshop at GMU, and then spend eight weeks at CERN undertaking research projects related to CERN's particle accelerators and detectors. The students are guided in their research by internationally-trained, CERN-affiliated scientists, engineers, or computer specialists, and are co-supervised by the PI. Participants are part of CERN?s Summer Student Programme, which hosts nearly 300 undergraduates from around Europe and other countries. For participating students, this is an international learning and networking experience that may very well turn out to be among the highlights of their academic careers.

    Principal Investigator Rubin is a member of the NA62 collaboration, a group of about 200 physicists from Europe, Russia, and North America, which is investigating ultra-rare kaon decays in a fixed target experiment using beam from CERN?s Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).  IRES participants may indicate preferences for work in any of the research areas available at CERN.  In this project, participants will be advanced STEM students recruited from US academic institutions with a highly diverse student body. At the conclusion of their Summer experiences, the student researchers will complete a presentation and a technical note reporting their research results.

    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

    The technical work of IMaD will involve integration of software and services from across the Midwest and beyond, including the Materials Commons, the Materials Data Facility, NIST Materials Resource Registry, and Citrine Informatics, to enable smooth flow of software and data among these different systems. For example, integrated authentication provided by Globus Auth will enable access to different components with common credentials (e.g., institutional credentials), and integration of Globus transfer will allow for rapid and reliable exchange of large datasets. Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

Common schemas and metadata terms will be developed and deployed to permit cross-system searching and display of information. Materials data from partners across the Midwest and beyond will be loaded into the Material Data Facility to permit easy discovery and access. Concurrently with these and other development activities, a series of workshops and meetings will be convened to engage academic, government, and industry participants in defining requirements for, and making use of, the integrated system for materials design.

    Materials innovation is a pipeline, deriving from a deep understanding and control of material behavior and properties, leading to advanced materials designs that advance economic prosperity, address national and regional energy needs, and bolster national security. Improving this pipeline requires connecting independent but thematically congruent national and regional materials design efforts to align key stakeholders, consolidate diverse materials data expertise, simplify data access, coalesce on topics of data description and interoperability, enhance and ensure the quality of datasets, and deploy scalable data services to support materials researchers. The Midwest Big Data Spoke (MBD Spoke) for Integrative Materials Design (IMaD) connects researchers in industry, universities, and government to the people and services needed to easily find, access, and use data, tools, and services for materials design. The Midwest is the ideal place for such a program. Many major national materials design efforts funded by DOE, NIST, and NSF as part of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) operate in the Midwest, and the Midwest is home to major manufacturing industries that depend critically on materials innovation for their continued competitiveness.

- abstractText: "U.S. students will work in a diverse and vibrant environment and
    collaborate with Uzbek peers who are experts in cutting-edge math research.  They
    will be exposed to unique styles of teaching and mentorship that will enrich their
    learning experience. In particular, this project will provide unique research
    opportunities for women and students from under-represented groups. Many of the
    California State University  and the University of California campuses in Southern
    California, where the U.S. students will be recruited, are Hispanic Serving Institutions
    and Minority Serving Institutions. The project will have societal benefits by
    promoting mutual understandings between the two nations.\n \nThe aim of the project
    is to give U.S. students international research experiences under the mentorship
    of a prominent Uzbek mathematician, Shavkat Ayupov, a well-known expert in Leibniz
    algebras. The PI will take three separate cohorts to Uzbekistan, 15 to 21 U.S.
    students over three years, to conduct research for two months at the Institute
    of Mathematics of the National University of Uzbekistan. The U.S. students will
    join Ayupov's research group and conduct research in collaboration with their
    Uzbek peers and mentors on topics of current interest in Leibniz algebras. Examples
    of research topics include studying properties of derivations of Leibniz algebras
    and identifying solvable rigid Leibniz algebras. The Leibniz algebras, which are
    generalizations of Lie algebras, are an important and rapidly developing area
    of mathematics with applications in general relativity, quantum mechanics and
    string theory. It is expected for each research project to result in publications
    and lead to further research collaboration. In addition to their research activities,
    the students will also take short courses on the language, culture and traditions
    of Uzbekistan to help them adjust to their surroundings. During their stay in
    Uzbekistan, the U.S. students will travel to the ancient cities of Samarkand,
    Bukhara and Khiva to learn about the cultural and scientific heritage of Uzbekistan."

    Bats are capable of swift, autonomous navigation through complex, natural environments - a feat that cannot be replicated by engineers at present. The central hypothesis behind this research is that system-level synergies between sensing, mobility, and control functions are critical factors behind achieving these unmatched capabilities of bats. To understand how these system-level synergies arise in nature, participating students will be advised by faculty teams spanning six departments to conduct interdisciplinary research projects centered on one of the following topics: acoustical scene statistics of natural bat habitats, dynamic biosonar sensing, maneuvering flight, neural control, physiological basis of sound emission and reception. All student projects will be based in the Shandong University - Virginia Tech International Laboratory in China.

    The educational outcomes of the project will be undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills between biology and engineering that will allow them to interpret biological functions from an engineering perspective and within their respective biological contexts. Furthermore, the IRES trainees will acquire intercultural competencies to work effectively in international teams. The project's scientific outcomes will enable engineers to design better integrated autonomous systems, e.g., self-navigating drones, that will have bat-like capabilities to deal with natural, unconstrained environments, such dense vegetation.

    This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago. This project will leverage and extend state-of-the-art big data bases and technologies to measure online learning, especially features of student engagement and learning associated with improved student outcome. This project has the potential to reach millions of students (while learning), hundreds of researchers while measuring human learning (from education, cognitive science, learning sciences, psychology, and computer science) and a dozen other organizations (publishers, testing organizations, non-profit organizations, teachers, parents, and stakeholders). The team brings together a unique blend of researchers from data science (Baker, Heffernan); adaptive education technology and computer science (Woolf, Arroyo); and learning sciences (Arroyo, Heffernan). It includes women and minorities (Woolf, Arroyo), people who helped develop the largest educational database in the world (Baker), developers of data science teaching materials (Arroyo, Baker), and others who have developed online tutoring systems that achieve significant student success in learning (e.g., Heffernan, Arroyo, Woolf).

    The Digital Agriculture Spoke of the Midwest Big Data Hub seeks to organize academic, industrial, and governmental sectors around the development of policies and best practices for data science and Big Data applications in agriculture, with a particular focus on automating the Big Data lifecycle for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and for plant sciences, phenomics, and genomics. This effort is necessitated by the projected growth in the global population (9.5 billion people by 2050), which will require the global agricultural workforce to produce 70% more food than our farmers do today. Historically, agricultural revolutions in cultivation, social organization, and industrialization have provided the means to increase food production. However, future revolutions must leverage the advantages provided by the modern information society. This project will serve as a catalyst for this data-driven revolution, which will be broad and societal in nature and address the triple-bottom line of being economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally sensible. Whereas the initial focus areas are specific, the resulting best practices and partnership-building will translate to and enable other areas such as remote sensing systems and farm management techniques.  An expected outcome is improved and efficient use of UAS, imaging, and genomics in agricultural sciences, ultimately leading to a more sustainable global food and nutrition system. Coordination of these activities will be enhanced through a Digital Agriculture open web portal of data science resources, designed to integrate existing information silos, facilitate collaboration, and contribute to workforce development. Educational activities and tools will be leveraged from pre-existing traineeship programs and collaborative entities, and broadened with newly developed annual workshops. Special issue-teams of academic, industrial, and governmental representatives will be used to conduct deep-learning analysis of project educational activities to identify and refine mechanisms for broadening and diversifying participation. Through these efforts, the collaboration will improve access to data assets, train a workforce with relevant skills and expertise, and will contribute to solving the Sustainable Global Food and Nutrition Security challenge.

    This project will focus on two knowledge domains important to agriculture, UAS, and Plant Sciences. These two themes of Intellectual Merit will be melded with cross-cutting activities designed to improve the management, accessibility, automation, and value of the lifecycle for data that are generated by multiple, high-throughput sensor and measurement platforms in contexts related to agriculture and agriculture production. Best practices for transport, storage, dissemination, and analysis of Big Data will be translatable and scalable to other areas such as farm management systems and precision agriculture, and will enable the access to and use of valuable data assets related to UAS and plant sciences, thereby accelerating progress toward sustainable agricultural production. Many of the ideas and methods developed under this project and the partnership-building activities that link multiple public institutions and private entities will be transferable to other disciplines that require Big Data, such as transportation, health sciences, and food, energy, and water, and will therefore generate innovation and discovery from many and complex data resources. One aspect of these partnerships is the desire to build a workforce with strong data science skillsets. To accomplish this, project activities include participation by undergraduate, graduate, and early career scientists in annual meetings, Zoom events, and webinars. Interested participants from the academic, industrial, and governmental sectors will be supported and encouraged to engage in cutting-edge research and development areas such as direct data collection of plant features by UAS, biological feature extraction through image analysis, Big Data processing pipelines, and techniques for data management and sharing. Diversity of innovation related to UAS and Plant Sciences will be encouraged through a suite of issue teams who analyze in-person and web-based trainings, goal-oriented Meetups, and conference events for diversity using deep learning techniques. These modalities for deep learning were selected for their scalability and improved access by underrepresented groups. The project has a heavy emphasis on workforce training and best practices. Workshops and webinars, including hackathons and datathons, will help both students and people already in the workforce expand their professional development.

    and ecological sciences, which are combining big data with computational models
    to better understand the social and earth systems whose complex dynamics underlie
    many of the grand challenges faced by humanity today. Organized as a Spoke in
    the National Science Foundation's Big Data Innovation Hub and Spoke network, this
    project establishes a next generation, online Computational Model Library (CMLX).
    \n\nIn the CMLX, software code for computational models used in social and ecological
    sciences is published and freely accessible to the scientific community and general
    public, and linked with an online database of scientific papers reporting on associated
    model-based science. In addition to the code library, the CMLX is developing an
    online repository to archive end-to-end workflows of model-based science, where
    the entire research process can be followed and reproduced, from data synthesis,
    to modeling, analysis, and visualization. A regional Working Group - including
    software developers, data providers, and user communities - will provide advice
    and expertise, as well as help establish community-wide standards for transparency

    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    This project brings together six universities to design and construct a patient-focused and personalized health system that addresses the fractured nature of healthcare information, and the lack of engagement of individuals in their own healthcare. By taking advantage of the enormous amount of information being created about our environment, through the confluence of real-time, mobile and wearable devices and the availability of rich social media data on patient behavior, the team will create a detailed and comprehensive picture of a patient's health, and a tool to help manage patients' engagement with their health care providers. The system has four key aims to: (1) provide a human-centered approach for integrating electronic health record data generated by traditional methods with data collected "in the wild" (such as personal fitness devices, mobile phone usage, local weather, pollution or even fast food restaurant maps, etc.); (2) develop a framework for deciding which data sources are trustworthy; (3) create a cloud-based system to allow users to view and track their own data over time and improve healthcare outcomes; and (4) provide educational outreach and community participation, particularly in minority populations, to design a system which benefits users in both the short term (through employment and education) and the long term (through increased engagement and trust).

    This project will leverage modern distributed cloud-based computing infrastructure (including mobile phones and Amazon Web Services), and the unique capacities of the South BD Hub to house and analyze the enormous volumes of health-related data that are generated every day by people, and their environment. By linking electronic medical records, external databases and data 'in the wild' harvested from patient's Internet-enabled devices, the project will address several issues related to the integration of high-resolution data for longitudinal tracking of patients. These include acceptability of the technology, particularly by vulnerable groups, usability, veracity of data collected, and scalability/integration across a large heterogeneous landscape.  By employing patient-centric agile development, the team will work with communities to implement a cloud-based architecture to improve tracking of study participants, increase the ease with which data can be captured, improve patient engagement, and facilitate care coordination. The resultant platform will integrate big data analytics, real time scalable data collection, and social media analytics on patient behavior to analyze cardiovascular disease outcomes among disadvantaged African American and Hispanic patient populations.  Additionally, the team will implement data fusion techniques to ensure the veracity of the varying qualities of data collected, and develop machine learning models to identify at-risk patient populations in order to reduce health disparities. Finally, patient engagement and health outcomes will be measured to assess the validity and success of the system.

    Vast quantities of health, environmental, and behavioral data are being generated today, yet they remain locked in digital silos. For example, data from health care providers, such as hospitals, provide a dynamic view of health of individuals and populations from birth to death. At the same time, government institutions and industry have released troves of economic, environmental, and behavioral datasets, such as indicators of income/poverty, adverse exposure (e.g., air pollution), and ecological factors (e.g., climate) to the public domain. How are economic, environmental, and behavioral factors linked with health? This project will put together numerous sources of large environmental and clinical data streams to enable the scientific community to address this question. By breaking current data silos, the broader scientific impacts will be wide. First, this effort will foster new routes of biomedical investigation for the big data community. Second, the project will enable discoveries that will have behavioral, economic, environmental, and public health relevance.

    This project will aim to assemble a first-ever data warehouse containing numerous health/clinical, environmental, behavioral, and economic data streams to ultimately enable causal discovery between these data sources. First, the team will integrate numerous health data streams by leveraging the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI, www.ohdsi.org) network, a virtual data repository that contains millions of longitudinal patient measurements, such as drugs and disease diagnoses. Second, the team will build a centralized data warehouse that contains important environmental, behavioral, and economic data across the United States, such as the Environmental Protection Agency air pollution AirData, the United States Census data on income and occupation statistics, and the National Oceanic Administration Association for climate and weather-related information. Third, the team will disseminate emerging computational methods for causal inference and machine learning to enable researchers to find causal links between environmental, economic, behavioral, and clinical factors. The team will leverage our broad collaborative network consisting of academic big data researchers, federal-level institutes (e.g., EPA, NOAA), and hospitals (e.g., Partners HealthCare) to integrate these data and to disseminate cutting edge machine learning tools. Lastly, the project will create training resources (e.g., interactive how-to guides), coordinate cross-institution student internships, and lead a hands-on workshop to demonstrate use of the integrated data warehouse. The ultimate goal of the project is to facilitate community-led and collaborative causal discovery through dissemination of integrated and open big data and analytics tools.

    The MetroInsight project is building an end to end system for knowledge discovery from real-time data streams collected through a variety of sensors, data collection and aggregation methods.  These data streams are highly dimensional with multiple sensors observing same or similar phenomena over multiple sensory spectrums and scales. These are also sometimes real-time and/or have strong timing relationships that is necessary to support metropolitan infrastructure through effective analytics and policy support. The project brings together a diverse number of partners utilities, universities, companies and cities with the ability to contribute novel tools and urban sensor data and to translate knowledge into actions. MetroInsight's unique combination of tools, data and partnerships, in part with the MetroLab Network , makes it well poised to set an example for the MetroLab programs across the nation as well as the rest of the municipal governments. The project will explore connections between multimodal datasets and urban infrastructure management to build a practical system consisting of integrated tools, as well as training a new generation of metropolitan workforce. As part of an ambitious plan for community building and workforce development, the project includes creation of new learning modules, certification programs on energy and sustainability, an online courses on sensor data analytics and new capstone projects in a new Data Science master's degree program.

    To achieve project goals, MetroInsight is building infrastructure for managing data, networks and processing that will support design of new algorithms and tools in the project. Specifically, the project is developing algorithms to transform multimodal urban data to a lower dimensional data that reflects underlying physical and social phenomena. These low dimensional data may consist of population level data suitable for dynamic processing to support real time monitoring and visualization by cityscale operators of various lifelines from transportation, communications to emergency response. To address technical challenges in complex and subtle spatiotemporal dynamics of interdependent urban networks, MetroInsight will develop metadata methods and tools that support discovery of operational interdependencies, quantification of uncertainties for decision support and to provide assurances related to integrity and security of data, compliance related to ethical and legal privacy expectations.

    Sharing of data sets can provide tremendous mutual benefits for industry, researchers and nonprofit organizations. For example, companies can profit from the fact that university researchers explore their data sets and make discoveries, which help the company to improve their business. At the same time, researchers are always on the search for real world data sets to show that their newly developed techniques work in practice. Unfortunately, many attempts to share relevant data sets between different stakeholders in industry and academia fail or require a large investment to make data sharing possible. A major obstacle is that data often comes with prohibitive restrictions on how it can be used (requiring e.g., the enforcement of legal terms or other policies, handling data privacy issues, etc.). In order to enforce these requirements today, lawyers are usually involved in negotiation the terms of each contract. It is not atypical that this process of creating an individual contract for data sharing ends up in protracted negotiations, which are both disconnected from what the actual stakeholders aim to do and fraught as both sides struggle with the implications and possibilities of modern security, privacy, and data sharing techniques. Worse, fear of missing a loophole in how the data might be (mis)used often prevents many data sharing efforts from even getting off the ground. To address these challenges, our new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. This effort has two key components:(1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) Developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses. We believe these efforts will have a transformative impact on how data sharing takes place. By moving data out of the silos of individuals and single organizations and into the hands of broader society, we can tackle many societally significant problems.

    This new data sharing spoke will enable data providers to easily share data while enforcing constraints on the use of the data. Many services and platforms that provide access to data sets exist already today. However, these platforms generally promote completely open access and do not address the aforementioned issues that arise when dealing with proprietary data. Thus, the effort has three key components: (1) Creating a licensing model for data that facilitates sharing data that is not necessarily open or free between different organizations and (2) developing a prototype data sharing software platform, ShareDB, which enforces the terms and restrictions of the developed licenses, and (3) developing and integrating relevant metadata that will accompany the datasets shared under the different licenses, making them easily searchable and interpretable. To ensure that the developed tools and licenses are useful, the project will form the Northeast Data Sharing Group, comprising of many different stakeholders to make the licensing model widely accepted and usable in many application domains (e.g., health and finance). The intellectual merit of this proposal is to design a licensing model and a data sharing platform that is widely accepted and usable as a template in many different domains. While there exist other efforts to enable data sharing (e.g., Creative Commons), they focus on the case where the data owner is willing to openly share the data on the Internet. This licensing model and the ecosystem is different since it allows data owners to enforce certain requirements stated in a data sharing agreement (e.g., on who is allowed to access the data) and also provides tools to make data sharing of sensitive information safe. The licenses and software we propose to investigate will make it easier for organizations to open up their data to the appropriate organizations, while maintaining the ability to ensure it is protected, that access is revocable, and that access controls and audit logs are maintained.

    This project supports teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them.

    This project will support teachers, administrators and researchers to collaborate around online education resources and big data. It will increase the capacity of participants in Educational Big Data in the Northeast to analyze data from schools, students and administrators and to improve teaching and learning. However, as more refined data comes from online instructional systems and the use of data mining techniques, participants will learn to search for patterns and associations and to draw conclusions about student knowledge, performance and behavior. This research addresses several grand challenges in education: 1) Predict future student events, e.g., college attendance, college major, from existing large-scale longitudinal educational data sets involving the same thousands of students. 2) Help teachers to make sense of dense online data to influence their teaching, e.g., what should they say or do in response to student activity. 3) Provide personal instruction to each student based on using big data that represents student skills and behavior and infers students' cognitive, motivational, and metacognitive factors in learning. The project will improve the capacity in data-driven education by sharing educational databases, managing yearly data competitions, and conducting educational data science workshops and hackathons. Measurable results include studying gigabytes of data to: create actionable recommendations for classroom teachers; make effective and successful predictions about students; develop new AI methods for education; and create new data science tool sets. Key outcomes include introducing many researchers to educational big data, learning analytics and models of teaching interventions. The team intends to improve classroom learning and leverage the unique types of data available from digital education to better understand students, groups and the settings in which they learn.

    Computers have been in classrooms for decades and yet educators have not identified the most effective ways of using them. Despite advances in evaluation methods to measure human learning, most researchers still use measures available 50 years ago.

    provides a 12-week research experience at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland
    for fifteen Carroll University students. The goals of the project are twofold.
    \ First, to develop students? cross-disciplinary scientific research skills by
    embedding them in projects and facilities that are not available at a small undergraduate
    institution.  To achieve this goal, each student will join a research group and
    project in the Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry at Strathcylde for a summer
    of research.  The second goal is to prepare students to thrive in an interdependent
    and multicultural scientific environment (and future career) by emphasizing the
    cultural aspects of the experience.  This program produces increased cross-cultural
    awareness and competence - derived from a pre-trip cultural competence course,
    cultural seminars overseas, and the experience of living and working in another
    culture for a summer. In order to support broader participation in this project,
    special effort is given to recruiting into the program students from groups that
    are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  \n\nThe research that the
    students will undertake is cutting-edge and highly relevant to today?s world.
    While at Strathclyde, our students will carry out individual projects related
    to alternative energy technology, nanoscience and materials chemistry.  In particular,
    they will work on self-assembled organic photovoltaic materials, redox flow battery
    systems, and nanoparticle assemblies for healthcare diagnostics and therapy.  The
    students will benefit from working on some of the most advanced instrumentation
    available, while collaborating with researchers who are pre-eminent in their fields.
    All students will present their work at local and national meetings, and we expect
    that many of the students will also contribute to peer-reviewed publications,
    thus helping to disseminate their results to the broader scientific community."

    Title: IRES: International research experience for students on the behavioral ecology and conservation of African carnivores

    Nontechnical abstract
    This international research training program allows advanced undergraduates and junior graduate students to spend extended periods conducting field research on free-living African carnivores in Kenya, building on a strong long-term program of carnivore research in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Several students each year will undertake projects designed to acquire new and useful information about the carnivores inhabiting the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, and to develop strong, long-lasting professional relationships with Kenyan scientists. A strong team of American and Kenyan trainers will help students address a broad array of research questions about the behavior, conservation and physiology of African carnivores, ranging from the evolution of their cognitive abilities to the effects of human activity on their stress physiology. Pairs of undergraduate and graduate students will be linked by topical research focus, and work closely with local experts. While in Kenya, students will receive explicit training in science writing, and present their work at an annual conference on carnivore biology sponsored by the Kenya Wildlife Service. The research opportunities offered to students here are unparalleled, not only to investigate the biology of several carnivore species that remain very poorly understood, but also to make important contributions to behavioral ecology, stress physiology and conservation biology. The knowledge acquired in this research should facilitate conservation of African carnivores, and thus contribute to the economic well-being of Kenya, which is intimately linked with revenues from eco-tourism. This research program will also contribute significantly to the professional development of a new generation of global scientists who are united in their desire to understand and protect the natural world.

    Technical abstract
    The intellectual focus of this project is the behavioral ecology, physiology, and conservation of African carnivores.  Mammalian carnivores are critical to the stability and integrity of ecosystems around the world, largely because they play key roles in regulating such important ecosystem processes as interspecific competition and predator-prey dynamics.  Despite their importance, however, carnivores are in global decline due to a combination of habitat degradation and direct human persecution. In fact, today many carnivore populations are declining even within protected areas. It has become clear in recent years that our ability to conserve mammalian carnivores, including most of those in Africa, is limited by a dearth of knowledge about many aspects of their basic biology. This international research training program aims to fill these gaps in our knowledge in regard to African carnivores, and to apply that new knowledge to improving carnivore management; this program should thus ultimately facilitate carnivore conservation across the African continent. During the proposed funding period, students will use experimental and observational methods to test hypotheses suggesting 1) relationships among social complexity, foraging demands and general intelligence, 2) endocrine substrates of cooperative behavior, 3) how anthropogenic activities affect the behavior, physiology and demography of mammalian carnivores, and 4) best carnivore management practices. This is the only training program in the United States where both undergraduate and graduate students can obtain field research experience investigating the biology of free-living African carnivores. Most past participants in this program have reported their experiences in Kenya to be life-changing, setting them on trajectories of professional development they otherwise never would have dreamed possible.

- abstractText: "This proposal focuses on providing international educational and
    research opportunities in geosciences for US students and underrepresented minorities
    in a non-traditional study abroad destination, in this case Ethiopia. Only 4%
    of international undergraduate student research experiences are in Africa. Recent
    research has documented the benefits of these international experiences including:
    increased knowledge of other cultures, world geography, cultural relativism, and
    global interdependence. Students in general show increasing enthusiasm about problems
    of global importance that have practical consequences and are strongly attracted
    to interdisciplinary courses, especially those of societal relevance. The collaborations
    in this proposal will aid the effort of developing a globally engaged workforce
    in the US and provide the opportunity for students to tackle problems of global
    magnitude as members of the world community. This project can have a significant
    impact on the participation of U.S. students in geosciences education and research
    at both participating U.S. institutions. We expect that students participating
    in the international study, research training program and field experience abroad
    will acquire knowledge and research skills in geosciences and will be encouraged
    to pursue academic and/or industrial careers in these areas. The scientists and
    students at North Carolina A&T University (NCA&T) and in Ethiopia are benefiting
    from the collaboration, as they are now developing long lasting relationships
    that create the conditions for joint global projects. \n\nEthiopia serves as an
    ideal natural laboratory for training US students in the geosciences. The main
    Ethiopian Rift and the Afar Depression region is the only location on earth, other
    than Iceland, where the transition from continental to oceanic rift is being studied.
    The East African Rift System crossing through Ethiopia is one the geologic wonders
    of the world, a place where the earth's tectonic forces are presently trying to
    create new plates by splitting apart old ones.  Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa
    is also home to some of the highest levels of atmospheric aerosols from biomass-burning
    (BB) and BB is believed to be a major driver of regional carbon, energy, and water
    cycles. Selected IRES students will work alongside research mentors from NCA&T,
    Addis Ababa University (AAU) and Appalachian State University (ASU) and student
    researchers from AAU to (1) conduct geophysics research including exploring geothermal
    energy and groundwater sources; (2) initiate long-term measurements of atmospheric
    aerosols in Addis Ababa; and (3) conduct laboratory-based studies of BB aerosol
    optical properties (4) apply Fourier Transform spectroscopic techniques to develop
    carbon monoxide (CO) emission inventories. The proposed activities build upon
    existing research capabilities at the three universities and collaborations between
    NCA&T and AAU, which have involved numerous US undergraduates in international
    research experiences. The research experiences will be conducted in a region of
    the world that serves as an ideal natural geoscience laboratory (Earth and atmospheric
    sciences) and which has traditionally been neglected for international student
    research opportunities. U.S. student participants will work alongside AAU students
    and faculty researchers who are leaders in their field on interdisciplinary geoscience
    projects that will instill Earth system science approach and have societal implications,
    including geothermal energy, water resources, plate tectonics, and relationships
    between regional air quality and climate change."

    Mohan Sankaran\nCase Western Reserve University\n\n\nThis International Research
    Experiences for Students (IRES) program will provide an international research
    experience at the Lanzhou University in China for four students from the United
    States each year.   The intellectual merit of the work is to advance the scientific
    understanding of electrostatic charging in granular systems, both generally and
    specifically for the case of wind-blown dust.  Electrostatic charging of granular
    systems is ubiquitous and has important consequences in both industrial and natural
    processes, but is very poorly understood.  The impressive facilities at Lanzhou
    University, which include a wind-tunnel and a desert research station, offer a
    unique opportunity to carry out studies in a controlled but realistic environment
    and increase our understanding of particle charging in wind-blown systems. The
    broader impact of the program is to train US students in research with a global
    perspective; China is an ideal location for such a program, as the country has
    become a worldwide leader in industry, commerce and scientific research.  \n\nThe
    specific goals of the study will be to carry out measurements of particle fluxes,
    particle size distributions, and particle charge distributions as a function of
    elevation in wind-blown dust systems.  We will also measure electric fields as
    a function of elevation which will allow us to compare with previous studies,
    and correlate with particle flux, size and charging  On one hand, we aim to understand
    how these electrostatic effects vary with parameters such as wind speed, overall
    particle size distribution, and humidity, and on the other hand how the electrostatic
    effects arise in natural conditions and what their consequences may be on dust
    migration. Our strategy will be to: (a) develop and validate methodology in laboratory
    scale experiments; (b) carry out well-controlled large scale wind tunnel experiments,
    where wind speed and direction, as well as other relevant parameters (e.g., particle
    size distribution, humidity), can be controlled; and (c) carry out field experiments
    in the desert, where the conditions (wind speed and direction, humidity, etc.)
    are not controlled and will vary significantly during the course of the experimentation,
    but where the results are most meaningful in regard to environmental and climatic
    implications.  Students will work in interdisciplinary teams, serving in different
    roles throughout the project from designing experiments to carrying out field
    studies, and analyzing data."

    Name: Erdogmus, Ece\n \n\nProposal Title:\tU.S.-Turkey Research Collaboration
    in Conservation Engineering\nInstitution:\tUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln (Omaha
    Campus)\nAbstract Date:\t03/24/16\n\nRehabilitation of historical/existing structures
    is an area ripe for research.  With an increasing number of aging structures in
    the United States, there is a growing need for workforce development to address
    the potential for historic preservation in coming years.  The goal of this project
    is to develop a cadre of experts with specialized training and global awareness
    in the engineering aspects of historical preservation projects.  To address this
    need, Dr. Erdogmus from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will collaborate with
    the Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) of Turkey.  This 3-year program will
    bring a group of nine US students to Turkey for a seven-week summer research in
    historic preservation engineering.  It is the intention of the PI to recruit at
    least 50% of the cohort each year from underrepresented groups.  The Turkish mentors
    from IZTECH are Dr. Mine Turan and Dr. Engin Aktas, representing the Architectural
    Restoration and Civil Engineering Departments, respectively.  Under the experienced
    leadership of the hosts and the PI, the US students participating in the program
    will be provided with meaningful and comprehensive research experiences comprised
    of lab-work at IZTECH campus and a variety of field-applications that involve
    historical sites. \n\nThis three year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will involve American
    graduate and undergraduate students in research projects at the interface of structural
    engineering and conservation with three focus themes: 1) Engineering- conservation
    coordination for assessment of historical structures and materials prior to an
    intervention, 2) Engineering- conservation coordination for the development of
    compatible materials for historical retrofits, and 3) Post-Intervention assessment
    and risk analysis for the collapse-safety of structures. Under each of these focus
    themes, the IRES students will conduct specific projects and tasks; namely, the
    students will: a) Develop a novel method to provide a closed feedback loop on
    complex sites, which involves a nondestructive evaluation (NDE) based rating system
    for each element correlating the visual assessments to its interior damage levels.
    \ This will then inform variant constitutive models and aid in the design for
    the conservation intervention. b) Investigate chemical and mechanical properties
    of modern cements from different locations in order to evaluate their behavior
    under extreme heat, salt water, and freeze-thaw cycles when paired with different
    historical stones. c) Develop a decision making algorithm for historical structures
    using probabilistic assessments and sensitivity analyses to identify safety concerns
    and to predict design event recurrence intervals for which a given structure remains
    safe. This algorithm will then support decisions for or against intervention,
    ensuring only a minimum level of invasive intervention applied to the historic
    site. This work is funded by the IRES program of NSF Office of International Science
    and Engineering (OISE)."

- abstractText: "Increasing awareness of environmental issues has led to interest
    in renewable energy sources and waste materials recycling. This collaborative
    project between Adelphi University (US) and Warsaw University (Poland) will address
    these topics by focusing research on the development of novel, smart materials
    for alternative energy sources and new methods of water purification using solar
    energy.  The project will increase the number of future U.S. workers who can understand
    and solve these important issues while increasing their ability to partner with
    international researchers who are also interested in these topics. This US-Polish
    International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project provides eight-week,
    photochemistry and nanotechnology research opportunity for twelve US students
    at Warsaw University, Poland. Specific efforts will be made ensuring the involvement
    of underprivileged and underrepresented in STEM minorities. Prior to their internships
    in Poland, students will spend the academic year working in research laboratory
    at Adelphi University developing essential technical skills relevant to the proposed
    research. This early-career research experience will enhance the professional
    training and education of the US undergraduate students by exposing them to modern
    instrumentation, advanced nanotechnology research, and its practical application.
    IRES students will develop global competencies through experiential education
    in an international environment motivating and inspiring young US researchers
    to invest in future research careers and become agents of change in today?s world.
    \n\nResearch efforts will focus on fabrication and characterization of nanohybrids
    combining CdX (X=S, Se) thin films with conducting polymers and wide-bandgap semiconducting
    metal oxides for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Detailed studies
    of the nanohybrids formation process and their characterization will help to identify
    the key parameters influencing the semiconductor heterojunction quality, such
    as: materials? choice, their synthesis and processing, in order to correlate their
    composition, structure and performance. The experiments proposed in this project
    will test this hypothesis. Both, material synthesis and characterization of the
    photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties will be performed using state-of-the-art
    electrochemical, spectroscopic and microscopic instrumentation available at Warsaw
    University laboratories. The US-Polish team expects to gain a better understanding
    of the basic working principles of these nanohybrid materials in order to increase
    their effectiveness and construct high efficiency solar cells and photocatalytic
    devices for environmental remediation. Successful completion of the proposed research
    would suggest solutions on some environmental issues, such as: hazardous waste
    treatment and low cost, high efficiency, alternative energy sources. The results
    of this project will be disseminated by conference presentations, journal publications
    and community outreach."

    Nanotechnology is a world-wide research enterprise. It is essential for young researchers to learn to excel in this environment. While science is universal, the process by which peers do science by communicating with each other is not. In this context, communication is about much more than language. Language is the easy part as almost all scientists speak English.  But issues of gender roles, seniority, directness, and formality all differ, to mention just a few.  This International Research Experience for Students award supports five outstanding U.S. undergraduate students per year for three years to conduct nanotechnology research at the National Institute of Materials Science in Japan. The students selected for this program are promising young scientists with an interest in nanotechnology who have already successfully completed one significant domestic nanotechnology training experience through the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network/National Nanotechnology Coordination Infrastructure (NNIN/NNCI) Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The IRES program enhances participating students? scientific skills with a more advanced research project while simultaneously building their awareness of international research culture. This program uses anew qualitative assessment instrument for measuring and increasing the impact of the research experience on global research awareness.
    The National Institute of Materials Science (NIMS) is a leading inter
    national research facility with a broad program in nanotechnology. The research component part of the program concentrates on two subfields of nanotechnology where considerable student interest is evident: energy and nanobiotechnology. The five selected students will participate in an individual focused research project under the supervision of a senior NIMS researcher. In the energy arena, projects may include real time monitoring of energy conversion processes, novel nano-photocatalytic materials for solar fuel production, and development of viable thermoelectric materials. Nanobiotechnology projects may include smart materials for biomedical applications, nanobiointerfaces for analyzing cellular function, nanostructured scaffolds for cell function manipulation, and immune system regulation through a nanoparticle mediated DNA drug delivery mechanism.

    This award is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, Directorate for Engineering Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems and Nanoscale Science and Engineering Program.

    and biodiversity conservation on tropical forests and primates\n\nMichael D. Wasserman
    & Peter A. Beck, Environmental Science & Policy, St. Edward's University\n\n\nNon-technical
    Project Description\n\nBiodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution are major
    threats to ecosystem functioning and quality of human life, especially for societies
    that directly depend upon the local environment for resources.  Addressing human-environment
    interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems. These ecosystems
    contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate
    change mitigation through carbon storage, and filter pollutants from water and
    air.  However, traditional conservation strategies that exclude local populations
    have often been ineffective leading to significant forest loss over the past several
    decades.  This NSF IRES research program will evaluate the effectiveness of alternative
    conservation strategies to maintain tropical forest ecosystems and primate populations,
    while also maintaining the livelihoods of local communities surrounding the forests.
    \ Through this research program, underrepresented students in the environmental
    sciences will gain international field research experience.  The investigators
    will integrate ecological and social research methods to address questions critical
    to fields of ecology, anthropology, and environmental policy, address current
    environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss, and
    provide STEM training for underrepresented students at two biological field stations
    in Costa Rica (La Selva and Las Cruces) in collaboration with the Organization
    for Tropical Studies.  Students will work closely with Costa Rican field assistants
    and local communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities
    for cultural exchange.  Interested Costa Rican university students will be included
    in the projects and encouraged to apply for the master's program in environmental
    management and sustainability at St. Edward's University.  At the end of the 10-week
    program, students will present their initial results to local communities and
    Costa Rican scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their
    final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional
    conferences.  An additional end product associated with this program and utilized
    by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running
    immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring
    scientific knowledge and infrastructure to a developing country.  Results from
    this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies
    for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods, particularly in tropical
    forest regions.  \n\nTechnical Project Description\n\nTropical forests are one
    of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species,
    regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local
    communities.  Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation
    has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines
    in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation.
    \ Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all
    species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN.  Efforts to preserve
    the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused
    on creating protected areas, such as national parks.  However, citizens often
    rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly
    breached in developing countries, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected
    areas.  As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected
    areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and
    other incentives.  Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives
    by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more
    effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate
    populations.  Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives:
    1. To quantify how policies integrating conservation and development objectives,
    such as ecotourism, academic research activities, and multiple-use protected areas,
    influence tropical forests and their primates, as well as how effective these
    environmental policies are at maintaining human livelihoods.  2. To provide international
    field research experience to underrepresented students in the environmental sciences.
    \ To meet these objectives, student projects will examine differences in forest
    condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, carbon storage, diversity) and
    primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, population size) across a number
    of forests at and surrounding Las Cruces and La Selva Biological Stations in Costa
    Rica that are protected for various objectives (i.e., ecotourism, research, national
    conservation).  Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on
    local community livelihoods and how this influences local perception of environmental
    policy.  Specifically, 15 ten-week independent master's student research projects
    will occur across a three-year period to survey primate populations, quantify
    behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays in country (an
    environmental endocrinology laboratory will be established in Costa Rica), conduct
    interviews and surveys of local landowners, other stakeholders, and tourists,
    and quantify forest characteristics.  By examining interactions between people,
    parks, and primates through independent, yet interrelated, student projects, we
    will be able to provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of private ecotourism,
    public protected areas, and academic research stations to maintain livelihoods
    for human populations and promote conservation of biodiversity.  Results from
    this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic, participatory,
    and research incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes.  As a
    breakdown in either natural ecosystems or human society will negatively affect
    the other, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies
    to maintain both biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to
    ensure that these policies are actually promoting sustainability and conservation."

    IRES Water Quality and Household Energy in Post-Earthquake Nepal: Long Term Protection of Community Health

    Non-technical description

    This IRES award brings together a diverse community of researchers and students from the United States and Nepal. In addition to working directly with local and international scientists, U.S. students will communicate to other undergraduate and graduate students through blogging about international research experience. Participants will also develop education materials, with help from local collaborators, to help inform community members in host countries. Upon return to their home institution, students will present their results through professional seminars and scientific publications. The students trained by this proposed program will be the future leaders of an elite international development workforce diminishing the impact of infectious disease on human health by nurturing the interaction of persons of different disciplines and skill sets to meet water, sanitation, and household energy needs worldwide.

    Technical description

    This U.S. - Nepal international research experience for students (IRES) project supports partnership between researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), the Environment and Public Health Organization, Nepal (ENPHO), the Center for Rural Technology Nepal (CRT-N), the Institute of Engineering, Nepal (IOE) and the Nepal Department of Health Services. Over a three-year period, this program will engage three U.S. undergraduate and three U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of eighteen participants, at multiple research sites in Nepal to study the aftermath of natural disaster like earthquake on microbial water quality compounded with sanitation practices. Following training and research preparation at UIUC, students will travel to Nepal, where they will be co-mentored by professors and researchers from the partner institutes. Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementation of field strategies for drinking water sampling in the affected areas; interviewing local people to understand the sanitation practices and the sustainability of relief efforts; and data collection on waterborne illnesses. Following each portion of fieldwork and sample processing in Kathmandu, participants return to UIUC to prepare collected samples for metagenomics, 16S and 18S sequencing, qPCR and bioinformatics analysis. These will be studied to identify opportunistic pathogens in collected water sample, and patterns of presence with different sanitation practices. Results will provide new insights on the risks of outbreak of diarrheal diseases after extreme natural events in developing world, and how human practices may increase or decrease these risks.

    \n\nThis program will partner students from Central Washington University (CWU)
    with top scientists from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) to explore
    tropical dry forest ecology in a world-class biological field station in western
    Mexico. Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at
    Estación de Biología, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on
    three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system
    centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses
    of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a
    major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class
    facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from México
    and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide
    an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with
    Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations.
    This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists
    by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating
    language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing
    the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The
    program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations
    with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they
    can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community.
    \n\nThe Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by
    some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in
    the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing
    a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services
    that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic
    species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance,
    SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested
    ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students
    will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding
    triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals
    the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals
    in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles
    and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to
    wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate
    ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students
    may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting
    resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras
    and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican
    highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will
    be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated
    with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive
    team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant
    and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF."

    IRES: Nanofibers for Resource Efficiency

    A thematic basis of this program is the emerging area of nanofibers. Nanofibers have diameters from one to four orders of magnitude smaller than the diameters of conventional microfibers produced by mechanical drawing.  As a result of their small size, nanofibers can demonstrate superior properties that provide critical advantages in many applications.  Nanofibers (NF) are increasingly explored in high performance filtration, batteries and fuel cells, wound healing, composite material reinforcements, blood vessel and tissue engineering, smart textiles, drug delivery, gas sensors, electronics, and catalysis. The global market for NF is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 35% between 2014 and 2020 and reach ~$1 billion by 2017.  There are huge needs in the development of sizeable and ?green? production of NF from a larger range of materials, providing easier ways for NF processing into functional structures, and developing a skilled workforce.  This IRES will provide at least 18 undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with unique hands-on experience and significant knowledge of cutting-edge NF fabrication methods, as well as NF testing and application by providing an intense research program at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in catalysis and bio-fuels in Poland. Students will develop practical skills needed to address the knowledge gaps in NF science and technology, bring their experiences back to their home institutions, and help to develop a global-capable workforce for this emerging market. By using a cohesive approach and drawing on complementary expertise, facilities and traditions across the nations and regions, will enhance the intellectual as well as the societal and economic returns of this IRES program.

    This program will provide 18 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a unique opportunity to carry out 8 week of cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofiber science, technology, and biomedical and energy applications at the Technical University of Liberec (TUL), Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research and commercialization, and at the Lodz University of Technology (UT-Lodz), a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis, Poland.  Nanofibers (NF) form a large class of materials that can exhibit nano-enabled unique properties, which are unattainable at a larger scale.  However, the growth potential of the NF materials market is still hindered by the limited ability to efficiently generate sizeable quantities of nanofibers with predictable and controllable complex, macroscopic architectures and desirable properties.  Students will work at TUL with a new, high-rate, alternating-current electrospinning (ac-electrospinning) process that unveils several new physical phenomena which help to overcome major disadvantages of commonly used dc-electrospinning, such as ?whipping? instability and residual electric charge, while increasing the process productivity by 1 ? 2 orders of magnitude. Students will explore selected NF-based materials for advanced catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity and stability in many reactions at UT-Lodz, along with other applications tested at TUL.  During the pre-trip training, foreign site work, and post-trip activities, students will focus on advancing basic understanding of all aspects of emerging high-rate ac-electrospinning, in order to direct the assembly of NF into desired configurations and to stimulate the development of commercializable processes for nanofiber-based materials for heterogeneous catalysis, biomedical uses, and other potential applications.  Overall, this program shall facilitate a broader long-term collaboration between the US and international research groups within the nanofiber research and manufacturing domain by bringing new collaborators and facilitating multiple international links between the researchers and students in related areas.

- abstractText: "IRES: Vertically Integrated Team for Structural DNA NanoTech in Denmark\n\n\tThis
    project sponsors a vertically integrated team (diverse members from education
    levels spanning high school through post-doctoral) of 5 or 6 participants per
    year from North Carolina for travel to Aarhus University in Denmark to pursue
    month-long research projects. Scientifically, the research project will advance
    the engineering of biological macromolecules (DNA and proteins) for formation
    of materials with their structures controlled on the nanometer length scale. The
    team leader will recruit participants from groups commonly underrepresented in
    science and engineering disciplines including minority and female students. This
    international research training experience will provide participants with unique
    opportunities to enlarge their scientific networks and to experience first-hand
    the benefits of cultural mixing. The project is important and deserves NSF funding,
    because it will develop molecular tools as well as scientific personnel capable
    of advancing nanoscience goals critical to the electronics and medical fields.
    US participants will benefit from significant scientific and social interactions
    with foreign students and faculty on-site in Denmark. The project will produce
    significant outcomes including cutting-edge research results and impactful research
    training experiences for participating American students. The senior investigators
    involved have received funding through the Danish National Research Foundation
    which primarily funds Danish students both in Denmark and on visits to the NCSU
    lab. IRES funding complements the Danish investment by allowing US students to
    participate in research at Aarhus.\n\n\tThe project's scientific focus will be
    on the development of self-assembling DNA nanostructures and on their application
    toward nanofabrication of electronic, photonic, and biomedical devices. The NCSU
    team has used DNA as a building material to implement molecular computers, and
    to organize proteins and metallic nanoparticles with molecular-scale precision,
    while the Aarhus team is expert in DNA-guided chemistry for programmed synthesis
    of very large organic molecules. Developing ways to control matter on the nanoscale
    by exploiting the same construction principles used by biology (i.e. molecular
    recognition) holds great promise for diverse nanofabrication and biomedical applications.
    Engineered supramolecular complexes comprised of DNA, polypeptides, and inorganic
    nanomaterials provide the right length scale, range of physicochemical interactions,
    and complexity of shapes for interfacing effectively with biological structures.
    As such, DNA nanotechnology represents a perfect approach for creating custom
    diagnostic and ?smart? therapeutic agents for medical applications. Likewise,
    these same principles and materials are ideal for developing bionanofabrication
    procedures to compete with lithography for generation of electronic devices and
    circuits. Pursuit of biomimetic materials science, including molecular engineering
    for bottom-up assembly of complex nanostructures with diverse chemical, biological,
    photonic, or electronic functions, requires highly interdisciplinary teams. This
    cross-disciplinary work will therefore provide opportunities for very broad-based
    educational experiences to the participants. The cross-pollination provided by
    IRES funded international travel will lead to molecular materials engineering
    advances which could impact many fields of science and technology through applications
    in low-power nanoelectronics, programmable nanochemistry, novel biosensors, and
    smart therapeutics for biomedicine."

- abstractText: "IRES: US-Denmark Collaboration to Create Next Generation Biosensors\n\nThere
    is a great need for the development of fast and simple detection devices for diseases
    ranging from cancer to malaria. Not only will this assist in diagnosing diseases,
    it will also help to monitor treatments and allow for a quick change in treatment
    options if required. A better way to tackle these challenges is to work with an
    interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers. The team will likely develop
    better solutions if they are not only diverse in training, but also diverse in
    culture. For this reason, we will take a diverse group of students, ranging from
    Michigan Tech graduate students, undergraduates from Michigan Tech and other universities,
    and community college students, and have them work for the summer in Denmark.
    \ Aarhus University is a world-class research institution working on health diagnostics
    for the future. The science and engineering students will be joined in this experience
    by a communications student. This student will assist the technical students in
    the creation of videos that describes their experience in the lab and the projects
    they contributed to. This is a shift is how scientific education is often taught.
    This project will break the cycle of engineers and scientists only speaking to
    one another and help open the lines of communication to show the public what is
    happening behind the laboratory doors. The technical students will greatly benefit
    from the exposure to technical communication while the communication student will
    learn more about working with technical researchers. The end product will be 18
    highly trained students who will have increased opportunity to explore technical
    careers while producing videos that explain to the public the importance of the
    research they conducted. The technical students will also create and present posters
    at a local technical conference that highlight the research conducted. \n\nToday?s
    global health challenges require interdisciplinary knowledge, international research
    collaboration, and intercultural communication competencies.  This project will
    provide international research experiences for an interdisciplinary cohort of
    students focused on early detection of malaria and cancer though an established
    collaboration with Michigan Tech and Aarhus University in Denmark.  The goal is
    to create scientists and engineers who can creatively and collaboratively solve
    future problems in health diagnostics and beyond, and we strive to increase the
    students? perspective through this international experience.  Our team consists
    of a biologist, pathologist, mechanical engineer and chemical engineers.  This
    project will explore new disease biomarkers, determine the clinical relevance
    of the biomarkers and design new microdevices that will improve clinical adoption
    of the new technology.  Over a three-year period, the proposed summer international
    research experiences will prepare, annually, a cohort of five diverse science
    and engineering students to engage in an eight-week global biosensor research
    experience and one technical communications student to document and disseminate
    the research efforts.  A unique aspect of this project is the inclusion of a technical
    communications student.  This will provide student researchers with an education
    in scientific communication, which is often lacking in current scientific education,
    but is extremely important for the future of scientific funding and public rapport
    in the U.S.  The incorporation of a technical communications student will synergistically
    teach the scientific students the difficulties and importance of scientific communication
    to the public.  It is expected that all the participants will return as more engaged
    students with an increased propensity for new ideas and collaboration.  In addition,
    the students will engage other students through poster sessions of their experience
    and professionally produced online videos that will provide the motivation for
    others to seek out international research opportunities."

    Applied optics plays a critical role in experimental science and engineering research in fields as diverse as atomic physics and fluid dynamics.  Training the next generation of scientists and engineers in cutting-edge optical techniques is a national challenge that must be met with hands-on student participation in contemporary research.  Dr. Michael Lim of Rowan University will take 15 undergraduate students, between 2017-2019, to perform 10-week-long summer projects hosted by physics groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.  NTU is a top-tier international university known for its outstanding science and engineering research.  Students will have unparalleled access to state-of-the-art laser/optical instrumentation and mentorship by Dr. Rainer Dumke and Dr. Claus-Dieter Ohl, well known international experts in their respective fields of atom optics and fluid flows.  The program is designed to immerse students in activities that include designing and constructing optical apparatus, and collecting and analyzing data.  Simultaneously, students will build the communication skills needed for future international collaboration.  Through mini-projects at Edmund Optics, Inc., they will also connect their academic work to industry, allowing them a first-hand look at the interconnectedness of academic research and international business.  A diverse student cohort will be recruited annually from Philadelphia-area institutions that include Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Delaware State University, University of Delaware, Bryn Mawr College, and Temple University.

    Leveraging the strong optics education students at this consortium of schools, the selected cohort will be assigned summer projects in the Quantum Technology (Dumke) and Fluid Dynamics (Ohl) research groups, focusing on laboratory measurements in either ultra-cold atomic physics or modern fluid dynamics.  They will run projects that use optical manipulation or measurement to study laser-frequency stabilization, laser-cooled atoms near superconductors, pattern formation in microfluidic channels, and laser-produced shockwaves in liquids.   This research may result in the co-authorship of refereed journal articles, and all students will be expected to give presentations at scientific professional meetings in the U.S.  The scientific knowledge, technical skills, and experience in global collaboration that participants acquire will provide a competitive edge as students embark on their future career paths.

    Non technical abstract:
    This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) is focused on quantifying disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities. Each year, a cohort of five U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience with collaborators at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and the University of Bonn (UBonn)  - both located in Bonn, Germany. Highlights of collaborative activities include student access to and learning from UNU-EHS, UBonn, and other international disaster risk reduction experts, student research training activities, spatial data set acquisition, and access to international scientific networks only available in Bonn. The primary student research project is to create and rigorously evaluate a Disaster Risk Reduction - Information Capacity Index (DRR-ICI). A DRR-ICI currently does not exist. The scientific purpose of the DRR-ICI is to quantify and evaluate how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities such as information availability, scale and relevancy vary within Germany and from country to country. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating unique linkages to international organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop the next generation of interdisciplinary STEM research scientists focused on disaster risk reduction and GIS. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as the DRR-ICI, will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to disaster risk reduction research and GIS potentially saving lives when disasters occur. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of both the UN and German disaster stakeholder networks that are only available by being on-site in Bonn.

    Technical abstract:
    The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between geographic information capacity and disaster risk reduction ? an area that has received little research attention despite the overall importance of geographic information for disaster risk reduction. Student research efforts to create and evaluate a DRR-ICI will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacity is itself a disaster risk factor, (b) how geographic information capacity can be tied to geographic information best practices, and (c) comparing geographic information capacities between countries and sub-national levels within countries to inform disaster management decision making. The DRR-ICI developed by students will provide practical, intellectual products for disaster risk reduction teaching and learning that can transition into real use in the event of a disaster.

- abstractText: "Nontechnical:\nThe late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) was the longest,
    most widespread glacial interval on Earth after complex, multicellular organisms
    evolved. Despite the significance of this time interval for understanding contemporary
    global change, it is understudied in non-tropical regions of Pangea. It is of
    fundamental importance to establish a deep-time perspective on changing paleoecosystems
    to predict future perturbations in global systems. We will train future Earth
    scientists in hypothesis-driven, field-based research in Argentina. The scientific
    research objectives will be met using fossils, sedimentary rocks, and the geochemistry
    of these rocks and fossils. Outreach activities aimed at increasing the participation
    of traditionally underrepresented groups in the Geosciences form the core of the
    broader impacts of the project. \n\nTechnical:\nWe proposed a multi-faceted program
    of research and student mentorship on late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) paleoecosystems.
    The LPIA is regarded as the best pre-Quaternary analogue for contemporary global
    change. Despite the significance of this time interval in the climate history
    of Earth, our understanding of the response of marine and terrestrial ecosystems
    to late Paleozoic climate and environmental change remains poorly understood.
    Our multidisciplinary research will include paleoecological, geochemical, and
    stratigraphic analyses on extensively preserved floral and faunal fossils in southern
    and western Argentina. To recruit a broader cross section of the diverse SE Wisconsin
    area to the Geosciences, our rigorous recruitment and training strategy involves
    new outreach programs created by the PIs and leveraging existing multi-institutional
    collaborations. Different cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students will
    travel with the PIs to Argentina for up to 4 weeks each year to conduct research
    on paleoclimatic and paleoecologic change during the LPIA. Respected Argentinian
    specialists will provide expertise on different aspects of LPIA paleoecosystems,
    including biostratigraphy."

    Part 1
    This proposal plans to carry out low-frequency radio measurements of cosmic magnetism through a collaboration between Arizona State University and the German Long Wavelength Consortium. Each year, the program will fund two first-year graduate students and five advanced undergraduates, who will carry out research with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new European radio telescope. Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage, LOFAR will allow for intergalactic magnetic field measurements orders of magnitude better than previously possible.

    Part 2
    Magnetic fields thread the Universe, setting the criteria for star formation in galaxies, controlling the evolution of galaxy clusters, and altering the intergalactic medium from which all galaxies formed. Yet very little is known about their properties.
    LOFAR is the first of a new generation of telescopes that operates in the extremely low frequency range between 10 and 240 MHz. Magnetic fields are primarily detected by their interactions with cosmic rays, and only telescopes at these low frequencies, which
    correspond to low cosmic ray energies, are able to make sensitive measurements far away from cosmic ray sources and out in the depths of intergalactic space. With this remarkable new tool, the projects carried out by IRES students will help to open a new window on the magnetic universe. On galaxy scales, they will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster scales, they will probe the unknown physics of the hot
    intracluster medium and the evolution of the synchrotron emitting bubbles found within it. On cosmic scales they will uncover the magnetic properties of the web of gas that connects all galaxies. Together they will be filling in a key piece of the fundamental question: what is the structure of the Universe on the largest scales?

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in field-based ecology and conservation research in the southern Africa country of Swaziland. The project will use mentoring, teamwork and innovative research to train students to address some of the planet's most pressing conservation issues. Students will work with American and African scientists to study the integration of human livelihoods and needs for agricultural production with the need to maintain the diverse and vigorous ecosystems that allow human communities to thrive. Working internationally in Swaziland, students will first gain an understanding of regional cultures, natural history, ecological theory and research techniques. Students will then spend their summer conducting independent research projects. Over the course of the project student research projects will examine how recently converted agricultural lands may alter wildlife communities and the health of entire ecosystems. As global biodiversity continues to decline and agricultural landscapes increase, this project will help us understand how to maintain biodiversity, healthy ecosystems, and human livelihoods. Additionally, the program will produce a new generation of scientists who will spread their newly found knowledge to local and global audiences and be well prepared to face our planet's growing conservation challenges.

    Global conservation efforts must embrace agricultural landscapes, because agriculture has and will continue to play a dominant role in shaping land-use practices. Nonetheless, there is only a limited understanding of how agricultural landscapes alter biodiversity and ecosystems? ability to provide resources for humans (ecosystem services). One major hypothesis for balancing agricultural production with biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is the habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Swazi and American scientists will work with students to understand the role of heterogeneity on faunal biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. One cohort of students will relate variation in the distribution of faunal communities to patterns in landscape heterogeneity. A second cohort of students will test the mechanisms that drive faunal community changes in agriculturally dominated landscapes. A final cohort of students will examine how landscape heterogeneity and faunal communities influence ecosystem functions.

    The scientific communities of the U.S. and China suffer from a lack of direct contact between their junior members of the two countries, especially students. The proposed International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program will support 24 U.S. undergraduate students to conduct research in applied mathematics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The IRES students will be assigned to teams, each consisting of two US and two Hong Kong students, and each team will work on a research project sponsored by a Chinese company or government agency. The US students will live and work at HKUST with students from Hong Kong. The project will be supervised overall by the PI, with local supervision by HKUST Mathematics Professor and Department Chair Yang Wang and Professor Shingyu Leung. The nine-week-long collaborative project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international mathematics research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will increase the visibility of U.S. students in Hong Kong and China through their activities in the HKUST campus and through their direct collaboration with Hong Kong students. The US student participants will be about 50% women and 20% from an underrepresented minority group demonstrating NSF?s commitment to participation in STEM fields by under-represented minority groups.

    The IRES project will provide U.S. students with valuable experience in mathematics research, industrial research, international collaboration, and team work at a highly-regarded research institute. The research projects and sponsors will change every year, which is by design to keep the projects at the leading edge of scientific research. All projects involve mathematics on important current problems.  Recent examples (and industrial sponsors) include Doubly Ensemble Movie Prediction with Social Media Data Using TBEEF (Baidu), Detection of Somatic Mutations in Sequenced Pair Samples (BGI), Probabilistic Radar-Based Nowcasting of Monsoonal Rainstorms in Hong Kong (Hong Kong Observatory), Improved Maximum Likelihood Detection in MIMO Systems (Huawei), and Intelligent Eye for the Visually Impaired (Lenovo). We expect each project to result in publications and lead to further research collaboration.  The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will better prepare them for their professional careers.

    The U.S. and China both suffer great life and property losses due to landslide hazards. The proposed International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program will support 18 U.S. students (two graduates and four undergraduates per year) to conduct advanced landslide research in the Three Gorges area in China during the summer of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The IRES students will attend a two-week intensive Chinese language and cultural course at the main campus of CUG and then conduct a five-week field investigation in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The field investigations will be supervised by the PI and three professors at CUG, Drs. Huiming Tang, Hanwen Zhou, and Changqian Ma from the China University of Geosciences (CUG) in Wuhan.  The eight-week-long collaborative project is designed to expose U.S. students to the international landslide research community at an early stage of their careers. The IRES project will increase the visibility of U.S. students in China through their activities in the CUG campus and in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

    The IRES project will provide U.S. students with hands-on field research experience in landslide surveying, mapping, monitoring, and early-warning. The main research objectives are to (1) develop a GPS based real-time landslide monitoring and early-warning system at the Huangtupo landslide site, (2) develop a rapid landslide mapping method using high-accuracy GPS and LiDAR integrated technologies, and (3) study the correlation of landslide movements with fluctuation of the water level within the Three Gorges Reservoir. The methods developed through this project can be modified to serve other regions prone to landslides. The knowledge and skills that students learn from this project will better prepare them for their professional careers.

    This U.S.-Czech international research experience for students (IRES) project supports a partnership between scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) and the Czech Technical University-Prague (CTU) that is designed to prepare U.S. students for STEM graduate-level study through an early career cooperative research experience focused on the earth's vadose zone, known as the geologic "skin of the earth." For each of the three years of this IRES project, cohorts of four U.S. science and engineering students will expand their global competence through a well-integrated, eight-week international research and educational experience in the Czech Republic. Principal Investigator Chittaranjan Ray (UNL), along with lead counterparts Michal Snìhota and Martin Sanda (CTU), will serve as mentors.  In their collaboration with CTU scientists and students, U.S. participants will jointly conduct hypothesis-driven laboratory experiments and field investigations designed to characterize water and chemical movement in unsaturated soils with macro pores (large pores due to wormholes, cracks etc.) at site-to-watershed scale in the Czech Republic.  The U.S. students will learn about creative, original, and potentially transformative methods the Czechs are using to study the fate and transport of water and contaminants through the unsaturated zone, particularly in terms of preferential flow.  New research results and knowledge of novel technologies being used in Europe will be shared in the U.S. through this project, thereby contributing to the development of a more globally engaged science workforce as well as to the sustainability of valuable water resources which affect economic competitiveness both domestically and internationally.

    U.S. IRES participants will collaborate with the Czech researchers to evaluate the utility and accuracy of these new methods, which promise to significantly expand scientific understanding of vadose zone processes. These are considered critical to protecting and preserving ground water resources. As the "skin" of the earth, the vadose zone, or the unsaturated zone, regulates various functions like water percolation and contaminant attenuation, among others. Over the course of their IRES research abroad, U.S. students will learn about and use new technologies and methods developed in Europe.  Understanding flow and transport processes in the vadose zone is a key to identifying ground water pollution potential and to developing mitigation strategies.  IRES participants also will work with Czech partners to evaluate the utility and accuracy of innovative Czech technologies used to study water flow at different scales. Their findings are expected to materially contribute data about the correlation of small-scale measurements of soil properties to watershed processes.  Overall, the IRES experience is intended to encourage a diverse group of undergraduate participants to pursue graduate education in STEM fields.  The U.S. students will be encouraged to publish and to share their experiences via the UNL-maintained IRES website and through presentations at appropriate professional meetings, such as meetings of the American Society of Engineering Education.

    Catlos, co-PI: Elliott, Kyle\n\nPART 1:\nThis International Research Experiences
    for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological field-based research
    and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students. Over the next 3 years,
    these students will investigate suture zones,i.e.locations where ancient ocean
    basins closed across the country. Turkey contains a large number of these zones,
    which are key locations used by geologists to understand how continents grow.
    Continental growth is considered one of the most important problems facing Earth
    Scientists, yet models for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of geologic
    record. Because of its extensive outcrops of ancient rocks associated with suture
    zones, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process.\n\nThe IRES program
    has societal value, as Turkey's suture zones can be associated with important
    ore and mineral resources or are regions of major, present-day geologic hazards.
    Older faults that worked to close the ocean basins today form regions of active
    earthquake activity or have generated topography that leads to large landslides.
    Understanding the locations and ages of Turkey's ancient suture zones has an impact
    on diverse topics, including mineral exploration and hazard reduction. This proposal
    includes partnerships with faculty at three Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul
    University, Middle East Technical University, and Karadeniz Technical University)
    who will serve as mentors. Students chosen to participate are underrepresented
    in the geosciences and are selected via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach
    programs. Students will partner with Turkish researchers to explore a range of
    geological concepts discussed in their courses while making a significant impact
    on our understanding of processes related to the formation of continental crust.
    Students will apply innovative methods to address scientific questions involving
    both the timing and impacts of Turkey's suture zones, including electronic-based
    field mapping techniques and new geochemical approaches. This in turn will lead
    to insight into how the past geological history of Turkey impacts its present
    day concerns, including the development of economically important resources and
    hazard mitigation.  \n\n\nPART 2:\nUnderstanding how continents grow is recognized
    as one of the most important geodynamic problems facing Earth Scientists. Models
    for the process are debated, due in part to a lack of exposure of the geologic
    record. Because of its extensive exposures of ancient ocean suture zones and crustal
    fragments, Turkey is an ideal location to study this process. This International
    Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program provides four weeks of geological
    field-based research and training experiences across Turkey for 12 US students.
    Over the next 3 years, these students will investigate the arc accretion processes
    that occurred in Turkey during the closure of branches of ancient ocean basins.\n\nIn
    addition, the IRES program has societal value, as paleogeographic reconstructions
    are used to identify important economic resources that formed during specific
    times in Earth's history and assess geologic hazards that result due to reactivation
    of older faults or mass movement of rocks. This proposal includes partnerships
    with faculty at 3 Turkish universities (Dokuz Eylul University, Middle East Technical
    University, and Karadeniz Technical University) who will serve as mentors. Students
    chosen to participate are underrepresented in the geosciences and are selected
    via Jackson School and UT Austin outreach programs. Students will partner with
    Turkish researchers to explore a multidisciplinary range of geological concepts
    discussed in their courses while making a significant impact on our understanding
    of processes related to the formation of continental crust. Students will apply
    new and innovative field mapping, geochemical, and geochronological methods, lending
    greater insight into the history and mechanics of the assembly of Turkey."

    science. This IRES project is designed to help meet these challenges by providing
    students and young researchers with opportunities for international training early
    in their educational and professional trajectories. This three-year project will
    support a total of 21 undergraduate and graduate students from three US institutions
    for research training and cultural experiences in Australia. The students will
    work with the U.S. PIs and Australian researchers on how dynamic environmental

    This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project aims to develop an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) system for intelligent shipwreck search, mapping and visualization. The proposed system will improve on current approaches to marine archeology, and in doing so develop novel techniques that can be applied to a general class of robot exploration tasks. First, an investigation will be launched into probabilistic algorithms that identify regions of high likelihood of containing unexplored shipwrecks that offline and online AUV planning algorithms can use to maximize information gain when searching for wrecks. Second, the development of visualization techniques dedicated to surface reconstruction that merge side scanning sonar and stereo image disparity maps while incorporating volume visualizations of marine site science data. Third, and finally, these techniques will be applied in actual AUV shipwreck search experiments in previously unexplored and under-explored areas of the Mediterranean.

    The robotic exploration technology developed in this project will be applicable to a wide range of applications in archaeology, oceanography, biology, homeland security, and defense. The Principal Investigators and student participants will disseminate research findings via publications and professional conferences, and to local community members and  public internet portal. A digital archive of sites will be created for the archeological community. This project aims to use the research findings to introduce these robotic technologies to a broad audience including elementary school children in both the US and Malta, and especially to groups typically underrepresented in computer science and engineering.  As part of the project, robotics workshops will be run at elementary schools located in Malta and Sicily.

    Non-Technical Abstract: As future bioengineers, the participating students will appreciate the impact of international differences in regulation, culture and ethics, and engineering approaches. The purpose of the program is to teach, train, and mentor under-represented undergraduates (minorities and women-U.S. citizens or permanent residents) each year via cross-cultural immersion at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)in Singapore. The project themes entail research related to transformative biomedical applications. This IRES project will enhance 1) student learning abilities; 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies. The program will provide international educational opportunities to enable participants to effectively compete as global leaders in this field.

    Technical Abstract: Efforts to engage U.S. students in biomedical research abroad, particularly those from under-represented groups are essential for training the next generation of STEM professionals who can work in a global environment. In this three year program, under-represented students will be participating in a biomedical-focused international research experience (IRES) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. The participants, all from the EPSCoR state of South Carolina, include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Program objectives will be assessed by measuring how well the IRES program trains participants in 1) research skills (e.g. learning to conduct research, data analysis, formulating research hypotheses); 2) intercultural competencies; and 3) retention and enrollment in graduate studies.
    The IRES research project is in biomedical sciences with specific importance in developing new technologies. During this three year project (2015-17), qualified undergraduates from different institutions will spend eight summer weeks at NTU in Singapore performing research with dedicated mentors.The intellectual merit of the program involves: 1) Creating specific biomedical science projects; 2) Creating well-developed research and outreach activities; and 3) Developing a specific and appropriate plan to measure the PI's goals to train all GMG fellows in the skills of STEM research and learning while living abroad. Broader impacts involve: 1) Providing summer research experiences for under-represented undergraduates designed to encourage pursuit of graduate study; 2) Providing US students from an EPSCoR state the opportunity to conduct research in a Southeast Asian research laboratory and learn intercultural competencies; 3) Leveraging the previous experience and skills of students trained in other programs; 4) Providing designed professional and cultural development activities for the students; 5) Training participants to disseminate their research to biomedical science peers; and 6) Enhancing existing collaborations between Clemson and NTU.

    Over a three-year period, this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program will engage  two U.S. undergraduate and two U.S. graduate students annually, for a total of twelve participants, at research sites in Greenland and Denmark to study Arctic microbiology and biogeochemistry under multiple climate change scenarios.  Following required training and research preparation at the University of Montana, students travel to Copenhagen for orientation and introduction to international mentors before they depart for three weeks of field work in Greenland.   Throughout, students are co-mentored by William Holben, the U.S. principal investigator (PI), and a team of experts associated with the Greenlandic Center for Permafrost Studies (CENPERM), a center that is administered by the University of Copenhagen and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.   Each student's research training will include experience with planning and implementing field strategies for permafrost, ice sheet, and hot spring and glacier sampling in a way that promotes student ownership of individual projects, while facilitating the integration of multiple data sets obtained throughout the duration of this IRES activity.  Results are expected to contribute to what is known about thawing permafrost and accelerated microbial decomposition of large amounts of organic matter stored in Arctic ecosystems.

    Following each season of fieldwork and sample processing in Greenland, participants return to Copenhagen to prepare collected samples for metagenomic DNA and mRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. These will be studied for patterns of microbial community change that reflect differing and changing environmental parameters.  Upon returning to Montana students will continue the computational and bioinformatic aspects of their studies.  Results should provide new insights into microbial community structure and activities on sheet ice and glaciers, as well as microbial biogeochemical cycling contributions to greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost soils. Over the course of this IRES program, the U.S. and CENPERM partners expect to deepen their collaboration through international teamwork, research training, and cultural interaction, as they mentor and engage a cadre of diverse students, including Native Americans, to become the next generation of climate change experts.  For broader impact, all participating U.S. students will benefit from early career experience with the kind of long-term relationship, professional network and research collaboration that is increasingly necessary to address complex global ecological issues.

- abstractText: "Part 1\nThis interdisciplinary partnership between the University
    of Central Florida and the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology (FIDMT)
    in Ilmenau, Germany is focused on adaptive conversational avatars, the rapidly
    emerging field crossing computer engineering, computer science, education, communications,
    and social science.  Immediate applications of this research field include artificial
    intellegence and national security (including cyber-security), interactive robotics,
    improvement of quality of life for disbaled, and health and caretaking for children
    and elderly.\nThis project will place students from the University of Central
    Florida under the mentorship of the PI (Dr. A. J. Gonzalez) and of Dr. Klaus Jantke,
    the counterpart at FIDMT in Ilmenau, Germany. Dr. Jantke is the director of the
    Children's Media Department of FIDMT located in Erfurt, Germany and has a long
    and illustrious history in research in computing media. The international aspect
    of innovative and advanced research is essential in modern research hence the
    PIs will work with three cohorts of students, one during each year of the project's
    existence. Each cohort will include one graduate student and either two undergraduates
    (the first year) or four (in each of the subsequent years).  The research period
    for each cohort will be 16 weeks - eight weeks in the US and eight weeks in Germany
    for each year of the grant period.\nThis research project is motivated by an ancient
    art of storytelling. In our pursuit of an artificially intelligent computer agent,
    the IRES project seeks to build a capability to autonomously synthesize possible
    scenarios for the system development and to modify them dynamically upon listener
    request. More specifically, the topic of the research in this project is the creation
    of an avatar-based system that can synthesize and adapt a scenario according to
    the user's request in real time and without any pre-scripted pathways. Good storytellers
    were treasured in medieval times, given the lack of other media through which
    to relate a story to a mostly illiterate population. Therefore, the project seeks
    to embody the storyteller in a lifelike avatar that resembles an actual person.
    This avatar will tell the story to the listener in spoken natural language, and
    interact with her/him when the latter requests changes to the story. \n\nPart
    2\nStorytelling media have evolved over time, from oral stories to modern E-books.
    Since the development of the computer, storytelling systems have become a science
    of their own, and have evolved from simple systems that can only generate a single
    short story to systems that respond to the listener's actions by modifying the
    story dynamically in real time. Digital storytelling has therefore become a growing
    field within artificial intelligence. The project seeks to take this evolution
    of storytelling media one step further by doing research to create a virtual storyteller
    who tells a dynamic story. The story is modifiable through a request by the listener
    (typically a child, a student, or an elderly person), yet will seek to remain
    realistic as well as interesting. Every story has a story space. That is, only
    so many things can happen in a story. We use contextual reasoning to represent
    the story space. In the real world, courses of action are influenced by the current
    context, making some conversational avatars very attractive while others unattractive
    when addressing the current situation within the story space. In a similar manner,
    the situation faced by the protagonist in the dynamic scenario will limit the
    choices of actions that he/she would otherwise have, thereby taking the story
    in various directions, none of which need be specifically pre-scripted.  The PIs
    base the proposed research on the use of formal methods to manipulate the story
    space within the main theme of the story. By formal methods the PIs mean that
    one represents the story knowledge formally in terms of strings, interaction sequences
    such as storyboards and graphs, formulas (for conditions), and the like. Formal
    methods, therefore, will give the ability to reason with formal methods (string
    comparison, unification, anti-unification and the like) in the story space. Formal
    methods have been used in the literature to manipulate contextual information."

    The University of Michigan and South African National Space Agency (SANSA) Space Weather International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program (UM-SANSA-IRES or MSI for short) will support 18 students (six per year) spending the northern hemisphere summer (8-weeks) at the SANSA Space Science Directorate located in Hermanus, South Africa working on a variety of space weather science and engineering projects. Space Weather is the field of space science that seeks to understand the impact of solar disturbances on the Earth's space environment especially with respect to technology.  The goals of MSI include (1) engage undergraduates in publishable research projects; (2) development of students' scientific communication skills; (3) development of culturally competent and societally aware scientists and engineers and (4) strengthening existing and developing new UM and SANSA collaborations and exchanges.

    The students will be paired with SANSA scientists, engineers and post-docs to provide one-on-one research mentoring, will participate in the annual "Space Weather Winter School" held by SANSA in June and July and attend the South African Institute of Physics (SAIP) Conference. Pre and post trip activities at the University of Michigan will provide scientific, cultural and professional development programs to enhance the impact of the international research experience. The students will also have a UM scientific mentor to engage the students prior and after the IRES experience, which will also foster scientific collaborations between UM and SANSA scientists and engineers.

    Space weather is an important area of research, especially because of the implications for communications and other crucial technologies including satellite navigation and communication systems, power grids, and ground-and-aircraft-based HF radio communication. There are significant variations in space weather effects depending on latitude, local time, and longitude, as well as northern and southern hemispheric differences depending on season. The research focus of this IRES program is to understand space weather effects at mid- and low-latitudes, differences between the northern and summer hemisphere, and between the American and African sectors. The program takes advantage of the impressive facilities and expertise available at SANSA. SANSA Space Science is currently responsible for monitoring the space environment over the Southern African region, Indian and Atlantic oceans as well as the South Pole, and forms part of a global network of similar organizations throughout the world. Instruments are deployed throughout South Africa, Namibia, Antarctica, Marion Island and Gough Island. SANSA is host to the only Space Weather Regional Warning Center in Africa and therefore develops and operates space weather forecasting models for a broad region. IRES MSI students will participate in SANSA research which includes studies on the variation of the Earth's geomagnetic field and its application to navigation, the propagation of waves in the various regions of the space environment and their effects, diagnostic information on the propagation media, ionospheric characterization, basic and applied space weather, space plasmas, and radio wave propagation.

    will send at least nine undergraduate science students and three postdoctoral
    fellows to Germany to conduct nanotechnology research at the Karlsruhe Institute
    of Technology (KIT). Three students and a postdoctoral fellow will go each summer
    for the duration of three consecutive years. The work involves the development
    of a versatile nano-scaled detection tool that could provide a high societal impact.
    In Germany, Doane students will work in the labs of Dr. Michael Hirtz and Dr.
    Pavel Levkin, both well-known internationally for their expertise on nano-scale
    phenomena. The undergraduate students will receive extensive research training,
    as well as culture and language preparation at Doane College before their departure
    to Germany. While in Germany, the research team will be given an in-depth orientation
    to the country and the research setting at KIT from the project?s Principle Investigator
    and the international collaborators. Through the PI, the student team will also
    be linked with investigators at the Center for Nanohybrid Functional Materials
    at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. The students, who are relatively
    isolated in the US heartland, greatly benefit from the exposure to a culture abroad,
    providing a new experience for them. The project provides increased student, post-doc
    fellow, and faculty understanding of the collaborative research process, as well
    as potentially motivating undergraduates to continue their studies and/or careers
    in science, technology, engineering and math. \n\nPart 2:\nThe research collaboration
    with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany will advance a technology
    called DETECHIP (short for detection chip). This is a proven sensor technology
    based on differential responses of colorimetric and fluorometric sensing elements
    upon exposure to small molecules of interest, such as drugs of abuse, explosives,
    and pesticides. \n\nDETECHIP is evolving from a macroscale, liquid-phase-testing
    array utilizing a 96-well plate to a micro-scale, solid-phase array through the
    use of piezoelectric and inkjet printing. Seeking to further miniaturize and optimize
    DETECHIP, this work will incorporate Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) that is available
    at KIT for micro-to-nanoscale array fabrication on novel polymeric surfaces. In
    collaboration with the KIT collaborators, the Doane investigators will incorporate
    the chemical sensors onto amphiphilic nanoporous (HEMA) polymeric surfaces that
    are produced at KIT.\n\nThe goal is the uniform fabrication and analysis of arrays
    for the detection of small molecules. Expected deliverables include: 1) a small
    micro-to-nanometer-scaled, polymer-supported DETECHIP array; 2) methodology for
    bench-top or portable analysis with the best imaging and/or read-out technology
    to be determined during this project period; and 3) reports documenting the efficacy,
    ease of use, and cost effectiveness of the resulting DETECHIP technology.\n\nThis
    international collaboration sets the stage for US post-docs and undergraduates
    to apply for German Humboldt, Fulbright, and DAAD-RISE fellowships, while German
    KIT students can participate in academic exchange programs with Doane College."

- abstractText: "Technical Description \n\nWith the rise in global population and
    rapid growth of urban and coastal areas worldwide, providing clean water is a
    major challenge particularly when basic sanitation needs are not met. Water scarcity,
    poor sanitation, and economic disparity tend to characterize many densely populated
    urban areas throughout the world. There is no doubt that new solutions are needed
    to improve the availability of clean water and basic sanitation for underserved
    populations. Moreover, solutions that also recover energy and resources for net-zero
    impact have the potential to lessen the burden for communities dealing with water
    scarcity, and energy and food security issues.\n\nConsequently, there is a need
    to improve fundamental knowledge on decentralized wastewater systems technologies
    (DEWATS) that lead to net-zero energy and resource use. IRES students from San
    Diego State University and California State Poly-technical University in Pomona
    will contribute to fundamental research in collaboration with the University of
    KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) on biological and physico-chemical processes in DEWATS and
    resource and energy recovery from wastewater. Students will use traditional methods
    (microbiological techniques, water chemistry and solids analyses) and novel applications
    of fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the performance of an anaerobic baffled
    reactor (ABR) with water reuse for agricultural applications. This IRES project
    aims to be a transformative scientific and cultural experience for US students
    that will advance fundamental knowledge of ABR and other DEWATS treatment processes
    implemented at the full-scale in South African communities.\n\nBroader Description\n\nThis
    project is a unique opportunity for environmental engineering undergraduate and
    graduate students to visit the UKZN in Durban, South Africa, where they will conduct
    fundamental research on resource and energy recovery from wastewater, new perspectives
    on wastewater treatment, and sustainable sanitation. Over the course of the three
    year project, fifteen US students will be supported to work on novel research
    at the nexus of water, energy, and food with a focus on decentralized wastewater
    treatment systems in growing urban centers. Students will be mentored by active
    research faculty at the Pollution Research Group at UKZN and obtain an enriching
    international experience on topics highly relevant for environmental scientists
    and engineers.\n\nThis research experience will equip upper-level undergraduates
    with research skills needed to transition to graduate school and strengthen the
    research and mentoring skills of graduate student participants. The US student
    cohorts will be recruited from groups, including those underrepresented in environmental
    science and engineering, at San Diego State University and California State Poly-technical
    University in Pomona. A pre-departure orientation program is designed to promote
    team building, cultural sensitivity, and adequate preparation for students to
    conduct collaborative research internationally. As part of the evaluation of this
    project and for knowledge transfer from cohort-to-cohort, exit surveys will be
    conducted and videos of the research and student perceptions will be disseminated
    to subsequent cohorts. Participants will present their research at UKZN and at
    local and regional research symposia, professional society meetings, or conferences.
    IRES participants will conduct outreach for K-12 audiences via after-school programs."

    In this International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the supervision of Professors Mary T. Rodgers of Wayne State University and Peter B. Armentrout of the University of Utah will participate in international collaborative research projects with Dutch counterpartners and institutions to investigate the roles of metal ion interactions in biology, energy and catalysis, and the environment.  The biological, catalytic, and environmentally oriented mass spectrometry and spectroscopic studies they carry out are expected to add to the rapidly growing and evolving research areas that interest a broad community of researchers. Each U.S. cohort will be assigned collaborate on several projects, with each student acting as the lead researcher on a particular project.  Outcomes from this IRES are expected to contribute to the underpinnings of these methodologies and add to their continuing development, while contributing to STEM workforce preparation.

    Twice a year for three years, U.S. student cohorts will travel to the Netherlands for month long research visits to participate in cooperative research projects that make use of unique Dutch instrumentation (laser systems and mass spectrometers) and cyber infrastructure at the Free Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) facility at the Radboud University Nijmegen.  The FELIX facility in the Netherlands is an international user facility supported by an advanced technical staff as well as faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows associated with the university. Planned experiments are designed to measure directly the infrared spectra of the metal-ligand complexes, thereby providing structural and mechanistic information through the analysis of the observed photodissociation pathways along with concomitant theoretical work. Because the FELIX facility welcomes a wide variety of researchers from around the globe, IRES participants should benefit from an exceptional, early career opportunity to interact with Dutch partners as well as researchers from other institutions and countries.  Theoretical calculations, additional data analysis, and preparation of the results for presentation will continue after the students return to the U.S., culminating in the expected outcome of scientific publications, under the guidance of the U.S. PIs and Dutch mentors.  Pre- and post visit surveys along with a three-year follow-up survey will be administered to assess the success of this IRES program. A website for this U.S.-Netherlands IRES program will make the results of the program available to participants, the broader scientific community, and the public.

  title: 'IRES: U.S.-Netherlands Collaborative International Research Experience for
    Students in Mass Spectrometry and Ion Spectroscopy'
- abstractText: "Dr. Adina Paytan of the University of California, Santa Cruz will
    lead a three-year International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project
    supporting collaborative research projects by 18 U.S. graduate students with scientists
    from the InterUniversity Institute (IUI) in Eilat, Israel. The project provides
    international research opportunities related to coastal zone sustainability to
    US graduate students in the geosciences. The project also trains these students
    in the processes required to formulate, design and conduct original research overseas,
    an essential skill for today?s scientists who must function effectively on multi-national
    teams and work on projects that are globally relevant. \n\nThis project focuses
    on coastal zone research, covering the complex ecosystems extending from fresh
    water systems to near-shore ocean systems. These ecosystems face numerous challenges
    and offer significant research opportunities of global importance. The students
    will work with well-regarded Israeli researchers and will use the excellent facilities
    of the IUI located on the Gulf of Aqaba. A total of six students per year over
    three years (18 total students) will participate in this summer research program
    in collaboration with scientists from IUI. \n\nThis project is somewhat unusual
    in that a clear research plan for the students is not defined at the outset. However,
    this is also a crucial strength of the project, since students will develop the
    skills needed to perform independent, globally oriented research. Students will
    apply by preparing their own proposal for a summer research project in Israel
    that complements their ongoing thesis work in the US. Students who are accepted
    will then further develop the idea in collaboration with the selected Israeli
    investigator over the course of a quarter-long planning course. The U.S. students
    will get first-hand experience in skills essential for their long term scientific
    success:  constructing scientific research questions that link local and international
    coastal zone sustainability issues,  initiating interactions with non-U.S. scientists,
    collaboratively designing and executing a research plan, dealing with logistics
    related to work overseas, communicating and disseminating results jointly with
    their collaborator, and maintaining long term relations with their international
    partners."

    Research
- abstractText: "Technical description. \nThe proposed International Research Experience
    for Students (IRES): Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies -
    Research Experience at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech -  ENPC, France (?CGPET - ENPC?)
    aims to expose Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) undergraduate and graduate
    students to geomechanical research applied to energy technologies, immerse them
    in the academic culture of a leading European institution (ENPC), and inspire
    them in the pursuit of a scientific career to improve the sustainability and security
    of energy sources and production. Undergraduate and graduate students from Georgia
    Tech School of Civil and Environmental Engineering (GT-CEE) will complete a two-month
    internship at ENPC Navier Laboratory, to work on research planned and supervised
    by dual ENPC and GT-CEE faculty mentors. Navier Laboratory gathers world?s experts
    in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, and has unique experimental,
    imaging and computational facilities especially adapted for geomechanics. Topics
    of study envisioned in this IRES involve fundamental research in the physics of
    thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical coupled processes in geomaterials, multi-scale modeling
    of porous networks, three-dimensional image analysis and advanced numerical simulation
    techniques. The ?CGPET-  ENPC? program will start with five teams of dual mentors,
    who will work on the following subjects: (1) Clay nano-poromechanics for carbon
    dioxide sequestration, (2) Characterization of particulate pore structures for
    geological storage, (3) Micro-mechanical modeling of fatigue in salt rock for
    Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), (4) Reactive fluid injection and withdrawal
    in rock, for oil and gas recovery and geothermal energy systems, and (5) Freeze/thaw
    cycles and sulfate attacks for improved cement-based buffers. Every year, a GT-CEE
    mentor will spend the last week of IRES participants? internship at ENPC, to work
    with his/her ENPC collaborator and supervise GT-CEE students? final research presentations;
    similarly the ENPC mentor will spend the week following the internship period
    at Georgia Tech. \n\nBroader description. \nFundamental understanding of soil,
    rock and cement-based materials is needed to address society?s most pressing needs
    in energy production (e.g., hydraulic fracturing, geothermal systems), energy
    storage (e.g., CAES) and waste management (e.g., nuclear waste disposals, carbon
    capture). Through their engagement in a project aimed to improve energy geotechnologies,
    IRES participants will discover the responsibility of researchers towards their
    sponsors, their scientific community and society at large. Students selected for
    this CGPET ? ENPC program will have an international experience as part of a cohort
    through cultural and professional activities, and will contribute to build and
    maintain a global network of scholars through public research presentations at
    ENPC and GT, wikipage postings, academic publications, and mentoring of new IRES
    participants. Currently, most students enrolled in Civil and Environmental Engineering
    discover soil mechanics during their senior year, through the course of Introduction
    to Geotechnical Engineering. Activities planned before, during and after the ENPC
    internships will expose a broad population of GT students to geomechanical research,
    which will provide opportunities to inspire and attract more students in the pursuit
    of a scientific career. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate
    and graduate students from ENPC and GT-CEE is expected to sustain long-term collaborations
    between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in
    energy geomechanics. This IRES will also serve a broader effort to share knowledge,
    expertise and resources between Europe and the United States, and to explore new
    ways to initiate scientific collaborations between high-ranked education and research
    institutions around the world."

  title: Coupled Geomechanical Processes and Energy Technologies - Research Experience
    at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (ENPC, France)
- abstractText: "This US-Spain IRES project further develops and expands research
    and training opportunities related to the anthropology of culture and heritage
    in Europe successfully launched in the 2010-2013 NSF-funded CHESS program (OISE-0968575).
    This project will provide an early-career international research experience for
    fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts
    Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three
    cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme
    of \"Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)\" as part of a
    three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department
    of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each
    of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research
    stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) \"Crisis,
    culture, and heritage\" (2013-2014); 2) \"Sustainable heritage, communities, and
    economies\" (2014-2015); and 3) \"Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms
    of value\" (2015-2016).   Students will be trained through a course series in
    research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing
    for publication.  International research and training workshops at the two universities
    will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars,
    as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers.  \n\nIntellectual
    merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage
    for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities
    for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are
    being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their
    projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute
    to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture
    and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed
    CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school
    that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology
    (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for
    interdisciplinary research teambuilding. \n\nBroader impacts: Government institutions
    face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse,
    multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained
    in the anthropology of heritage and related fields.  Broader impacts of the project
    include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international,
    comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates,
    2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and
    Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and
    ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department
    of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies
    and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner
    institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce
    a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management
    in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference
    presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by
    community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications
    are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally
    archived by the UMass Amherst library.  Holding an international CHESS workshop
    at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts
    enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks,
    mentoring relationships, and collaborators."
