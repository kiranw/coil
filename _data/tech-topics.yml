    seven years at the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC Australia) where he
    managed optical fiber communications R&D, including approximately 14 months in
    the UK at British Telecom’s Martlesham Heath R&D laboratories. While at OTC his
    research group made world-leading advances in high-speed optical communications
    technologies, some of which were commercialized via spin-off companies. He also
    managed the externally contracted development and commercialization of a number
    of optical fiber and optoelectronic technologies, and was instrumental in establishing
    a commercialization center for specialized optical fibers at the University of
    Sydney. While at MIKOH Corporation he was instrumental in developing and commercializing
    technologies in a range of fields including diffractive optics, laser-based marking,
    radio frequency identification and internet-based personal authentication. He
    moved to the United States in 1998 to further develop the company’s technologies and markets.
